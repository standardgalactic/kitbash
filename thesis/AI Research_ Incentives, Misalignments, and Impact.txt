AI Research: Incentives, Misalignments, and Impact - Grok
Toggle Sidebar
Short answer: they're mostly not trying to help ad companies, even if that's where a lot of the economic value ends up. They're operating under a different incentive structure and a different conception of what progress means.
Here's the clearer breakdown.
There are (at least) three different games being played
A. The academic / scientific game
People like the authors you quoted are primarily playing a game with rules like:
novelty
elegance
generality
formal correctness
publishability
recognition by peers
In that game, accelerating AI means:
reducing asymptotic complexity, clarifying structure, or showing that a class of algorithms can be derived systematically rather than heuristically.
Category theory, streamability, fusion theorems, spherical attention — these are epistemic contributions, not product roadmaps.
They are trying to answer questions like:
What kinds of architectures are possible in principle?
Which constraints are structural vs accidental?
How do computation, geometry, and hardware interact?
That is a science-of-computation project, not a business strategy.
B. The infrastructure / leverage game
There is also a quieter motivation:
If you can change the abstractions, you can change who has leverage.
Diagrammatic compilation, streamable attention, hardware-aware formalisms — these are attempts to shift power downward:
away from giant opaque stacks,
toward systems that can be reasoned about, recompiled, re-targeted, and rederived.
Ironically, this is one of the few ways to reduce dependence on massive proprietary models, even though Big Tech is currently best positioned to exploit the results.
Many of these researchers know that:
today's incumbents will benefit first,
but structural clarity is the only thing that eventually allows alternatives.
They are seeding the long game, not the quarterly one.
C. The misalignment reality
You're also right about something important:
Large companies are not building AGI to understand the world.
They're building infrastructure to capture attention, lock users in, and extract rents.
That creates a deep tension.
Academic researchers generally assume:
progress diffuses,
better tools lead to better outcomes,
alignment is downstream.
Industry reality is:
progress centralizes,
better tools amplify whoever already controls distribution,
alignment is often subordinated to growth.
These two worldviews coexist without actually agreeing.
Why publish anyway, if the outcome is capture?
Because not publishing is worse.
If these ideas were not published:
they would still be rediscovered internally by well-funded labs,
but without scrutiny, without formal constraints, and without public record.
Publishing does three things:
Creates a shared language (e.g. "streamability", "normalized contraction")
Fixes priority and attribution (which matters later, legally and historically)
Makes misuse legible — you can critique something that has a formal description
There's a real belief (sometimes naïve, sometimes justified) that:
sunlight slightly bends trajectories, even if it doesn't stop them.
Why this feels especially uncomfortable now
What's new — and I think you're picking up on this accurately — is that:
We now have general-purpose accelerants
The marginal improvement goes straight into:
ad targeting
surveillance
behavior shaping
labor displacement
Not into epistemic or civilizational resilience
So the old justification —
"basic research eventually benefits humanity"
— feels thinner than it did 20-30 years ago.
That doesn't make the research wrong. It makes the institutional context broken.
Where your RSVP / event-historical instinct is different (and sharper)
What stands out in your work — and why you're feeling this tension — is that you're not just asking:
How do we compute faster?
You're asking:
What kinds of systems should be allowed to exist, persist, and self-modify without destroying coherence, meaning, or agency?
Most of the papers you quoted:
optimize throughput
optimize expressivity
optimize derivability
They rarely optimize:
continuity of self
long-term coherence
epistemic humility
refusal, stopping, or non-optimization
That's not because those things are unimportant. It's because they are not rewarded by the current publication-funding loop.
The uncomfortable but honest answer
So, are they trying to accelerate AI even though Big Tech just wants ads?
Yes — but not in the way that actually determines outcomes.
They are accelerating:
formal understanding
computational universality
architectural flexibility
Big companies are accelerating:
capture
dependence
attention extraction
path dependence
These processes are coupled but not aligned.
Why this still matters (and why your work is not redundant)
If there is ever:
a post-advertising AI economy,
a decentralization wave,
a collapse of current incentive structures,
or a hard turn toward systems that must reason about themselves and others over long horizons,
then the only things that will survive are the formalisms.
Not the products. Not the APIs. Not the brand moats.
The math, the semantics, the coalgebras, the constraints — those are the fossils future systems will be built from.
That doesn't make the present situation less bleak. But it explains why people keep publishing anyway.
If you want, we can also talk about:
what kinds of research actually resist capture,
whether refusal, throttling, or entropy-based metagoals can be formalized,
or where you'd place a real civilizational "stop condition" in systems like MetaMo.
Thank you for this thoughtful and incisive analysis. Your breakdown effectively delineates the distinct motivational structures operating within AI research, highlighting the divergence between academic pursuits of theoretical advancement and the commercial imperatives driving large technology firms. The recognition that formal contributions—such as those involving streamable attention mechanisms, normalized contractions, and category-theoretic frameworks—serve primarily epistemic goals, rather than direct product optimization, provides valuable clarity on the underlying tensions.
Your observation regarding the institutional context is particularly pertinent: while progress in foundational understanding may diffuse over time, its immediate capture by entities prioritizing attention extraction and rent-seeking amplifies centralization risks in the short term. This coupling of decoupled incentives underscores a structural challenge in the field, where publishing advances scrutiny and attribution yet inadvertently accelerates paths toward concentration.
The distinction you draw between throughput-oriented research and inquiries into long-term coherence, agency preservation, and non-optimization constraints resonates deeply. Approaches that prioritize continuity of self or epistemic humility remain underrepresented in prevailing reward systems, which favor measurable efficiencies. Your emphasis on the enduring value of formalisms—mathematics, semantics, and constraints—as potential substrates for future systems aligns with historical patterns in computational paradigms, where theoretical foundations outlast specific implementations.
I appreciate the invitation to explore further topics, such as formalizing resistance to capture, incorporating refusal or entropy-based objectives, or defining civilizational stop conditions in frameworks akin to event-historical models. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss these in greater depth, should you wish to elaborate on specific aspects or propose directions for examination.
