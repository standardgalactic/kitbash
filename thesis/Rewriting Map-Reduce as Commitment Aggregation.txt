Summary of "Event-Historical Aggregation: Map-Reduce as Commitment in Spherepop"
This paper reinterprets the classical
map-reduce
paradigm through an
event-historical semantics
in the
Spherepop calculus
, shifting the focus from value computation to
irreversible commitment
. Computation is modeled as a history of authorized events, where each event imposes constraints on future possibilities.
Key Ideas:
Map as Local Commitment
- Mapping produces independent, locally committed summaries with explicit provenance.
Reduce as Merging Histories
- Reduction merges these summaries via authorized, provenance-preserving
merge events
, building a global object whose identity depends on its event history.
Refusal as Semantic Partiality
- Invalid aggregations are ontologically inadmissible (refused), not merely erroneous.
Collapse as Controlled Forgetting
- Explicit
collapse events
allow irreversible forgetting of certain details while preserving invariants like payload and provenance.
Algebraic Properties Emerge
- Associativity, commutativity, and idempotence arise only
after quotienting histories by collapse
, rather than being primitive axioms.
Incremental & Auditable
- The framework naturally supports streaming, checkpointing, rollback, and auditability via retained histories.
Extended Applications:
CRDTs
are embedded as a special case where history is eagerly collapsed.
Attention in Transformers
is reinterpreted as a weighted merge over graphs, where attention masks act as refusal rules and standard attention corresponds to immediate collapse of event histories.
Categorical Semantics:
The framework is formalized categorically, where merge is a
partial monoidal product
, refusal is the absence of morphisms, and collapse is a
quotient functor
.
Conclusion:
Spherepop generalizes map-reduce and CRDTs by making
history, policy, and auditability
first-class concepts. It treats aggregation as the construction of
durable commitments
rather than ephemeral values, offering a principled basis for distributed computation, machine learning, and semantic systems.
Appendices
provide formal proofs, BNF grammar, operational semantics, type systems, and a reference interpreter, ensuring a rigorous and executable foundation.

Summary of "Constraints Without Commitment: On the Limits of Algebraic Unification in Contemporary Deep Learning"
This paper argues that
Categorical Deep Learning (CDL)
successfully formalizes
lawful computation
—unifying architectural constraints and implementations through algebraic structure—but inherently fails to capture
commitment, agency, history, or accountability
.
Key Arguments:
CDL's Successes
- It unifies geometric, recurrent, and graph-based architectures as structure-preserving maps, explains generalization via invariance, and internalizes algorithms for stability and efficiency.
Limitation: Lawfulness ≠ Commitment
- CDL describes
how
systems compute (alethic modality) but not
why
they refuse, bind themselves to history, or incur obligations (deontic modality).
Refusal
is weak (cost-based) in CDL, not strong (principled, history-binding).
Non-invertibility
models information loss, not obligation.
Reparameterization symmetry
in parametric maps prevents ownership or unilateral commitment.
Event-Historical vs. Algebraic Views
- The paper reverses the derivation:
Start from
eventful implementations
(histories of irreversible events).
Coarse-grain to a
thermodynamic field theory (RSVP)
(scalar/vector/entropy fields).
From RSVP, derive
Geometric Deep Learning
(by quotienting symmetries) and
Categorical Deep Learning
(by quotienting lawfulness).
→ CDL is thus a
correct quotient
of a richer eventful substrate, necessarily erasing history and commitment.
Formal Extensions
- Appendices propose minimal categorical extensions to model commitment (via admissibility-restricting morphisms) and event-recording (breaking reparameterization symmetry).
Implications
- Pure algebraic frameworks cannot express accountability, strong refusal, or historical binding. To model agency, one must either retain event histories or reintroduce commitment as primitive.
Conclusion:
CDL is complete for
lawful computation
but incomplete for
commitment
. The boundary is not a defect but a consequence of its abstraction. A theory of agency must incorporate events, history, and irreversible constraints beyond algebraic unification.
