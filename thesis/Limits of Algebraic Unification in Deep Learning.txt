Here is a summary of the paper
"Constraints Without Commitment: On the Limits of Algebraic Unification in Contemporary Deep Learning"
:
Main Argument
The paper argues that
Categorical Deep Learning (CDL)
successfully provides a unified algebraic framework for understanding neural network architectures, but it inherently
cannot capture notions of commitment, accountability, or historical binding
. CDL excels at formalizing
lawful computation
(structure-preserving transformations), but it lacks the formal machinery to model
agency
,
refusal
,
obligation
, or
irreversible historical events
.
Key Contributions
CDL's Successes
Unifies geometric, recurrent, and message-passing architectures under a single algebraic lens.
Explains generalization, weight tying, and invariance via category theory (e.g., parametric maps, endofunctor algebras).
Clarifies why certain architectures are data-efficient and stable.
Identified Limitation
CDL models
constraints
but not
commitment
.
It can describe how systems compute, but not why they
stop
,
refuse
, or
bind themselves to consequences
.
The framework is
alethic
(about what is possible) rather than
deontic
(about what is obliged or forbidden).
Proposed Resolution
Instead of extending CDL directly, the paper proposes a
reversal of derivation
:
Start from
eventful implementations
(histories of irreversible events).
Coarse-grain to a
field-theoretic description (RSVP)
that captures thermodynamic consequences (scalar, vector, entropy fields).
Show that
Geometric Deep Learning (GDL)
and
CDL
arise as
distinct abstractions
of RSVP:
GDL forgets thermodynamic detail, retains symmetry.
CDL forgets event history, retains computational lawfulness.
Formal Demonstrations
Provides categorical constructions showing how GDL and CDL are
quotients
of RSVP.
Introduces minimal extensions to model commitment (e.g., event-recording morphisms, commitment-enriched categories).
Includes a worked example (two-digit increment with carry) showing how event records and commitment operators break reparameterization symmetry and enable strong negation.
Conclusion
The paper concludes that
CDL is complete for lawful computation
but
incomplete for modeling agency and history
. The missing elements—commitment, refusal, ownership—are not flaws in CDL but consequences of its abstraction. To model accountable systems, one must either retain event history or reintroduce commitment as a first-class primitive.
Implications
Purely algebraic theories of intelligence cannot explain why systems ever
bind themselves to past actions
.
Future work on agent-like AI must incorporate
event-aware
or
history-sensitive
formalisms.
CDL remains a powerful theory of
architecture
, but not of
agency
.

Constraints Without Commitment: On the Limits of Algebraic Unification in Contemporary Deep Learning
Author
: Flyxion
Date
: December 2025
Abstract
This paper argues that
Categorical Deep Learning (CDL)
provides a complete algebraic theory of
lawful computation
but inherently fails to formalize
commitment, agency, and historical binding
. While CDL successfully unifies architectural design through category theory, it operates in an
alethic
(possibility-based) rather than
deontic
(obligation-based) mode. To move beyond this limit, the paper reverses the usual derivation: starting from
eventful implementations
, it derives a
field-theoretic description (RSVP)
, from which both
Geometric Deep Learning (GDL)
and
CDL
emerge as distinct abstractions.
1. Introduction
CDL bridges top-down constraints and bottom-up implementation using category theory.
It reformulates heuristics as algebraic necessities and unifies diverse architectures.
Thesis
: CDL's success reveals a boundary—it formalizes constraints but not
commitment
.
2. What CDL Gets Right
Unification
: Shows geometric, recurrent, and message-passing models share a compositional structure.
Data Efficiency
: Encoding symmetries reduces hypothesis space and sample complexity.
Technical Insight
: Identifies the
carry problem
in GNNs via topological fibrations.
3. The Limitation: Lawfulness Without Accountability
CDL describes
maximally lawful, minimally accountable
systems.
Non-invertible computation destroys information but does
not incur obligation
.
Systems can compute but cannot
refuse, give, or bind themselves to history
.
4. Algebraic Constraints vs. Commitment
Algebraic Constraint
Commitment
Homomorphism requirement
Irreversible restriction of future actions
Preserves structure
Binds system to history
Alethic (governs possibility)
Deontic (governs obligation)
Symmetric under reparameterization
Asymmetric, breaks reparameterization symmetry
5. From Implementations to Architectures: A Reversed Derivation
The paper proposes a
three-level derivation
:
Eventful Implementations
(
Hist
)
Concrete event sequences (e.g.,
POP
,
MERGE
,
LINK
).
Maximally detailed, history-preserving.
RSVP Field Theory
(
Fld
)
Thermodynamic coarse-graining of histories.
Captures scalar, vector, and entropy fields.
Commitment appears as
irreversibility in the entropy field
.
Two Orthogonal Abstractions
:
GDL
: Symmetry quotient of RSVP (forgets thermodynamics, retains symmetry).
CDL
: Lawfulness quotient of RSVP (forgets event history, retains algebraic structure).

                          └─[Q_CDL]───> Comp
Q_RSVP
: Forgets event order, retains thermodynamic consequences.
Q_GDL
: Forgets energetic detail, retains symmetry.
Q_CDL
: Forgets implementation history, retains computational lawfulness.
7. Minimal Extensions for Commitment
To model commitment within a categorical framework, the paper proposes:
Commitment-Enriched Categories
: Add a preorder on morphisms to restrict admissibility based on history.
Event-Recording Morphisms
: Extend parametric maps to record events, breaking reparameterization symmetry.
Strong Negation Operators
: Introduce irreversible refusal mechanisms.
8. Worked Example: Two-Digit Incrementer with Carry
Base computation
:
inc(a,b)
with carry.
Event recording
: Logs when a carry occurs.
Commitment operator
: Once a carry occurs, a
reset
action is forbidden.
Result
: Distinguishes lawful computation from historical binding.
9. Conclusion
CDL is
complete for lawful computation
but
incomplete for agency
.
Commitment, refusal, and accountability require
event-aware
or
history-sensitive
formalisms.
The boundary is not a bug but a
consequence of abstraction
.
10. Implications for AI and Deep Learning
Algebraic theories cannot fully model
agent-like behavior
.
Future systems requiring accountability must
retain event history
or
embed commitment primitives
.
CDL remains foundational for
architectural design
, but not for
agent design
.
