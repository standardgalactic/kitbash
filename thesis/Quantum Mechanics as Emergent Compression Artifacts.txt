Here is a summary of the paper
"Indivisibility and Entropy in Quantum Theory: Wave Functions as Compression Artifacts of a Thermodynamic Plenum"
:
Core Thesis
The paper argues that quantum mechanics and cosmological expansion are not fundamental descriptions of reality. Instead, they are
interface-level formalisms
that arise when an underlying,
indivisible, entropy-driven, and irreversible process
is compressed into time-local representations.
Key Concepts
Indivisible Dynamics
Inspired by Jacob Barandes's work, quantum wave functions are not fundamental objects but
compression artifacts
that emerge when non-Markovian (history-dependent) stochastic processes are forced into Markovian (time-local) descriptions.
Temporal indivisibility means the future depends on the entire prior history, not just the present state.
Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP)
The universe is modeled as a continuous, entropy-bearing
plenum
— not expanding space or Hilbert space.
Dynamics are governed by
lamphrodyne flow
: irreversible redistribution of entropy gradients, which generates effective geometry, forces, and quantum-like behavior under coarse-graining.
Reversal of Explanatory Priority
Standard physics treats wave functions and spacetime as fundamental; RSVP treats them as
derived representations
of deeper thermodynamic processes.
Expansion, quantization, and forces are
emergent phenomena
arising from entropy smoothing and gradient relaxation.
Major Claims
Quantum Mechanics as Analytical Mechanics
Hilbert space and unitary evolution are tools to manage historical dependence, not ontological primitives.
Interference and superposition reflect
failed compression
of indivisible processes into divisible form.
Geometry and Gravity as Emergent
Spacetime metrics, curvature, and dark energy are
gauge-dependent responses
to entropy gradients, not fundamental entities.
Gravity emerges from entropy-driven flow toward regions of lowered resistance.
Complexity Across Scales
Stars, planets, chemical networks, life, and cognition are all
dissipative structures
sustained by controlled entropy export.
Autocatalytic sets
are attractors in RSVP phase space, maintaining themselves by redirecting entropy flow.
Nonlocality as Temporal Indivisibility
Quantum nonlocality and entanglement are reinterpreted as
shared irreversible history
, not action-at-a-distance.
Bell-type correlations arise from failure of temporal factorization, not spatial nonlocality.
Measurement and Collapse
Measurement is
conditioning on realized configurations
after entropy redistribution; no physical collapse occurs.
Time asymmetry is fundamental, not emergent.
Formal Results
A
lamphrodyne-modified Jeans instability
criterion is derived, showing how entropy coupling modifies gravitational collapse thresholds.
A
variational formulation
for lamphrodyne dynamics is provided, linking irreversible descent to free-energy minimization with dissipation potentials.
Memory kernels in lamphrodyne flow explain
non-Markovian behavior
and the emergence of effective quantum dynamics in low-dissipation regimes.
Implications
Quantum gravity programs fail because they attempt to quantize the
interface
(spacetime) rather than model the underlying
thermodynamic process
.
Pure states
are nongeneric; mixed density operators are the natural representation of historically entangled systems.
Physics should treat
history, entropy, and irreversibility
as primitive, not derived.
Conclusion
The universe is a
continuous, entropy-carrying plenum
whose dynamics are indivisible and irreversible. Quantum mechanics, general relativity, and other physical theories are
compression interfaces
—useful but non-fundamental descriptions forced upon us by our need for time-local predictive models. Physical laws are the stable residue of irreversible processes viewed through lossy descriptive lenses.
