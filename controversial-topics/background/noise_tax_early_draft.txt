The Noise Tax: Entropy, Responsibility, and the
Economics of Coherence
Flyxion
October 9, 2025
Abstract
The concept of entropy, traditionally confined to thermodynamics and information
theory, is herein elevated to a moral and fiscal category essential for sustainable gover-
nance. This paper proposes a triadic framework of taxation—the robot tax, noise tax,
and merit dividend—to internalize entropy across economic, informational, and epis-
temic domains. Drawing on Senator Bernie Sanders's critique of AI-driven automation
as presented in his October 7, 2025, address "AI Could Wipe Out the Working Class,"
we integrate his call for a robot tax with the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP)
model, where persistence requires the reabsorption of disorder. The robot tax addresses
labor displacement by taxing corporate automation, redirecting funds to worker sup-
port. The noise tax penalizes low-compressibility content in digital ecosystems, funding
semantic infrastructure. The merit dividend redistributes epistemic credit from indi-
vidual achievements back to collective infrastructures, countering the tyranny of merit.
Through entropy-reduction labor markets and regenerative robotics examples such as
endomarionettes, we demonstrate how these operators form orthogonal projections of a
single conservation law, ensuring coherence in civilization's metabolic flows. This uni-
fied approach reframes fiscal policy as thermodynamic ethics, aligning technological
progress with human flourishing. Entropy is the missing variable of justice in an era of
accelerating crises, and this framework provides the fiscal architecture for a civilization
capable of metabolizing its own disorder.

Introduction: Progress Without Feedback
In the era of accelerationism, where automation and attention economies drive relentless
growth, society faces a fundamental imbalance. Traditional metrics such as gross domestic
product (GDP), user engagement, and innovation rates prioritize production and extraction
over maintenance and coherence. This oversight leads to the accumulation of unaddressed
entropy in economic, informational, and social systems, threatening long-term sustainability.
The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework introduces an ethical axiom: per-
sistence requires the reabsorption of entropy. By internalizing the costs of disorder, systems
can achieve equilibrium between creation and restoration.
Senator Bernie Sanders, in his October 7, 2025, address "AI Could Wipe Out the Working
Class," situates AI and robotics amid crises of inequality and authoritarianism, arguing

they pose a threat comparable to climate change (?). He highlights how billionaire-driven
technologies exacerbate economic divides, potentially displacing nearly 100 million U.S. jobs
within a decade according to a Senate HELP Committee report.
This echoes historical
concerns over automation, from John Maynard Keynes's 1930 prediction of technological
unemployment to Wassily Leontief's 1980s warnings and Jeremy Rifkin's 1995 book The
End of Work, which lamented unprecedented technological displacement (???).
This paper aims to formalize a fiscal and thermodynamic model that holds actors re-
sponsible for the entropy they export. The proposed triadic structure—the robot tax for
economic entropy, the noise tax for informational entropy, and the merit dividend for epis-
temic entropy—provides a unified mechanism to redistribute benefits and mitigate harms.
Through this lens, technological progress is reoriented toward collective well-being rather
than concentrated power, transitioning toward the entropic accounting that underpins sus-
tainable governance.

Entropy and Externalization
Entropy, as defined in thermodynamics and information theory, represents the measure of
disorder or unpredictability in a system. Pioneering works by Claude Shannon on information
entropy and Rolf Landauer on the physical limits of computation highlight how energy
dissipation accompanies information processing (??). Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers's
exploration of dissipative structures in Order Out of Chaos further illustrates how open
systems maintain order by exporting entropy to their environments (?).
In socioeconomic contexts, entropy export manifests as the displacement of disorder from
one domain to another, such as unemployment from automation, pollution from industrial
production, spam in digital communications, or epistemic debt in knowledge extraction.
The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework models this through three fields:
the scalar field Φ representing capacity and potential, the vector field v denoting flow and
activity, and the entropy field S capturing disorder. The general conservation condition is
given by
H[Φ, v, S] ≤0,
ensuring that entropy accumulation does not exceed reabsorption rates.
This condition
underpins the need for corrective operators to internalize externalized costs.
Consider three examples of entropy export. In the economic domain, industrial pollu-
tion arises from productivity gains that displace environmental disorder, leading to ecologi-
cal degradation. Informational pollution, such as clickbait misinformation, floods cognitive
ecosystems with low-value content, eroding epistemic health (?). Epistemically, academic
prestige hierarchies extract value from collective labor while privatizing credit, fostering
inequality in knowledge production.

These externalities necessitate mechanisms to reinternalize entropy, as explored in the
subsequent sections on specific fiscal operators.

The Robot Tax: Economic Entropy
Senator Bernie Sanders, in his October 7, 2025, address "AI Could Wipe Out the Working
Class," situates AI and robotics amid crises of inequality and authoritarianism, arguing they
pose a threat comparable to climate change (?). Historical precedents, such as debates over
automation in the 20th century, underscore the need for intervention. Automation generates
productive order by exporting social disorder, such as labor displacement.
Examples from Sanders include Tesla's deployment of millions of robots replacing factory
workers, Amazon's use of over a million robots leading to tens of thousands of layoffs, Fox-
conn's replacement of 60,000 workers with plans for fully automated factories, and driverless
vehicles threatening trucking jobs (?). A Senate HELP Committee report estimates nearly
100 million U.S. jobs displaced within a decade, affecting sectors from nursing to accounting.
This aligns with historical automation anxiety, from Keynes's 1930s warnings of techno-
logical unemployment, Leontief's 1980s concerns about job scarcity, to Rifkin's 1990s predic-
tions of widespread displacement (???). Recent OECD reports echo these fears, noting that
occupations at high risk of automation account for 28% of jobs across member countries,
exacerbating inequality (?).
In RSVP terms:
dSeconomic
dt
= ∂S
∂P
dP
dt −∂S
∂H
dH
dt ,
where systemic entropy rises unless displaced human participation H is rechanneled. The
robot tax serves as a restorative feedback operator:
Reconomic = τrobot
dH
dt .
Taxation is formalized as proportional to net exported disorder:
τrobot ∝max

0, dSexternal
dt
−dSinternal
dt

.
This rebalancing enforces the RSVP condition, metabolizing entropy faster than it accumu-
lates.
Redistribution mechanisms could include wage insurance for displaced workers, imple-
mentation of a shorter 32-hour workweek without pay loss, and co-ownership models such as
employee stock programs. These policies not only mitigate immediate harms but also foster
a just technological transition, as Sanders advocates.

The Noise Tax: Informational Entropy
4.1
Definition of Compressibility
Extending the economic logic to digital ecosystems, the noise tax addresses semantic noise
as the dominant externality. Platforms maximize throughput over compressibility, consum-
4

ing cognitive bandwidth without adding coherence. Compressibility, linked to Kolmogorov
complexity, serves as a proxy for semantic density—information that adds structure rather
than noise (?).
RSVP models this as degradation of the scalar field Φ (meaning capacity) and entropy
inflation:
dSinfo
dt
=
Z
Ω
(1 −C(x, t)) dΩ,
where C is local compressibility. The noise tax imposes costs proportional to low C, penal-
izing unstructured content and rewarding high-density patterns.
4.2
Empirical Analogs
Empirical analogs include token inflation on social media, generative spam, and algorithmic
overproduction, which flood systems with low-value information. Studies on informational
pollution highlight how such content erodes trust and coherence (??).
4.3
Policy Form
The policy could involve a per-byte or per-token tax on low-information content, with rev-
enues funding semantic infrastructure like quality curation platforms. Rewards might incen-
tivize high-compression contributions, such as concise educational resources.
4.4
Case Studies
Case studies illustrate the issue: TikTok and Reels act as entropy amplifiers, prioritizing
virality over depth, while Wikipedia and StackOverflow serve as entropy absorbers through
community-maintained structure.
Scatterplot conceptualizing content density vs. attention cost: High-density content (e.g.,
scholarly articles) occupies low-attention, high-value quadrants, whereas
low-compressibility spam fills high-attention, low-value areas.
This aligns the informational economy with entropic fairness, restoring balance between
bandwidth and meaning.

The Tyranny of Merit: Epistemic Entropy
5.1
The Illusion of Individual Causality
Modern societies valorize success as the outcome of personal talent, hard work, or moral
character. This ideology—what Michael Sandel has called the tyranny of merit—frames
achievement as evidence of intrinsic virtue and failure as a lack of effort or worth (?). In
doing so, it commits a systemic cognitive fallacy that can be formalized within the RSVP
framework as the reverse fundamental attribution error: observers ascribe contingency and
circumstance to others while attributing agency and intentionality to themselves.
5

Mathematically, let Ai denote the observed achievement of an individual i. The merito-
cratic fallacy assumes a linear relation
Ai ≈fi(effort, character),
neglecting the convolution of Ai with the distributed field of collective inputs:
Ai = (E ∗C)(xi, ti) + ϵi,
where E represents environmental affordances (infrastructure, mentorship, education, prior
discoveries) and C the collective creative field generated by volunteers, peers, and ancestors.
The noise term ϵi is typically interpreted as personal risk or luck, but in aggregate it encodes
the entire evolutionary selection pressure of material and social constraints.
5.2
Collective Work as Hidden Infrastructure
Nearly every major technological or scientific advance emerges not from isolated genius
but from collective recursive labor: open-source maintainers, unpaid testers, citizen scien-
tists, and historical predecessors who have sedimented structure into the shared plenum of
possibility. This background work functions as an entropy sink for civilization—absorbing
disorder, error, and experimental dead ends so that localized success can appear clean and
self-authored.
Within the RSVP framework, this collective substrate corresponds to the scalar field Φ,
which encodes capacity and coherence across the plenum. Individuals operate as transient
vector perturbations vi within that field. When success occurs, it is because the vector flow
aligns momentarily with high-capacity regions of Φ:
vi · ∇Φ > 0.
To interpret this as individual virtue is to confuse local gradient-following with the underlying
topology of the field itself.
5.3
Evolutionary Contingency and Selection
Human accomplishment is not primarily causal but selected from the ensemble of feasible
actions permitted by physical, economic, and social constraints. Across timescales, systems
exhibiting greater adaptability and entropy reabsorption survive, while brittle or exploitative
strategies collapse.
Hence what appears as individual "merit" is often the retrospective
stabilization of trajectories that happened to resonate with ambient constraints. Evolution
rewards what fits, not what intends.
This reframes moral desert in entropic terms:
Merit ≈E

∆Sabsorbed

,
the expected capacity of an agent to reabsorb disorder from its environment. Success does
not prove inherent virtue but effective coupling to collective constraint networks.
6

5.4
Implications for the Noise Tax
The tyranny of merit thus parallels the pathology that the noise tax seeks to remedy. In both
cases, value is extracted from collective coherence while credit is privatized. Just as platforms
monetize semantic labor provided freely by their users, the ideology of merit monetizes social
inheritance while erasing its source. An entropy-aware society must therefore redistribute
not only economic returns but epistemic credit—recognizing that meaning and innovation
emerge from recursive communal fields rather than isolated acts of will.
The corrective, in both economics and ethics, is to reintroduce the missing feedback term:
dScollective
dt
= −
X
i
∇· (Φivi),
making the hidden flows of contribution explicit. This is the moral analogue of the noise
tax: a merit dividend that compensates the collective for the informational infrastructure
it provides. Only by acknowledging this distributed authorship can technological progress
cease to justify new hierarchies of desert. Recognizing epistemic entropy leads naturally to
the corrective mechanism of the Merit Dividend.
6
The Merit Dividend: Epistemic Rebalancing
If the noise tax corrects informational entropy and the robot tax corrects economic entropy,
then the merit dividend corrects epistemic entropy—the unacknowledged extraction of col-
lective intelligence by individuals or institutions that benefit from inherited order.
The Principle.
Every act of innovation or discovery draws upon a pre-existing lattice
of shared cognition—the open-source repositories, scientific traditions, educational infras-
tructures, and volunteer communities that silently reabsorb error and stabilize knowledge.
The merit dividend ensures that when an individual or corporation captures symbolic or
monetary value from this shared lattice, a proportional share of that value is returned to the
collective from which it emerged.
Let Vi denote the measurable value (economic, reputational, or informational) accrued by
agent i. Define Φcollective as the scalar field representing accumulated public knowledge and
infrastructure, and χi as the coupling coeﬀicient describing how strongly i's output depends
on that field. Then the epistemic externality is
Ei = χi
∂Vi
∂Φcollective
,
and the required redistribution rate becomes
τmerit = β Ei,
where β is a global normalization constant translating epistemic dependence into fiscal units.
7

Operationalization.
In practical terms, the merit dividend can be implemented through
multiple coupled channels:
(a) Open-source credit ledgers: Each software or scientific artifact includes a cryp-
tographic trace of dependencies. When the artifact generates profit or recognition, a
fraction of that value flows automatically to the upstream contributors weighted by
dependency depth and maintenance labor.
(b) Epistemic taxation: Corporations or foundations whose business models rely heavily
on public data, academic research, or volunteer curation pay a periodic levy into a
Cognitive Commons Fund, proportional to the entropy they extract from the shared
informational plenum.
(c) Universal creative dividends: Individuals receive baseline income or credits for
contributing to collective sense-making—writing documentation, moderating discus-
sions, annotating datasets—activities that decrease global entropy but rarely generate
market returns.
(d) Recognition rebalancing: Academic and industrial citation indices can include a
correction term for background dependency density, so that credit is allocated not only
by visibility but by the entropy reduction each work provides to its successors.
Real-world analogies include Creative Commons licenses for shared attribution, open-
source sustainability funds like GitHub Sponsors, and Wikipedia's edit credit systems that
track contributions.
Flow Before Dividend
Flow After Dividend
Extraction from collective →Private capture
Extraction →Redistribution →Collective reinforcement
Theoretical Rationale.
Where the tyranny of merit isolates achievement from its ecosys-
tem, the merit dividend restores coherence to the epistemic field. It formalizes gratitude as
a conservation law: no act of discovery can generate local order without compensating the
global substrate that sustains it. Within the RSVP framework, this is equivalent to enforcing
the invariant
⟨Hepistemic[Φ, v, S]⟩Ω≤0,
ensuring that cognitive evolution remains entropy-neutral or entropy-negative across scales.
This draws on Giddens's structuration theory and March's exploration-exploitation balance,
emphasizing organizational learning through structural coupling (??).
Cultural Implications.
A society that adopts the merit dividend in tandem with the
noise and robot taxes redefines success itself. Wealth, fame, and authorship cease to signify
isolation and instead measure the capacity to close feedback loops across the collective plenum.
The just society is thus the one in which every local gradient of excellence contributes to the
flattening of the global entropy curve. In the context of AI model training, merit dividends
could compensate contributors to public datasets, fostering equitable innovation.

Entropy Reduction as Labor
The noise tax treats informational disorder as a real cost and its correction as a productive
act.
Where traditional economies reward novelty and scale, an entropy-aware economy
rewards repair. Spelling corrections on Wikipedia, removal of spam, refactoring of open-
source code, or the literal collection of garbage are all acts that convert dispersed disorder
into structured coherence. Each such action increases the effective compressibility C of the
collective field, reducing informational entropy S:
∆Ssystem = −
Z
Ω
∆C(x, t) dΩ.
Economic interpretation.
In RSVP terms, these actions supply a positive flux of nega-
tive entropy back into the shared plenum. They constitute the inverse of extraction: micro-
reparative labor that sustains the field's coherence. The appropriate policy mechanism is
not charity but remuneration: citizens should be paid to collect garbage in any domain where
garbage exists—whether physical refuse or informational debris.
Logarithmic valuation.
To prevent trivial gaming and to reward early discovery, the
bounty for a correction or cleanup can scale logarithmically with the age of the error or the
entropy density it corrects:
R(terror) = R0 log

1 + terror
t0

,
where terror is the time since the error entered the system and R0 the base rate for im-
mediate repair. Old, uncorrected errors have propagated further through derivative works
and therefore carry higher entropic weight. Paying logarithmically more for older correc-
tions ensures that long-standing distortions—misquotations, typos in canonical literature,
uncollected trash in neglected areas—receive proportionally greater incentive.
Unified reward structure.
The same algorithm can operate across domains:
Domain
Entropy Source
Rewarded Act
Physical ecology
Waste accumulation
Garbage collection, recycling
Digital knowledge
Typos, misinformation
Error correction, citation repair
Software ecosystems
Legacy bugs, dead code
Refactoring, documentation updates
Civic discourse
Spam, disinformation
Moderation, fact-checking
Each task reduces local disorder while teaching the agent about the system's structure—a
coupling of cognitive and thermodynamic eﬀiciency. The cumulative metric for payment is
therefore not just quantity of actions but entropy absorbed:
W =
Z T
0

dSexternal
dt
 dt,
Reward = γW,
9

with γ a fixed conversion rate from entropy units to currency.
Case studies include open-source maintainers addressing legacy bugs, janitorial labor in
physical spaces, and fact-checkers combating disinformation, all undervalued in traditional
economies.
Moral consequence.
Where the tyranny of merit rewards extraction and visibility, the
entropy-reduction economy rewards maintenance and care. It reverses the moral direction
of work: success is measured not by the novelty one produces, but by the disorder one
successfully reabsorbs. In this schema, a person who collects trash or finds a decade-old typo
in a scientific paper performs the same essential act as an engineer debugging an unstable
network: converting noise into structure. Both are instances of RSVP's universal criterion
for persistence,
⟨H[Φ, v, S]⟩Ω≤0,
which demands that each participant, however small, contribute to the continuous re-
integration of entropy into meaning. This links to Sanders's vision of a shorter workweek,
redistributing time toward such reparative activities.
8
Integration: The Merit Dividend and the Entropy-
Reduction Market
The entropy-reduction economy forms the operational substrate of the Merit Dividend.
While the dividend redistributes epistemic credit from innovation back to the collective,
the entropy-reduction market channels that redistributed value toward those performing the
day-to-day work of coherence restoration.
Conceptual coupling.
In the RSVP formalism, both creation and correction are phases
of the same operator:
H[Φ, v, S] =
Hcreative
| {z }
entropy export
+
Hrestorative
|
{z
}
entropy reabsorption
.
The merit dividend allocates funds according to the exported component, taxing those who
benefit from collective structure. The entropy-reduction market allocates payouts according
to the restorative component, rewarding those who reintegrate disorder. The equilibrium
condition for a coherent society is:
⟨Hcreative + Hrestorative⟩Ω= 0.
Automatic payment architecture.
Each verified entropy-reduction event (a corrected
error, removed spam, fixed bug, cleaned site) generates a micropayment from the collective
fund established through merit and noise taxes. A distributed ledger records the event with
three fields:
(i) Entropy delta ∆Si: quantitative estimate of disorder removed.
10

(ii) Age multiplier log(1+ti/t0): compensates for long-lived or deeply propagated errors.
(iii) Verification hash: consensus proof from peers or algorithmic cross-check confirming
that the correction holds.
The total reward becomes:
Ri = γ ∆Si log

1 + ti
t0

,
paid automatically from the Cognitive Commons Fund financed by the merit dividend and
noise tax.
This closes the loop: value extracted from collective insight flows back into
collective maintenance.
Consider a simulation: A user corrects a longstanding typo in a Wikipedia article on
automation history. The ledger registers ∆Si based on page views impacted, applies the age
multiplier for the error's duration, and verifies via community consensus. Funds from tech
firms' epistemic taxes flow as micropayment, incentivizing further maintenance.
Human recognition as thermodynamic currency.
Although denominated in currency,
the deeper reward structure is reputational. Each entropy-reduction event carries a signature
in the ledger, contributing to a participant's coherence index:
κi =
Z T
0

dSexternal,i
dt
 dt,
which replaces conventional metrics of productivity with a measure of sustained systemic
stabilization. High-κ agents are not merely "productive" but entropically responsible—they
leave the collective plenum more ordered than they found it.
Societal effect.
In this configuration, the Merit Dividend and the Noise Tax cease to
be abstract redistributive policies. Together they form a coherent feedback circuit in the
thermodynamic economy of meaning:
Extraction (creation) →Redistribution (dividend) →Reabsorption (entropy
labor).
Those who profit most from the collective's order fund those who labor to maintain it.
Those who maintain it preserve the very conditions for future creation. The outcome is an
economy where value is measured not by acceleration or accumulation, but by the continuity
of coherence in the scalar field Φ.
Governance and Oversight.
Effective implementation requires oversight councils to set
entropy metrics, verification algorithms to prevent fraud, and civic trust models to ensure
participation. Pilot programs on platforms like GitHub or civic apps could test ledger func-
tionality, scaling to national entropy-balance systems.

Endomarionettes: Embodied Entropy Reabsorption
Not all automation externalizes entropy. While the robot tax proposed by Sanders applies
to high-capital, labor-displacing automation that offloads social disorder for private gain,
certain forms of embodied automation—notably endomarionettes constructed from house-
hold or biodegradable materials—do the opposite. They function as entropy absorbers, not
emitters.
Material and Dynamic Principles.
Endomarionettes are lightweight robotic organisms
built from low-cost, compliant materials: paper-mâché, bread paste, yogurt glue, kombucha
(SCOBY) leather, or other bio-derived composites. They are actuated by internal pneumatic
bladders or tendon-like strings that pull against flexible joints. Their structural fragility is
not a defect but an informational feature: each deformation or leak serves as feedback to
stabilize higher-level motion.
Instead of rigid control, they employ hierarchical Central Pattern Generator (CPG)
chains, modeled after biological gait oscillators:
Trunk CPG →Hip/Knee CPGs →Ankle Reflex Loops.
These oscillators entrain through phase coupling, allowing local irregularities to be reab-
sorbed as rhythmic variation rather than mechanical failure.
The governing principle is
recursive entropy smoothing:
dSlocal
dt
= −∇· (Φv) + Qfeedback,
where Qfeedback > 0 represents the rate at which internal noise is converted into stabiliz-
ing information.
This contrasts with opaque, centralized AI infrastructure, emphasizing
repairability and permeability in material philosophy (??).
To build a basic endomarionette: Form a truss skeleton with tape and straws, attach
antagonistic balloon bladders at joints for torque, route strings through straws for tendon
control, and integrate pressure sensors for reflexes.
Change Magnification.
For training, rehabilitation, or educational use, endomarionettes
can employ a function
δr = G(ϕ) δh,
G′(ϕ) > 0,
mapping small human input δh into large robotic motion δr. This change magnification
amplifies feedback and supports learning without large mechanical energy flows, keeping the
total entropic footprint low.
Why They Are Exempt.
The robot tax applies when automation externalizes entropy—
that is, when a corporation uses robotics to increase profit while exporting social disorder
(unemployment, deskilling, concentration of wealth). By contrast, endomarionettes:
(a) Do not displace labor. They are typically operated, modified, and repaired by their
users; they create work rather than erase it.
12

(b) Localize production. Made from household materials, they generate no large-scale
capital externality or offshored manufacturing entropy.
(c) Metabolize noise internally.
Their softness and feedback structure ensure that
errors, flex, and drift become part of the control loop, not waste products.
(d) Support education and skill formation. They transform mechanical noise into
pedagogical information, serving as entropy sinks for human learning.
Therefore, in an RSVP-informed policy regime, the tax liability τrobot would be defined
by net exported entropy:
τrobot ∝max

0, dSexternal
dt
−dSinternal
dt

.
For high-capital automation, dSexternal
dt
≫0 and the tax is positive. For endomarionettes and
other regenerative robotics, dSinternal
dt
≥dSexternal
dt
, yielding τrobot ≈0.
Interpretation.
Such devices embody the same ethics as the noise tax: entropy is not
avoided but domesticated.
Where industrial robotics export disorder into society, low-
entropy robotics—built from paper, yogurt, and air—recycle it into coherence. Their ex-
emption from the robot tax reflects not indulgence but fidelity to the governing thermo-
dynamic law of RSVP: enduring systems persist only by reabsorbing the noise they create.
These fragile machines demonstrate that the future of automation lies not in power but in
permeability.
Policy Footnote: Definition of Entropic Exemption.
To integrate the above princi-
ples into governance, we define a robotics or automation system as entropically exempt from
taxation when it satisfies the following empirical inequality over its operational domain Ω:
Z
Ω
dSexternal
dt
−dSinternal
dt

dΩ≤0.
In practice, this means that the system's design, fabrication, and use collectively reabsorb
as much entropy (in the form of waste, disorder, or social cost) as they emit. The evaluation
can be performed along three complementary axes:
(i) Material Circularity: Proportion of components made from biodegradable, recy-
clable, or locally sourced matter. Systems with closed or regenerative material loops
score Smat
external ≈0.
(ii) Participatory Coupling: Degree of human interaction, modification, and creative
involvement. Devices that function as tools of learning or craftsmanship contribute
negatively to net external entropy, Ssoc
external < 0.
(iii) Feedback Integration:
Fraction of mechanical, informational, or environmental
noise reabsorbed through feedback loops. Endomarionettes that convert deformation
into proprioceptive data or training signals exhibit Sinfo
external ≤0.
13

The cumulative entropy balance
Sexternal = Smat
external + Ssoc
external + Sinfo
external
determines the applicable tax coeﬀicient:
τrobot = α max(0, Sexternal),
where α is a jurisdiction-specific normalization constant linking entropy units to fiscal cur-
rency.
Regulatory Implication.
Under this model, high-capital displacing automation (e.g.,
closed-source factory robotics, proprietary large-model infrastructures) would yield Sexternal >
0 and incur taxation proportional to their exported disorder.
Conversely, regenerative
automation—including soft endomarionettes, open-source prosthetics, and educational bio-
robots—would qualify for a zero or negative tax rate, receiving subsidies or credits for their
entropy-absorbing function.
This extension reframes fiscal policy as a thermodynamic feedback mechanism: taxation
becomes not punishment for progress, but a balancing operator ensuring that technological
evolution respects the RSVP condition of persistent coherence,
⟨H[Φ, v, S]⟩Ω≤0.
10
RSVP Interpretation of Enshittification
Cory Doctorow's concept of enshittification describes the progressive decay of online plat-
forms as they transition from being good for users, to good for advertisers, to good only for
themselves (?). Within the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, this dy-
namic can be modeled as a collapse of entropy coupling between three interacting fields: the
scalar field Φ (capacity or legitimacy), the vector field v (flow or activity), and the entropy
field S (disorder or extractive pressure). Enshittification represents the runaway phase of
this system in which local optimization of v for profit exceeds the capacity of Φ to reabsorb
disorder, causing a positive feedback in S.
Stage I: High Coupling, Low Entropy.
In the early phase of a platform's life, the
gradient ∇Φ between user needs and technical affordances drives a coherent flow v. The
entropy field S is minimized through open feedback loops—user complaints lead to fixes,
interoperability is permitted, and external APIs function as entropy sinks. The divergence
condition
∇· (Φv) + ∂S
∂t ≈0
is approximately satisfied: disorder exported through growth is rapidly reabsorbed through
repair and adaptation.
14

Stage II: Flow Dominance and Scalar Depletion.
As investor pressures increase, the
system begins maximizing ∥v∥(monetary flow, engagement rate) at the expense of Φ (user
capacity). Interoperability restrictions and enclosures raise ∂S/∂t > 0, while maintenance
and openness decline.
The entropy exported to the periphery—users, small developers,
moderators—no longer returns as feedback. The plenum becomes asymmetric: flows are
strong, but capacity and meaning weaken. This is the onset of informational debt.
Stage III: Entropic Inversion.
At the terminal stage, both users and advertisers become
trapped within a high-entropy attractor. Every new action—scrolling, posting, advertising—
feeds back as additional disorder, increasing S without increasing Φ. The platform consumes
its own informational coherence, transforming user creativity into noise and algorithmic
sludge. Formally:
dS
dt > 0,
dΦ
dt < 0,
v · ∇Φ ≤0.
The plenum's Hamiltonian H[Φ, v, S] becomes positive, violating the RSVP persistence con-
dition ⟨H⟩Ω≤0. At this point, collapse or regulation is inevitable.
Interoperability as Entropic Reabsorption.
Doctorow's proposed remedy—mandated
interoperability—can be expressed in RSVP terms as the restoration of vector permeability.
When data and users can flow freely between systems, v once again couples to Φ, allowing
the reabsorption of entropy through cross-platform feedback. Competition and modularity
act as negative entropy gradients that restore systemic coherence:
∂S
∂t = −λ ∇· (Φv),
where λ > 0 represents regulatory permeability.
Antitrust enforcement likewise flattens
excessive scalar asymmetries—preventing any single region of Φ from monopolizing capacity.
Physical World Analogy.
The same process applies to physical infrastructures that un-
dergo enshittification—appliances that demand logins, cars with remote locks, or supply
chains with opaque data brokers (?). Each instance reflects a reduction in local feedback
and an increase in informational latency: users can no longer repair or repurpose their own
tools. Entropy that once circulated within the ecosystem becomes trapped inside proprietary
enclosures, raising the system's free energy until failure.
RSVP Diagnosis.
From an RSVP perspective, enshittification is not moral decline but
thermodynamic imbalance. A platform or polity decays when its restorative operators R
(repair, user control, transparency) are suppressed relative to its creative operators (growth,
extraction, engagement). The cure is therefore not ideological but structural: restore feed-
back permeability, reinstate entropy sinks, and ensure that the divergence condition
⟨H[Φ, v, S] + R⟩Ω≤0
holds across the economic, informational, and epistemic layers of the system.
15

Integration with the Noise Tax.
In this light, the noise tax can be interpreted as a
formal mechanism for counteracting enshittification. By taxing the unrecirculated entropy
produced by attention economies and rewarding reabsorptive acts such as moderation, open

Enshittification is thus the fiscal signature of a system where this tax is zero; coherence
restoration begins the moment entropy costs are internalized again.
Bridge to Triadic Closure.
The enshittification of digital and physical systems under-
scores the urgency of integrating the robot tax, noise tax, and merit dividend into a unified
framework. Just as Sanders's robot tax addresses the economic fallout of automation and
endomarionettes exemplify entropy-absorbing technology, the noise tax counters the infor-
mational decay of enshittified platforms. Together, these mechanisms enforce the RSVP
principle of entropy reabsorption, setting the stage for a comprehensive conservation law
that ensures systemic coherence across all domains.

Triadic Closure: The Conservation of Coherence
The three fiscal operators developed throughout this paper—the robot tax, the noise tax,
and the merit dividend—represent orthogonal projections of a single conservation principle:
the preservation of coherence within the scalar-vector-entropy plenum. Each addresses a
distinct dimension of exported entropy:
Domain
Entropy Form
Corrective Operator
Economic (production)
Labor displacement, material waste
Robot tax
Informational (communication)
Semantic noise, cognitive overload
Noise tax
Epistemic (knowledge)
Credit extraction, unacknowledged inheritance
Merit dividend
These operators form a basis set for entropic accounting across civilization's three fun-
damental flows: energy, information, and meaning. Their sum defines the total restorative
operator R acting on the RSVP Hamiltonian:
R = Reconomic + Rinformational + Repistemic.
Unified invariant.
The global coherence condition is therefore:
⟨H[Φ, v, S] + R⟩Ω≤0,
ensuring that at every scale the entropic export of creation is counterbalanced by the reab-
sorption of restoration. The robot tax closes the loop on matter, the noise tax on signal,
and the merit dividend on understanding.

Geometric interpretation.
In informational geometry, these three operators correspond
to the orthogonal axes of RSVP space:
(Φ, v, S)
⇒
(capacity, flow, entropy).
The robot tax acts on vector flows (v), restraining extractive acceleration by taxing dis-
placement. The noise tax acts on scalar capacity (Φ), filtering low-information gradients to
preserve meaning. The merit dividend acts on entropy (S), restoring epistemic balance by
compensating the collective field. Together they enforce a closed divergence condition,
∇· (Φv) + ∂S
∂t = 0,
which expresses social sustainability as literal thermodynamic continuity. This orthogonality
ensures comprehensive coverage: capacity enables flow, flow generates entropy, and entropy
feedback stabilizes capacity.
A 3D axes diagram labeled Φ, v, S would show the projection of the three taxes as
perpendicular planes, illustrating how they intersect to form a balanced plenum.
Historical conservation laws in physics, from energy to information, inspire this general-
ization to ethics, where RSVP extends thermodynamic principles to civic coherence (?).
Ethical corollary.
A society that implements these three feedbacks ceases to confuse
growth with coherence.
Progress becomes the maintenance of reversible transformations
in which no form of order is extracted without another form being restored. This triadic
conservation law—economic, informational, epistemic—constitutes the fiscal expression of
the RSVP axiom:
Persistence requires reabsorption.
This satisfies ⟨H[Φ, v, S]⟩Ω≤0.

Conclusion: Civilization as Entropic Metabolism
Civilization endures only as long as it remains metabolically open to its own disorder. The
robot, noise, and merit taxes together formalize this principle in economic, informational,
and epistemic form. They remind us that progress without feedback is not progress but
leakage. Every system—biological, cognitive, or civilizational—that forgets to reabsorb the
entropy it exports begins to disintegrate under the weight of its own acceleration. To persist
is not to produce more, but to circulate more perfectly: to let what has been scattered
become structured again. In this sense, the highest act of intelligence is not creation but
maintenance—the quiet reconstitution of coherence from the ruins of excess. Reconnecting
to Sanders's moral tone, this calls for cultural imagination alongside fiscal reform, inviting
future empirical validation through pilot programs and entropy-balance metrics. To sustain
civilization is to master the art of reversible disorder.
