Research neural processing unit (NPU) architecture.

Got it — let's start systematically.
To "research NPU architecture," we should first decide
which level of depth and scope
you want to focus on, since "NPU" spans from high-level system integration down to microarchitecture.
Step 1 — Define Your Research Scope
Which of the following best describes your current goal?
A.
Understand general
NPU design principles
(overview for literature review or report)
B.
Compare
commercial NPUs
(e.g., Google TPU, Apple ANE, Tesla D1, Huawei Ascend)
C.
Explore
architectural techniques
(dataflows, MAC array design, sparsity, quantization)
D.
Design a
custom NPU
for a specific workload (e.g., Transformers, CNNs, recommendation)
E.
Study
compiler & software stack
co-design for NPUs
F.
Analyze
performance/energy modeling
and PPA trade-offs
You can choose multiple (e.g., "C + D") if you want both technical depth and practical design.
Once you choose, I'll guide you through:
Workload characterization
(e.g., model type, precision, batch size, latency/throughput targets)
Architectural exploration
(core design, dataflow, memory hierarchy, interconnect)
Performance/energy modeling
(roofline or analytical model)
System-level integration
(chiplet, interconnect, software stack)
