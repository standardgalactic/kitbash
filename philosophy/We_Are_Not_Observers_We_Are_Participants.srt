00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,060
Welcome to the Deep Dive. Our mission today is pretty ambitious. We are challenging one of the

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:16,060
most basic bedrock assumptions of, well, of all modern science and philosophy. The idea that we

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,820
are simply passive observers, that we're just looking at a fixed external universe. We've got

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,500
a dense stack of sources today, all diving into foundational physics, into philosophy. And what

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:35,560
they suggest is that reality might actually be, well, more of a negotiation. We're exploring

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,560
this framework known as the participatory universe in the realist mode. And the goal is to give

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:47,620
you a shortcut to understanding why accepting our role as participants fundamentally changes

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,700
everything. It changes how we think about knowledge, about measurement, about what reality even

9
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,700
is. Exactly. And the central concept that really forces this shift is something we call

10
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,780
interference. Interference. Yeah. And immediately that sounds like, you know, noise or just a

11
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,520
disturbance. But here it's something far more profound. It's the unavoidable inherent link

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,760
between a system's representation of its domain. So it's knowledge of the world. It's knowledge

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,200
of the world and its own actions within that domain. When that link is truly unavoidable,

14
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,460
it becomes, and I'm quoting here, impossible to stabilize certain features of the world as

15
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,540
objects of knowledge independently of the act of representing them.

16
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,120
You can't separate the map from the map maker's own movements.

17
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,000
You got it.

18
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,680
Okay. Let's unpack that because it sounds a little bit like we're back to philosophical tricks,

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,120
but these ideas come straight out of physics, out of computer science. So how is this different

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,440
from just having imperfect knowledge or, you know, accidentally disturbing something when you

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:58,340
measure it? That's the crucial question. Imperfect knowledge means the fact is there. It exists. We

22
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,780
just haven't found it yet. Right. Interference means the fact cannot be stabilized until the act of

23
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,360
measurement is complete. And that act itself helps determine the outcome. We can see this in a couple of

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,520
really clear ways. First, there's the logical, not the semantic example.

25
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,660
Ah, give us the self-defeating computer paradox. It's a great one.

26
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:26,300
It's the perfect illustration of what we call negative interference. So imagine you program a

27
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,600
computer to answer this very specific question. Is the answer to this question that's about to be

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
displayed in the output channel, no?

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,120
Okay. I see where this is going. Yeah. If the computer answers yes, it means the displayed

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,740
answer is no, which contradicts the yes it just gave. Right. And if the computer answers no,

31
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,380
then the displayed answer is no, which means the answer should have been yes. Yeah. It's a liar

32
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:56,520
either way. Exactly. Any answer it gives conflicts semantically with the action of giving the answer.

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,880
The computer literally cannot stabilize the truth of its statement independently of the output

34
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,020
channel it's using. It's trapped. Right. It's trapped by self-reference. And we see another

35
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:15,060
version of that in the everyday world, the causal example. This is less about logic and more about

36
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,300
actions defeating predictions. Yeah. The classic example is the boy trying to guess his Christmas

37
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,580
present. His mother is absolutely determined to surprise him. So she waits until Christmas Eve to

38
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:34,440
buy the gift. The boy's prediction, his guess, directly causes the mother to act to defeat that

39
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:41,160
prediction. So the prediction itself interferes with the reality it's trying to describe. The attempt to

40
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,160
know the future becomes self-defeating. It does. And we see echoes of this, you know, classically,

41
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,500
think about stock market predictions or political polls. The prediction itself makes people change their

42
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,380
behavior. But classically, we feel like we can mostly contain that. That's the key difference.

43
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,420
In a classical setting, this kind of self-referential interference is usually controlled. We can sort of

44
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,100
channel it and focus it into the future. Right. It affects what happens next. But we can all still

45
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,220
agree on what happened in the past or what's physically around us right now. But, and this is where it gets

46
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,120
really, really interesting. In quantum mechanics, interference is endemic. Endemic.

47
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,980
It's pervasive. It affects the stabilization of properties, even in the present moment.

48
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,860
And this means our fundamental attempts to find things out. Well, they don't have the logic of

49
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,380
measurement that we're used to. Right. Because we're all instinctive realists. We just assume

50
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,340
that when we measure the spin of a particle, we're just revealing a value that was already there.

51
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,640
Like, you know, reading a label off a jar. Precisely. We assume measurement reveals what

52
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:53,800
was there already or there anyways. But decades of foundational physics Bell's theorems, the study

53
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:01,540
of decoherence, they all show that we have to deny that assumption. So unmeasured quantum properties just

54
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:07,840
don't have definite values. They don't. The act of interaction fundamentally prevents us from stabilizing

55
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,740
the properties of that system independently of our attempt to know them.

56
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:18,180
So we can't treat the microscopic world as there to be known in the same way the future isn't there

57
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:25,320
to be known. So if we can't stabilize these systems as objective objects, we had to change our whole

58
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,700
philosophical attitude. We have to. We have to shift from the position of the detached observer to the

59
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:36,300
participant. The observer assumes they are separate, standing outside the system. The participant

60
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,980
recognizes they are part of the unfolding reality. Which means we have to reframe the interaction

61
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:49,140
itself. We should see quantum events not as passive measurements, but as, as choices.

62
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:56,360
Ah. Strategic actions. Exactly. I mean, think about it. A choice produces an action that interferes with

63
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,320
what happens next. It's like planting seeds in the spring to get a crop in the fall. You're intervening to

64
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,000
get a result. You're intervening. If you treat the quantum interaction as a knowledge gathering

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,300
game, you run into all this paradoxical interference. But if you treat it as a strategic action, the

66
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:20,000
interference is just. Well, that's the nature of being embedded in the system. This connects beautifully

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,940
to John Wheeler's idea of observer participancy. But you're not making it subjective. You're placing it

68
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:33,080
inside a concrete objective account of physics. That's right. The ability that classical physics

69
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,600
gave us, this, this luxury of separating observation from participation, of treating the world as a pure

70
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,460
object of epistemic attention. Of just looking. Of just looking. Yes. That's revealed to be the special

71
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,400
case, not the generic one. It's a simplifying condition that emerges only under certain circumstances.

72
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,720
We are constantly acting in the environment we're representing. And because of that, the information

73
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:06,420
we get back will always contain the ripples produced by its own actions. That's a huge shift in perspective.

74
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:14,680
Yeah. But now we have to go from epistemology, how we know things, to ontology, to what things are.

75
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,520
If reality is this inseparable process, what does that mean for how we figure out the fundamental

76
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,600
building blocks of the universe? This takes us right to the concept of simplicity.

77
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,000
Simplicity. In physics, simplicity isn't just about, you know, pretty equations. It's a

78
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,960
crucial guide for model building, for figuring out what's fundamental. And you measure it by minimizing

79
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,240
the number of degrees of freedom. The fewest independently moving parts, you need to explain everything you see.

80
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,600
That's it. This is what Einstein meant when he said the goal of theory is to make the irreducible

81
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,440
basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation

82
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,460
of a single datum of experience. Simplicity guides us to truth.

83
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:06,360
And when we apply that drive to quantum reality, we immediately slam into its strangest feature.

84
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:15,060
Entanglement, non-separability. These are states that posit non-identical but perfectly correlated

85
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:22,700
events. So particle A and particle B are separated by a galaxy. Yet if A is measured spin up, B is

86
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,160
instantaneously spin down every single time.

87
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:34,200
And you see these deep instantaneous constraints across vast distances. So what is the rational

88
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,300
scientific response to a correlation that extreme?

89
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,840
You apply the common source principle. If you see correlated results, the most rational inference

90
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:48,760
is to trace them back to a common source or a common ground. It is always simpler to assume a shared

91
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,000
origin than to just invent some spooky, unexplained connection between two distant things.

92
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,220
So because the entangled events are correlated, but are demonstrably not connected by any known

93
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,820
signal in 3D space, the interpretive pressure is to see the parts not as independent things at all.

94
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,680
Exactly. But as being grounded in the whole integrated entangled system, this is quantum holism.

95
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,380
The whole is more fundamental than the parts.

96
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,140
Okay, there's great analogy for this.

97
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:23,700
Yes, Bohm's fish tank. It visualizes this perfectly. Imagine you're watching two TV screens.

98
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,900
Each screen shows the movement of a fish.

99
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,760
Okay, two different images of fish.

100
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,040
And you observe that when the fish on screen one turns left, the fish on screen two instantly turns

101
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:43,080
right. They're perfectly instantaneously correlated, but you see no signal, no wire passing between the

102
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,480
screens.

103
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,080
So if you were a 2D being living only on the plane of the screens, you'd have to invent some incredibly

104
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,400
complicated theory. So kind of instantaneous communication between the two images.

105
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,880
You would. But we, with our 3D perspective, we know the true source of the correlation.

106
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:06,320
The two images are just different lower dimensional projections of a single physical 3D fish swimming

107
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,900
in the tank.

108
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,300
Ah.

109
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,400
The correlation isn't due to signals in the 2D space. It's just redundancy. It comes from the common

110
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,520
source, the single beebable fish.

111
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,680
That's a perfect metaphor for holism. The weird correlation in the 2D measurement space

112
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,920
is explained most simply by a single higher dimensional reality, the integrated system,

113
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,180
which is the truly fundamental thing.

114
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,320
And that's the argument. For those who favor quantum holism, the simplicity requirement leaves

115
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,000
them to say the fundamental ontology shouldn't be tiny independent particles, but maybe the entire

116
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,480
cosmos, or the holistic wave function in some higher dimensional space. It's the simplest explanation

117
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,920
for the coordinated randomness we see.

118
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,960
This all paints a picture of a world that is fundamentally inseparable, participatory. But if that's what's really

119
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:03,880
going on, how do we explain this? Our everyday experience, the stability, the separability, the objectivity

120
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,700
of everything. Why is my coffee mug always in the same place?

121
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,100
We get back to the process that, in a way, saves classical reality. Decoherence.

122
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,860
Decoherence.

123
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,080
Decoherence is a physical mechanism that actively suppresses quantum interference. You can think of it

124
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,520
as the universe smoothing out its own weirdness. When a quantum system interacts with a complex,

125
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,300
noisy, thermal environment.

126
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,940
The billions of air particles all around my mug.

127
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,220
Exactly. The fragile superpositions, the quantumness, it quickly leaks into that environment

128
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,160
and gets scrambled.

129
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,940
So the environment itself is acting like a chaotic, incredibly fast measuring device that

130
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,080
just destroys the possibility of interference.

131
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,220
That's a great way to put it. And this provides the physical mechanism for the emergence of the

132
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,060
classical world, the world of stable knowers and objective objects. Our everyday perceptual

133
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,560
interactions happen in an environment where interference has been washed out, allowing stability to become

134
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
the rule, not the exception.

135
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,640
And this brings us to that strange tension we all feel about time. On one hand, you have

136
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:18,160
the fixed mathematical structure of time and physics, what philosophers call Parmenidian time.

137
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,860
The block universe, where the past, present, and future are all equally real.

138
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,520
The map.

139
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:30,080
The map. But then we have our subjective, lived experience, Heraclitian time. The feeling of flow,

140
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,940
of passage, of an open future. This really sounds like confusing the map with the territory.

141
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,320
It is absolutely confusing the map with the territory.

142
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,940
The mathematical block universe is an effective description of all possible events,

143
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,940
but it isn't the experience of those events. Our subjective experience of flow and passage

144
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:55,300
emerges entirely from our perspective as, well, as temporally embedded momentary participants.

145
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,140
We're inside it. Moving through it.

146
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,620
We're inside it. The feeling of the future being open arises because you, the participant,

147
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,560
cannot stabilize your beliefs or your knowledge about the future until you have stabilized your choices.

148
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,060
And because your choice is an action that interferes with the outcome,

149
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:19,240
the future remains genuinely open to you, even if the underlying physical laws are deterministic.

150
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:26,380
So the flow and the passage that we feel, they aren't intrinsic properties of the universe itself.

151
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,780
They are, and I'm quoting again, artifacts of changes in the participant's perspective

152
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,060
relative to the fixed physical background.

153
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,900
It's an emergent feature of being an agent inside the process.

154
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:46,120
And that is the synthesis. The stability, separability, and objectivity we take for granted in classical physics

155
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,280
are not generic features of the cosmos. They are emergent special conditions achieved through decoherence.

156
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,760
And at the deepest level...

157
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,260
Deepest level, the very structure that supports the distinction between self as subject and world as object just,

158
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,660
it disappears. It reveals an underlying inescapable inseparability.

159
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:12,300
This is genuinely profound. We've moved from the philosophical problem of self-reference interference

160
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,580
to the ontological problem of fundamental structure, simplicity and holism,

161
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,620
and then finally to the subjective problem of experience, this emergent time and flow.

162
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,640
The ultimate takeaway for you here is that the quantum world isn't unknowable

163
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,920
because it's cloaked in some kind of mysticism.

164
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,460
It's unknowable in the classical sense for the very same reason the future is unknowable in the classical sense

165
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,760
because our actions are an inherent interfering part of the unfolding reality.

166
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,040
We aren't just in the audience. We are actors on the stage.

167
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,700
And if we really accept that view, if we start looking at the quantum world not through the logic of passive measurement

168
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,520
but through the logic of strategy and active choice, it raises an extraordinary final question for you to mull over.

169
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,420
What does that participatory structure imply about the nature of free will,

170
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:08,040
given that our ability to act strategically is itself an emergent feature of what is, at its base,

171
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,320
a deterministic physical universe?

172
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,460
It suggests genuine uncertainty can arise from an internal perspective,

173
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,780
even while the clockwork of the cosmos just keeps on turning.

174
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,340
Oh, no.

175
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,260
There we go.

176
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,560
Thank you.

177
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:19,660
Woo-hoo.

178
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,400
Thank you.

179
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,380
And then,

180
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,420
where is your religion?

181
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,800
Buying!

182
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,560
No,

183
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:43,620
no!

184
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,060
No,

185
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,720
no.
