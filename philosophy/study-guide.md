# **Quiz: Short-Answer Questions**

**Instructions:** Answer each question in **2–3 sentences**, drawing exclusively on the information from the source material.

1. What is "Interference" as defined in the source, and how does its manifestation differ between classical and quantum mechanics?
2. Why are quantum "measurements" better reconceived as choices rather than as acts of knowledge gathering?
3. Explain the concept of a "common ground explanation" and how it is proposed as a solution to the mystery of quantum nonseparability.
4. According to the source, what role does simplicity, as measured by the number of degrees of freedom, play in scientific model-building?
5. What specific type of symmetry signals the presence of "superfluous theoretical structure," and why are other types of symmetries not definitive indicators?
6. How does the provided analysis reformulate Curie’s Principle, and what is the key distinction between "characteristic" and "idiosyncratic" symmetries?
7. What is the primary logical problem with applying global postulates, like the Past Hypothesis, to explain the thermodynamic behavior of local subsystems?
8. What is the "Blind Spot" in science, and what are its purported negative consequences?
9. How does the concept of the "Temporally Evolving Point of View" (TEvPoV) explain the subjective experience of time’s passage and openness?
10. In an Everett (Many-Worlds) Universe, what is the proposed interpretation for Born probabilities, given that there is no genuine pre-measurement uncertainty?

# **Answer Key**

1. **Interference** arises when a system representing a domain also acts within it, preventing stabilization of domain facts independently of the act of representation. In classical mechanics, interference is channeled into the future; in quantum mechanics, it is pervasive and unavoidable.
2. Quantum “measurements” are better seen as **choices** because they lack the classical feature of revealing pre-existing properties. No-go theorems show measurement outcomes are produced by the interaction itself, making measurements acts of agency rather than knowledge-gathering.
3. A **common ground explanation** infers a shared metaphysical basis from modal connections between entities. It explains quantum nonseparability by treating entangled particles as manifestations of a unified underlying reality rather than separate objects linked causally.
4. **Simplicity**—minimizing degrees of freedom—guides theorists to construct the most economical model capable of reproducing observed phenomena. This follows epistemic conservatism: postulate only the structure required by the entities’ freedom of movement.
5. The key indicator of superfluous theoretical structure is a **qualitative-structure-preserving symmetry of the laws**. Other symmetries may relate physically distinct worlds or act only as internal automorphisms, so they do not reliably track surplus structure.
6. The analysis reformulates Curie’s Principle so that all **characteristic symmetries** of a Curie-cause must also be characteristic symmetries of its effect. Characteristic symmetries apply to all specifications; idiosyncratic symmetries apply only to specific one-off cases.
7. The global Past Hypothesis does not entail that **local subsystems** will also exhibit thermodynamic behavior. A universe-wide entropy increase does not logically ensure that subsystem trajectories similarly increase entropy, leaving an explanatory gap.
8. The **Blind Spot** is science’s abstraction away from lived human experience in pursuit of an objective worldview. This omission is implicated in conceptual problems involving time and quantum mechanics and in broader social crises of meaning and environmental harm.
9. The **TEvPoV** is constructed by sequencing momentary perspectives (TEMPs) across a lifetime. Passage arises from the evolution of this situated viewpoint; openness of the future arises because no beliefs about future outcomes can be stabilized until a choice is made.
10. In an **Everett Universe**, all outcomes occur, so there is no pre-measurement uncertainty. Born probabilities measure the **degree of surprise** or how typical a post-measurement observer is among all counterparts sharing the same pre-measurement history.

# **Essay Questions**

**Instructions:** These questions require extended, essay-style responses synthesizing multiple concepts.

1. Elaborate on the concept of a **participatory universe**. Compare and contrast how Interference manifests in classical vs. quantum mechanics, and explain how this difference supports the idea that the agentive perspective is fundamental in quantum theory.
2. Detail the argument for **quantum holism**. Explain Causal Inference and Grounding Inference, why Bell’s Theorem rules out classical common-cause explanations, and how a common-ground explanation offers a holistic alternative.
3. Discuss the relationship between **simplicity, symmetry, and fundamental ontology**. How does minimizing degrees of freedom guide theory development? How do qualitative-structure-preserving symmetries identify superfluous structure?
4. Analyze the critique of the **Boltzmannian account of thermodynamics**. Explain the tension between global and local postulates, the distinction between epistemic vs. statistical probabilities, and the proposed dynamical mechanisms that could fill the explanatory gap.
5. Synthesize the concepts of the **Blind Spot** and the **Temporally Evolving Point of View (TEvPoV)**. Explain how our subjective experience of flow and openness can emerge from within a block-universe ontology.
