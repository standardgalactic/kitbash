# **The Insufficiency of Global Postulates in Boltzmannian Thermodynamics: An Argument for Localization**

## **Introduction: Reassessing the Foundations of Statistical Mechanics**

The Boltzmannian project in statistical mechanics represents a seminal effort to ground the empirical laws of phenomenological thermodynamics in the more fundamental principles of microphysics. The strategic importance of this endeavor for a unified physical worldview can hardly be overstated; its sole ambition is to derive the macroscopic regularities we observe as consequences of microscopic particle dynamics, and it is against this ambition that its success or failure must be judged. However, the standard formulation of this account, I will argue, is built upon a flawed foundation that fatally undermines its explanatory power.

This paper's central thesis is that the standard Boltzmannian formulation, by applying its statistical postulates at the **global level of the universe as a whole**, is fundamentally unable to provide a satisfactory mechanical explanation for the **local** thermodynamic phenomena it seeks to explain. Its conclusions commit a category error, offering a modal or statistical explanation where a mechanical one is required, and in so doing render its core statistical postulate explanatorily impotent for the task at hand.

To substantiate this claim, this paper proceeds in three stages.

1. I outline the standard global account, exposing the theoretical machinery erected for its explanatory purpose.
2. I deconstruct its explanatory logic by dissecting two critical flaws concerning its relevance and its explanatory reach.
3. I advocate for a revised framework in which the statistical postulates are applied **locally**, directly to subsystems.

This analysis begins with a clear exposition of the standard global account.

## **1. The Standard Boltzmannian Account: A Global Formulation**

To effectively critique the global Boltzmannian account, it is first necessary to define the architecture it erects for its explanatory purpose. The account seeks to derive the macroscopic regularities of thermodynamics—most notably the Second Law—from a microscopic theory of particle motion. As formulated by David Albert, the architecture consists of three core postulates:

1. **The Laws of Motion:** The universe’s constituent particles obey Newtonian laws of motion.
2. **The Past Hypothesis (PH):** The universe began in a specific, cosmically low-entropy macrostate.
3. **The Statistical Postulate (SP):** There is a uniform probability distribution over the microstates compatible with the initial low-entropy macrostate defined by the Past Hypothesis.

Crucially, these postulates are applied at the **global** level; they concern the universe as a whole. The primary conclusion is probabilistic: *the most probable history of the universe is one in which entropy rises.*

The following analysis treats statistical mechanics strictly as a **mechanical theory** about physical facts—particle motions, local interactions, and causal processes—not as a theory about belief, credence, or epistemic probability.

## **2. A Critique of the Global Approach: Two Fundamental Problems**

The persuasive force of the argument against the global formulation rests on a rigorous deconstruction of its explanatory logic. The global application of SP introduces fatal flaws. Two problems are central:

### **2.1. The Problem of Extrinsic Probability: Why “Most Probable” Is Not Enough**

The central conclusion of the global account—that an entropy-increasing history is “most probable”—commits a **category error**.

The dilemma:

* **Either** thermodynamic generalizations hold true in *our world*, **or** they do not.
* If they do, it is because of the specific physical facts—laws and initial conditions—**in our universe**.
* If they do not, then their holding in “most possible worlds” is irrelevant.

The global SP provides *modal* information about an ensemble of possible universes. But:

> “What goes on at other worlds plays no role in the production of thermodynamic behavior at our world.”

Thus the SP, applied globally, is explanatorily impotent. It explains nothing about the actual mechanical processes in our universe.

A clarifying analogy:
Explaining why a specific child died by citing village-level mortality rates offers *no mechanical explanation*. Once actual physical facts are known (illness, injury, congenital defect), the statistical fact becomes irrelevant. Likewise, the universe’s mechanical evolution—not modal facts about possible universes—must explain thermodynamics.

### **2.2. The Problem of Scale: The Logical Gap Between the Universe and the Laboratory**

The second flaw concerns **scale**. Thermodynamics concerns **local subsystems**:

* gases in containers
* ice melting in water
* cream mixing into coffee

But the global postulates only show that **the universe’s total entropy** is likely to increase.

A universe-level trajectory does not entail subsystem-level behavior.

Analogy:
A train moving south may contain passengers walking north.
Likewise, a universe with increasing total entropy may contain local subsystems whose entropy decreases.

Without a mechanism connecting global postulates to local behavior, the global account fails to explain the very systems thermodynamics is about.

---

## **3. A Revised Framework: Localizing the Statistical Postulate**

The solution is to **localize** the Statistical Postulate.

Instead of applying the SP to the entire universe, we apply it to **ensembles of real-world subsystems**. The local SP is no longer a metaphysical claim about an ensemble of possible universes, but an empirically testable statistical regularity:

> For any sufficiently large, arbitrarily selected ensemble of real thermodynamic systems in a given macrostate, the microstates are distributed so that evolution toward equilibrium is overwhelmingly favored.

This approach:

* avoids the irrelevance of modal probability
* avoids the scale mismatch
* directly addresses the systems thermodynamics studies
* aligns with traditions from Reichenbach, Winsberg, Frigg, and Callender

Localizing the SP removes the conceptual failures of the global formulation and replaces them with a physically intelligible explanatory project.

However, this revision raises a new question.

## **4. The New Explanatory Lacuna: Why Does the Local Postulate Hold?**

Localizing the SP is not a final solution but a **more productive starting point**.

The new explanatory challenge:

> Why does the local SP hold with such extraordinary reliability across countless, apparently independent subsystems?

A mere stipulation (e.g., “that’s just how thermodynamic systems behave”) would be unsatisfying. Instead, we look for **mechanisms**.

Two broad classes of mechanisms appear promising:

### **Internal Mixing Mechanisms**

Example: the **Shuffling Hypothesis**

* Processes internal to each subsystem—such as GRW collapse events—“shuffle” microstates
* This maintains the stable microstate frequencies required for the local SP

### **External Mixing Mechanisms**

Example: the **Leeds proposal**

* Environmental perturbations constantly agitate local subsystems
* From the subsystem’s perspective, this resembles randomizing noise
* This drives the system toward stable SP-compatible behavior

Both approaches identify **concrete physical processes**, transforming the foundational puzzle from a metaphysical issue into a scientifically tractable question about dynamics.

This is the key advantage of localization:
it converts a conceptual impossibility into an empirical research program.

## **5. Conclusion**

The standard global formulation of Boltzmannian statistical mechanics is insufficient. The global Statistical Postulate is:

* **modally irrelevant** (our world’s behavior is not explained by possible worlds)
* **too coarse-grained** (it fails to connect universe-level claims to subsystem-level behavior)

As such, it cannot fulfill its ambition of providing a purely mechanical explanation of thermodynamic phenomena.

The proposed solution—a **localized Statistical Postulate**—grounds thermodynamics in empirically meaningful, physically relevant facts about real subsystems. This revision:

* resolves the problems of relevance and scale
* replaces a flawed modal framework with a concrete dynamical one
* poses a new but solvable explanatory challenge: identifying the physical mechanisms enforcing local SP regularities

Localization therefore marks a paradigm shift:
from metaphysical speculation to physical explanation.

It reframes statistical mechanics on more solid and intelligible foundations, directing us toward the concrete dynamical processes that produce the thermodynamic regularities observed throughout the world.
