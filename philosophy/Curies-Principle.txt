CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 
ABSTRACT. A reading is given of Curie's Principle that the symmetry of a cause is always 
preserved its effects. The truth of the principle is demonstrated and its importance, under 
the proposed reading, is defended. 
"As far as I see, 
all a priori 
statements 
in physics 
have 
their origin 
in symmetry." 
(Weyl, Symmetry, p. 126) 
1. 
INTRODUCTION1 
In 1894 Pierre Curie published a paper in which he stated the principle 
that the symmetry 
of a cause 
is always 
preserved 
in its effects. 
The proof 
of the principle 
is simple, 
yet far from 
being 
recognized 
as an important 
mathematical 
truth with 
wide-ranging 
applications 
in physics, 
when 
it 
receives 
any discussion 
at all, it is either dismissed 
out of hand or allotted 
the status of a mere methodological 
guide. Even as a methodological 
guide 
it is alleged 
to apply only 
in deterministic 
contexts, 
and hence 
to hold 
little 
interest for today's physics. 
Here 
are some pronouncements 
that are typical 
of the literature. 
Apart from being logically incorrect, [Curie's Principle] is in obvious contradiction with 
empirical evidence. (Radicati 1987, 202) 
What 
is to be 
said 
of 
this 
fundamental, 
profound 
principle 
that an asymmetry 
can 
only 
come 
from 
an asymmetry? 
The 
first reply 
is that qua general 
principle 
it is most 
likely 
false 
and certainly untenable, (van Fraassen 1989, 240) 
Curie's putative principle (even in my formulation, which did not use causal terms) has no 
fundamental ontological status ... it betokens only a thirst for hidden variables, for hidden 
structure 
that will 
explain, 
will 
answer 
why? 
- 
and nature may 
simply 
reject 
the question, 
(van Fraassen 1991, 24) 
Grounds 
given 
for rejecting 
the principle 
are typically 
one or more 
of 
the following: 
(i) the principle 
purports 
to be a priori 
but actually 
rules on an empirical 
question;

JENANN ISMAEL 
(ii) the principle 
is simply 
false, 
since 
nowadays 
physicists 
recognize 
many 
phenomena 
which 
spontaneously 
break 
the symmetry 
of the 
preceding 
conditions; 
(iii) the principle 
- 
even 
if it is true for deterministic 
theories - 
has no 
application 
in indeterministic 
contexts; 
and finally, 
(iv) the principle, 
if interpreted 
in such a way 
as to make 
it true, is empty. 
I will 
argue contra 
omnes murmurantes: 
(i) that the principle, 
properly 
understood, 
is necessarily 
true; 
(ii) that instances 
of (so-called) 
'spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking' 
are not 
counterexamples 
to it; 
(iii) that even 
in the context 
of indeterminism, 
it remains 
a powerful 
heuris 
tic; and finally, 
(iv) that it has important 
and far-reaching 
consequences 
in physics 
and in 
the philosophy 
of science 
quite generally. 
Recognizing 
the truth of the principle 
requires properly 
understanding 
it, and 
this 
in turn requires 
appreciating 
Curie's 
basic 
insight 
into the 
physical 
significance 
of the symmetries 
of a set of 
laws and the states 
they relate. 
It is an insight well 
worth 
appreciating, 
for the physical 
and 
philosophical 
rewards 
are great, 
and some 
of these will 
be 
indicated 
in 
what 
follows. 
Let's 
turn to the principle 
to see what 
all of the fuss is about. 
2. 
THE PRINCIPLE 
A physical 
theory specifies what 
sorts of objects 
there are and how they are 
related 
to one another, 
so theories 
in physics 
? at least in part 
? describe 
structures. 
Any 
structure uniquely 
determines 
a group 
of transformations 
called 
its symmetry 
group, 
and the study of such groups 
is the mathe 
matical 
theory of symmetry. 
It is a particularly 
elegant 
theory 
in that the 
physically 
interesting 
relations 
between 
structures 
receive 
an exceedingly 
simple 
expression 
in terms of relations 
between 
their symmetry 
groups, 
and all of the important 
particular 
truths about 
structures 
can be derived 
from simple principles 
relating 
their symmetries. 
Curie's 
Principle 
is such 
a principle. 
Curie 
states 
it several 
times 
in his paper departing 
little from 
the formulation 
given 
in the first paragraph: 
When 
certain 
effects 
show 
a certain 
asymmetry, 
this asymmetry 
must 
be found 
in the causes 
which gave rise to them. (Curie 1894, 401) 

CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 
169 
What 
the principle 
says depends 
crucially 
on how 
the terms 
'cause' 
and 
'effect' 
are understood, 
so bear with me 
through 
the definitions; 
exeget 
ical support 
for the reading will 
be given 
in Section 
9. Let A and B 
be 
families 
{A\,Ai...} 
and {B\,Bi...} 
respectively, 
of mutually 
exclu 
sive and jointly 
exhaustive 
event 
types, 
and let the statement 
that A 
is a 
Curie-cause 
and B 
its Curie-effect 
mean 
that the physical 
laws provide 
a 
many-one 
mapping 
of A 
into B, 
or - more 
simply 
- 
that (relative 
to the 
laws) A determines B? A and B may be different aspects of the total state 
of one system 
at a single 
time, or total states of a system 
at two different 
times. Curie-causes 
(and effects) 
relate 
to their specifications 
as physical 
quantities 
relate to their values. 
Consider, 
for example, 
the Boyle-Charles 
law relating 
the pressure 
and volume 
of an ideal gas to its temperature: 
PV 
? 
kT. The product 
of the pressure 
and volume 
is, in this instance, 
the Curie-cause, 
the temperature 
is its Curie-effect, 
and particular 
values 
of the two which 
satisfy 
the laws are specifications 
of the same. 
Simi 
larly, consider 
the state of an isolated Newtonian 
system 
at two different 
times. The Newtonian 
dynamical 
laws are deterministic, 
so the prior state 
is the Curie-cause, 
the later one 
is its effect, 
and pairs of particular 
states 
which 
satisfy 
the equations 
are specifications. 
In what 
follows, 
I will 
use 
subscripts 
to distinguish 
Curie-causes 
and effects 
from 
specifications, 
so 
(A, B) will 
denote 
a Curie-cause 
and -effect, whereas 
(A?, J5?) will 
denote 
one of its specifications. 
Now, 
let us call the symmetries 
common 
to all specifications 
of some 
Curie-cause 
its characteristic 
symmetries, 
and let us call idiosyncratic 
those 
transformations 
that are symmetries 
of some but not all specifications. 
In 
the case of the Boyle-Charles 
law above, 
transformations 
under which 
all 
specifications 
of the values 
of pressure 
and volume 
are invariant, e.g., spa 
tial reflections 
or permutations 
of the value 
of some unrelated 
parameter, 
are characteristic 
symmetries 
of the Curie-cause. 
By contrast, 
transforma 
tions under which 
only 
some specifications 
are invariant, are idiosyncratic 
symmetries 
of those specifications. 
Exchange 
of the values 
of temperature 
and pressure 
(in standard units), 
for example, 
is an idiosyncratic 
symme 
try only of states for which 
the two happen 
to be equal. Likewise, 
in the 
case of the Newtonian 
dynamical 
laws, 
transformations 
under which 
all 
states are invariant, 
e.g., 
simple 
spatial displacements, 
are characteristic 
symmetries 
of the Curie-cause, 
whereas 
transformations 
under which 
only 
some states are invariant, e.g., exchange 
of values 
of mass 
and acceleration, 
are idiosyncratic 
symmetries 
of those 
states. 
I propose 
that we 
interpret 
'cause' 
and 
'effect' 
in Curie's 
statement 
of his principle 
as Curie-cause 
and Curie-effect. 
The content 
of the principle, 
then, is that 

170 
JENANN ISMAEL 
all characteristic 
symmetries 
of a Curie-cause 
are also 
characteristic 
symmetries 
of 
its 
effect. 
Equivalently, 
if T is an idiosyncractic asymmetry of any specification of a Curie-effect, then it is also an 
idiosyncratic 
asymmetry 
of some 
specification 
of the corresponding 
Curie-cause.3 
3. 
THE PROOF 
The proof of the principle follows almost immediately from the definitions 
in the preceding 
section. 
The 
laws of a deterministic 
theory 
enable 
the 
Curie-effect 
B 
to be derived 
from the cause A, 
and can be represented 
as 
a mapping 
of the set of possible 
specifications 
of A 
into the set of possible 
specifications 
of B, 
equivalent 
to a set (usually 
infinite) 
of ordered 
pairs 
(Ai, Bi) where each (Au Bi) is a solution to the laws. If (Ai, Bi) is such 
a pair and T 
is a transformation 
which 
acts on A 
and B, 
then T 
takes 
(Ai, Bi) 
onto 
(TAi, TBi). 
Now, 
suppose Curie's 
principle 
isn't true. Then 
there is some T, and some pair of solutions 
of the laws (Ai, Bi) 
and (TAi, 
TBi) such that TAj = Aj but TBj ^ Bj.4 But the laws are deterministic, 
so any Curie-cause 
has only one physically 
possible 
effect 
among 
the B's 
and it follows 
? 
contrary 
to the hypothesis 
? that TBj 
= Bj, 
and Curie's 
Principle 
is true after all. If A is a Curie-cause 
of B and T 
is a characteristic 
symmetry 
of A (i.e. if it acts as the identity on each specification 
Ai of A), 
it had better act as the identity on each Bi 
as well. 
Let me emphasize 
that the asymmetries 
in question 
are characteristic; 
T 
is a characteristic 
symmetry 
of A iff it is a symmetry 
of each of the Ai 
's (i.e., 
?^for all Ai, (TAi = Ai)), and it is a characteristic symmetry of B iff it is a 
symmetry 
of each of the Bi's. 
If this is not kept in mind, 
there is a temptation 
to think that cases 
like the following 
provide 
counterexamples: 
consider 
a world 
consisting 
of two types of particle, 
bald and hairy, governed 
by 
deterministic 
dynamical 
laws which 
prescribe 
that all hairy particles 
decay 
into bald 
ones, 
but bald ones 
never 
decay 
into hairy 
ones. 
Take 
as the 
Curie-cause 
partial 
state-descriptions 
of the form 
( # of hairy particles present, # of bald particles present) 
and consider 
the transformation 
T that replaces 
all bald particles with 
hairy 
ones and hairy particles 
with 
bald ones 
T 
: (ra,n) 
-? 
(n,m). 

CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 
171 
Now, 
the state description 
A\ 
= 
(3,3) 
nomologically 
determines 
B\ 
= 
(0,6), 
and T 
is a symmetry 
of A but not a symmetry 
of J3.5 This 
is correct, 
but it does not constitute 
a counterexample 
to Curie's 
Principle 
because 
T 
is not a characteristic 
symmetry 
of A, 
it is merely 
an idiosyncratic 
symmetry 
of A\. 
The Ai 
's are essentially 
ordered 
pairs, for they are not all 
invariant under 
exchange 
of bald and hairy particles; 
having 
6 bald and 0 
hairy particles 
is quite different 
from having 
0 bald and 6 hairy ones. 
It may 
still seem that I have pulled 
a rabbit out of a hat: I have purported 
to show that it is impossible 
to write 
down 
a set of deterministic 
equations 
that carries 
the state of a system 
characterized 
by certain 
characteristic 
symmetries 
onto a state that lacks those symmetries. 
Even 
if this is plausible 
enough with 
respect 
to non-geometric 
transforamtions 
like the one above, 
one might 
expect 
geometric 
transformations 
to provide 
counterexamples. 
For 
the sake of uniformity 
in talking 
about 
geometric 
transformations, 
and for reasons 
that will 
be given 
in Section 
4, I will 
restrict 
attention 
to the generally 
covariant 
formulations 
of theories 
and I will 
assume 
that 
the transformations 
in question 
are manifold 
automorphisms, 
i.e. one-one 
suitably 
continuous 
and differentiable 
mappings 
of a manifold 
M 
into M. 
A 
system 
of equations 
is covariant 
under 
a transformation 
T just in case 
for any (A, B) that is a model of the equations, (TA, TB) 
is a model 
as well; 
and a system 
of equations 
is generally 
covariant 
just in case 
it is 
covariant 
under 
arbitrary manifold 
automorphisms.6 
No 
generality 
is lost 
because 
all theories 
can be given a generally 
covariant 
formulation 
and any 
transformation 
can be represented 
as a manifold 
automorphism.7 
Now, 
imagine 
a universe which 
exists for exactly 
a minute 
and consists 
of a sphere which 
gradually 
deforms 
into an ellipse; 
surely 
it is possible 
to write 
down 
a deterministic 
equation 
describing 
the evolution 
of the 
sphere. 
Try 
to do 
it, however, 
and you will 
find 
that you will 
need 
to 
include 
a parameter 
which 
takes different 
values 
for different 
directions 
in 
space, 
i.e. a parameter 
whose 
value 
is not invariant under arbitrary 
spatial 
rotations. You will 
need 
to do so because 
you will 
need 
to distinguish 
the 
direction 
along which 
the sphere elongates. 
This 
is precisely 
to recognize 
a 
characteristic 
asymmetry 
in the Curie-cause 
of the elongation 
of the sphere. 
Nothing 
very mysterious 
is going 
on here: 
if A 
is the Curie-cause 
of B, 
then A nomologically 
determines 
B. This means 
that there is a many-one 
mapping 
from 
the set of specifications 
of A 
into the set of specifications 
of 
B, 
so different 
BiS 
always 
(i.e. in all physically 
possible 
worlds) 
'come 
from' 
different 
A?'s. 
From 
this it follows 
straight-away 
that the intrinsic 
asymmetries 
of B 
are also 
intrinsic asymmetries 
of A.8

INTERPRETATION OF THE PRINCIPLE 
Let me 
spell 
this out 
in a way 
that brings 
out the physical 
significance 
of the symmetries 
of a set of equations: 
instead 
of thinking 
of them as 
automorphisms 
of the set of solutions, 
we 
should 
think of them as the set 
of transformations 
among 
the values 
of relevant parameters 
which 
preserve 
their truth. The 
symmetries 
of a set of equations 
determining 
one among 
a 
family B of alternatives, 
then, correspond 
physically 
to either 
(i) permutations 
of the values 
of i?-irrelevant 
parameters, 
or 
(ii) irrelevant permutations 
of 5-relevant 
parameters, 
i.e. transformations 
which 
either map 
them onto 
themselves 
or are accompanied 
by com 
pensating 
transformations 
in the values 
of other parameters 
in such a 
way 
as to preserve 
the relation 
described 
by the law. 
The key 
to understanding 
Curie's 
Principle 
is to focus 
on the contra 
positive; 
transformations 
which 
aren 
't symmetries 
correspond 
physical 
ly to relevant 
permutations 
of the values 
of relevant 
parameters. 
This 
is 
easy 
to see 
in the case of non-geometric 
asymmetries, 
since 
these 
cor 
respond 
to the transformations 
of values 
of parameters 
in the equation 
expressing 
the laws in question, 
but it has not always 
been 
so transparent 
in the case of geometric 
symmetries. 
The problem 
is that if dynamical 
theories 
are formulated 
in their traditional 
coordinate-dependent 
manner 
and geometric 
transformations 
are represented 
as transformations 
between 
coordinate-systems, 
T may 
be an asymmetry 
of the laws determining 
B, 
even 
though 
no T-asymmetric 
parameter 
appears 
in the ^-determining 
equations. 
This, 
combined 
with 
the historical 
confusion 
about 
the precise 
nature 
of the coordinate-dependence, 
obscured 
the physical 
significance 
of geometric 
transformations 
for generations. 
It is only 
in hindsight 
and 
by concentrating 
on their coordinate-mdependent 
(i.e. generally 
covariant) 
formulations 
that it becomes 
clear that geometric 
asymmetries 
of a set of 
5-determining 
laws can be understood 
in precisely 
the same manner 
as 
their non-geometric 
asymmetries, 
viz. as relevant permutations 
of the val 
ues of irrelevant 
parameters. 
And 
this is because 
it is only 
in the generally 
covariant 
formulations 
that the geometric 
asymmetries 
of the laws change 
the value 
of some parameter 
in the ??-determining 
equations. 
A 
slightly 
more 
detailed 
discussion 
is given 
in the appendix, 
but a 
quick 
example 
will 
help 
to illustrate 
the kind 
of confusion 
encouraged 
by 
the coordinate-dependent 
style of formulation. 
Consider 
an isolated 
Newtonian 
system 
consisting 
of a ball at rest on a frictionless 
surface. Let 
A\ 
be the coordinate 
description 
of the state of the ball at a time t\ and B\ 
its state one minute 
later at ti relative 
to a coordinate 
system with 
respect 

CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 
173 
to which 
the ball 
is at rest. Suppose 
that the ball remains 
isolated 
in the 
interim. 
(A\, B\) 
is a solution 
to Newton's 
laws, and since 
the laws are 
deterministic, 
A\ 
is the Curie-cause 
of B\. 
Now, 
consider 
the coordinate 
transformation 
T which 
takes every point 
(x, y, z, t) onto the corresponding 
point (x, y, z + at2, t). T carries (A\, B\) onto (TA\, TB\) which has 
the ball spontaneously 
accelerating 
in the z direction 
with 
no force acting 
on it, so although (A\, B\) 
is a solution to the laws, (TA\, TB\) 
is 
not. The 
situation 
is usually 
described 
by saying 
that Newton's 
laws hold 
'relative 
to' the first coordinate 
system 
but not 
'relative 
to' the second, 
and hence 
are not covariant 
with 
respect 
to transformations 
between 
the 
two. A better way 
to describe 
it is to say that there is some dynamically 
relevant difference 
between 
(A\, B\) 
and (TA\, TB\), 
a difference 
which 
is obscured 
by the fact that they get the same coordinate-description, 
simply 
relative 
to different 
coordinate 
systems. 
For surely, one is inclined 
to think, 
it doesn't matter which 
coordinate 
system one describes 
a given 
system 
in 
terms of. The difference 
shows up much more 
clearly 
on their coordinate 
independent 
representations 
where 
there 
is no relativity 
to a coordinate 
system and the difference between (A\,B\) 
and (TA\, TB\) 
is explicitly 
represented. 
This might 
be a good place 
to pause 
and say a word 
about the relation 
of Curie-causes 
and -effects 
to what 
we 
ordinarily 
call 
initial 
and final 
conditions. 
On 
the one hand, we 
think of the initial conditions 
relevant 
to 
some effect 
as the set of conditions 
which 
- 
by the lights of our theory 
- 
are sufficient 
to ensure 
its appearance, 
in the sense that in all models 
of the 
theory 
in which 
the initial conditions 
obtain, 
the effect 
obtains 
also 
(and 
which 
are such that, moreover, 
this is not true of any proper 
subset of them). 
On the other hand, we don't 
typically 
include among 
the initial conditions 
relevant 
to an effect B 
everything 
that goes 
into the specification 
of its 
Curie-cause, 
A. 
In particular, we don't 
include 
the intrinsic 
spatiotemporal 
structures which 
distinguish 
systems 
related by a geometric 
transformation 
that is not a symmetry 
of the laws. With 
respect 
to the Newtonian 
ball above, 
for example, 
something 
which 
fixes 
the inertial or non-inertial 
character 
of the system's motion 
must 
be included 
in A, but there is nothing 
in what 
we 
usually 
regard as the relevant 
initial conditions 
which 
does 
that, so 
these cannot be identified with 
the Curie-cause 
of B.9 
I think this is a real 
tension 
in our use of the notion 
of initial conditions. 
Whether 
we want 
to revise 
it by giving 
up the gloss, 
or by extending 
the notion 
of initial 
conditions 
so that they include 
everything 
that goes 
into the specification 
of the Curie-cause, 
is up for grabs.

5. HOW ONE COULD DOUBT THE PRINCIPLE 
Curie's 
Principle 
appears 
so simple and obvious 
on the reading 
I have given 
that some explanation 
is needed 
for why people 
have doubted 
it. There are a 
lot of ways 
one might 
go wrong: 
one reason, 
surely, 
is the general 
confusion 
surrounding 
the physical 
significance 
of geometric 
transformations, 
but 
there are others. Among 
them is the fact that Curie 
seems 
to have assumed 
that the world 
is governed 
by deterministic 
laws and so he often 
speaks 
as though we 
can infer simply from 
the existence 
of an asymmetry 
in the 
state of a system 
at a time, that there was 
an asymmetry 
in the state which 
preceded 
or that asymmetric 
causes 
intervened 
from 
the outside. 
This 
is 
a mistake; 
the world 
might 
be - 
and according 
to our current 
theories 
is ? riddled 
throughout 
with 
indeterministic 
events. We 
should 
keep 
the 
assumption 
of determinism 
separate from Curie's 
Principle 
and allow 
for 
indeterminism 
by reformulating 
the principle 
to say that we 
can infer from 
the existence 
of the asymmetry 
in some 
individual 
effect 
either 
that there 
was 
an asymmetry 
in the Curie-cause 
or that there was no Curie-cause. 
This 
is not 
to suggest, 
however, 
that the principle 
is useless 
in indeterministic 
contexts; 
far from 
it, but I will 
leave 
its application 
in such contexts 
to 
Section 
6. 
Another 
way 
to doubt 
the principle 
is to restrict what 
counts 
as a cause 
in such a way 
as to rule out some 
of the conditions 
which 
go 
into the 
specification 
of the Curie-cause. 
Return 
again 
to the Newtonian 
ball of 
the last section; 
I said that something 
which 
fixes whether 
the system 
is 
moving 
inertially 
or accelerating 
must 
be included 
in the Curie-cause. 
One 
might 
insist that no such thing could be included 
in the cause because 
the 
state of motion 
of a system 
is not one of its intrinsic 
features 
and only 
intrinsic 
features 
can be counted 
among 
the causes 
of its behavior. 
I don't 
think 
there 
is much 
to be said for such a position; 
it is clear from 
the 
examples Curie uses in his paper to illustrate the principle that he had no 
such restricted 
notion 
of cause 
in mind, 
nor is it consistent 
with 
our usage 
in either 
scientific 
or non-scientific 
contexts. We 
count the speed at which 
the car was 
traveling 
among 
the causes 
of the accident, 
and the differences 
in the velocity 
of light in different media 
among 
the causes 
of refraction. 
Yet another way 
to doubt 
the principle, 
and a particularly 
prevalent 
one, 
stems from 
a faulty definition 
of symmetry. 
It is related 
to the confusions 
encouraged 
by the coordinate-dependent 
style of formulation 
mentioned 
in the last section, 
and 
is illustrated 
by A.F. 
Chalmers 
in a 1970 paper. 
Chalmers 
writes: 
In a deterministic theory, Curie's Principle will be satisfied for a transformation T if the 
laws 
of the theory 
are 
invariant 
under T, 
for 
if neither 
a cause 
nor 
the appropriate 
laws 
change under T, the derivation of the corresponding effect will take an identical form 

CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 
175 
for the transformed and untransformed system and will yield identical expressions for the 
effect. (Chalmers 1970, 133) 
Chalmers 
restricts 
the application 
of the principle 
to transformations 
which 
are symmetries 
of the laws, because 
he thinks 
it would 
otherwise 
be vio 
lated by situations 
of the following 
kind: a law which 
is asymmetric 
with 
respect 
to T 
takes initial conditions 
symmetric 
with 
respect 
to T onto final 
conditions 
not 
so symmetric. 
For example, 
dynamical 
laws asymmetric 
under 
spatial 
reflection 
will 
evolve 
an experimental 
set-up which 
is sym 
metric 
under 
reflection 
onto one 
that is not. 
Suppose, 
we 
place 
a bit of 
cobalt-60 
in a magnetic 
field 
created by a ring current 
in a wire, 
and two 
feet away, 
the mirror 
image of the (cobalt + ring) 
set-up. The 
combined 
system [(cobalt + ring)r + (cobalt + ring)i] is symmetric with respect to 
reflection through the plane P separating the right system from the left, 
but the laws predict 
that in both subsystems 
the cobalt-60 
atoms will 
decay 
significantly 
more 
often 
on the right 
side. This means 
that the evolution 
of the combined 
system will 
not be symmetric 
with 
respect 
to reflection 
through P, 
for the reflection 
of the right system 
should 
show a prevalence 
of decay 
on the left, instead of the right. 
Is this a situation 
in which 
Curie's 
Principle 
is violated? 
No. A moment 
of thought 
should 
convince 
one 
that insofar as the laws predict 
the lop 
sided 
result, 
the initial experimental 
set-up 
cannot 
be 
symmetric 
under 
reflection. 
The 
theoretical 
description 
of the (cobalt + ring)r 
and (cobalt + 
ring)i 
cannot be the same because 
the two will 
evolve 
differently 
and the 
differences 
in the evolution 
are predicted 
by the laws (prevalence 
of decay 
in the direction 
of the field for one, and against 
the direction 
of the field for 
the other). Chalmers' 
confusion 
is the result of his definition 
of symmetry. 
Immediately 
preceding 
the passage 
quoted 
above he writes: 
Any 
transformation 
of the co-ordinate 
system 
that leaves 
the mathematical 
form 
of a law 
unchanged 
is a symmetry 
(or invariance 
transformation) 
for this law. (Chalmers 
1970, 
144) 
He 
is falling 
prey here to a mistake 
that has a long and venerable 
history. 
Since 
it has been 
clearly 
discussed 
and diagnosed 
by others, 
and since 
I discuss 
it in detail 
elsewhere, 
I will 
be short with 
it.10 Chalmers' 
def 
inition identifies the symmetries of a law with the transformations in its 
covariance 
group, 
i.e. the group of those transformations 
which 
preserve 
its 
truth. I mentioned 
above 
that there are two ways 
of formulating 
dynamical 
theories: 
(i) in the traditional 
style which makes 
use of coordinate 
systems 
and with 
respect 
to geometric 
transformations 
are expressed 
as transformations 
between 
coordinate 
systems, 
and 

176 
JENANN ISMAEL 
(ii) in a coordinate 
independent-style 
in which 
geometric 
transformations 
take the form of manifold 
automorphisms, 
one-one, 
suitably 
continu 
ous and differentiable 
mappings 
of neighborhoods 
of M 
into M. 
Any 
theory whatsoever 
can be formulated 
in the latter style, and ? 
so 
formulated 
? 
is covariant 
under 
arbitrary 
transformations. 
If we 
accept 
Chalmers' 
identification 
of the symmetries 
of a set of laws with 
its covari 
ance group, we will 
have 
to say that any law can be written 
in a form 
in 
which 
it is symmetric 
with 
respect 
to arbitrary 
transformations. 
Moreover, 
we will 
have 
to admit 
that the symmetries 
of a given 
law are not invariant 
under 
translation 
from 
one formulation 
into a mathematically 
equivalent 
one: formulated 
in a coordinate-independent 
manner 
its symmetries 
will 
be the group G of all one-one 
sufficiently 
continuous 
and differentiable 
transformations, 
and formulated 
in coordinate-dependent 
but mathemati 
cally equivalent 
manner 
its symmetries 
will 
form a proper 
subgroup 
of G. 
Clearly 
this isn't right. The 
symmetries 
of a set of equations 
are the auto 
morphisms 
of its set of solutions 
only when 
that set is well 
defined, 
i.e., 
when 
it is the same 
independent 
of its relation 
to any coordinate 
system, 
and this is so only when 
it is given 
a generally 
covariant 
formulation. 
If 
Chalmers 
had been 
thinking 
in terms of such a formulation, 
his mistake 
would 
have been clear to him because 
the left and right 
subsystems 
would 
have been distinguished 
by the value of some parameter which 
is not invari 
ant under reflection. 
This, again, 
is why 
I suggested 
we restrict our attention 
to the generally 
covariant 
formulations 
of theories, 
in the hope 
that we 
can 
avoid 
some 
of the confusions 
encouraged 
by 
the coordinate-dependent 
style. 
6. 
THE PRINCIPLE IN INDETERMINISTIC CONTEXTS 
I have suggested 
that we 
read Curie's 
Principle 
as an observation 
about how 
the symmetries 
of some effect 
are related 
to those of the conditions 
which 
determine 
it, if such there be. The 
'if such there be' expresses 
a significant 
restriction, for the deterministic theories which ruled physics in Curie's day 
have been 
superseded 
by quantum mechanics 
together with 
its notorious 
indeterminism. 
So the question 
arises: 
does Curie's 
Principle 
have 
any 
application 
where 
the laws in question 
are /?deterministic, 
and in particular, 
does 
it have any application 
in the context 
of quantum 
phenomena? 
The answer 
is, in both cases, yes. The difference 
between 
determinis 
tic and indeterministic 
laws is that the former map 
state-descriptions 
onto 
state-descriptions 
whereas 
the latter map 
state-descriptions 
onto proba 
bility functions which define a distribution over the set of possible state 

CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 
177 
descriptions.11 
The Curie-effect 
of an indeterministic 
law is just the result 
ing function, 
and its asymmetries 
are defined 
as follows: 
T 
is an asym 
metry 
of a probability 
function 
p just in case 
there is some Bi 
such that 
p(Bi) 
?? p(TBi). 
In the last section, I described experiments in which 
atoms of cobalt-60 
placed 
in a magnetic 
field 
show a prevalence 
of decay 
on the left over 
the right. Experiments 
like these were 
first carried out by 
Wu 
at Columbia 
in 1956, and prompted 
the recognition 
of the asymmetry 
of the laws with 
respect 
to spatial 
reflection. 
The 
context 
is an indeter 
ministic 
one, 
and the recognition 
of the asymmetry 
of the laws involves 
an application 
of Curie's 
Principle: 
the direction 
of decay 
is in each case 
regarded 
as undetermined, 
but the laws are assumed 
to entail a probability 
distribution 
over possible 
directions 
of decay which 
explains 
the relative 
frequency 
of directions 
in a long run of tests. The 
left/right 
asymmetric 
effect which 
requires 
explanation, 
then, is not the direction 
of any individ 
ual decay event but the probability distribution which favors left over right 
directions 
of decay. The 
significantly 
greater frequency 
of left-side 
decays 
makes 
for a left/right 
asymmetry 
in the Curie-effect, 
and hence by Curie's 
Principle, 
the Curie-cause 
A of B 
cannot be intrinsically 
symmetric 
under 
exchange 
of left and right. 
The principle 
has another role in indeterministic 
contexts, 
for it suggests 
a precise 
criterion 
for separating 
the chancy from the law-governed 
aspects 
of a system. Define 
the coarse-state 
of a system governed 
by an indetermin 
istic law as the most 
complete 
state-description 
Bc 
such that p(Bc) 
= 
1. 
If we 
call 
the state-descriptions 
over which 
the distribution 
is given 
the 
fine-states, 
the coarse-state 
determined 
by a given probability 
function 
is 
the incomplete 
state-description 
which 
includes 
all and only those features 
common 
to all of the fine-states 
which 
get a non-zero 
probability. 
Now 
we 
can say that transformations 
which 
are symmetries 
of the coarse 
state 
but not symmetries 
of the fine 
states will 
in general 
be permutations 
of 
chancy features 
of the system. 
Consider, 
for instance, 
the indeterministic 
process 
in which 
an alpha-particle 
is emitted 
from 
a radioactive 
nucleus 
and suppose 
that the state of the nucleus 
is such that the particle 
is no more 
likely 
to be emitted 
in any one direction 
than another. The coarse 
state of 
the nucleus 
is in this case 
spherically 
symmetrical 
but the fine-states 
are 
not, since each of them specifies 
a particular 
direction 
for emission. 
Those 
aspects 
of the fine-states 
which 
break the spherical 
symmetry 
of the coarse 
state, i.e., the direction 
in which 
the particle 
is actually 
emitted, 
are just its 
unpredictable 
aspects. 
So let it no longer be said that Curie's Principle doesn't apply in indeter 
ministic 
contexts; 
it has all the force 
it does 
in deterministic 
contexts, 
and 
more. Not 
only does 
it relate the asymmetries 
of the probability 
distribution 

178 
JENANN ISMAEL 
over possible 
final 
states which 
acts as the Curie-cause 
in indeterminisitic 
contexts 
to those of the initial state, but it provides 
a precise 
criterion 
for 
separating 
the chancy from 
the law-governed 
features 
of the final 
state. 
Showing 
how 
it applies 
specifically 
to quantum mechanics 
is somewhat 
complicated 
because 
of interpretive 
disputes 
about the theory; 
the best we 
can do is to divide 
interpretations 
into two classes 
and say how Curie's 
Prin 
ciple applies 
to the interpretations 
in each class. On 
interpretations 
which 
incorporate 
a so-called 
'collapse 
postulate', 
the state of an isolated 
system 
evolves 
deterministically 
except during 
'measurement' 
when 
it 'collapses' 
into a state probabilistically 
determined 
by its state before 
the interaction.12 
So on interpretations 
of quantum mechanics 
which 
incorporate 
a collapse 
postulate, 
the law which 
determines 
the probability 
distribution 
over 
the 
outcomes 
of measurement 
interactions 
for systems 
given 
the state of the 
system 
before 
interaction, 
i.e., Born's 
rule, is treated as an indeterministic 
dynamical 
law. On 
interpretations 
of quantum 
mechanics 
which 
incor 
porate 
no collapse 
postulate, 
by contrast, 
Born's 
rule is treated as a law 
of coexistence 
relating partial 
state descriptions 
to a probability 
distribu 
tion over fuller 
state descriptions. 
The 
former 
include 
only 
the values 
of 
observables 
of which 
the system 
is in an eigenstate, 
the latter include 
the 
values 
of additional 
observables.13 
In either 
case, 
i.e., whether 
the Born 
probability 
of a value 
a for an observable 
A for a system 
in a state ^ 
is 
interpreted 
as the probability 
that if we measure 
A 
it will 
evolve 
into an 
eigenstate 
of A with 
eigenvalue 
a or as the probability 
that the system 
in 
fact possesses 
value 
a for A, Born's 
rule is treated as an indeterministic 
law which 
maps 
the state-descriptions 
onto a probability 
distribution 
over 
state-descriptions. 
And 
in either case, 
the former 
is the Curie-cause 
of the 
latter, and Curie's 
Principle 
applies 
to them just as it does 
in deterministic 
contexts. 
As 
to separating 
the chancy from 
the law-governed 
aspects 
of a quantum 
mechanical 
system; 
a system's 
coarse-state 
includes 
values 
for all observ 
ables of which 
it is in an eigenstate 
and is symmetric 
under permutations 
of the values 
of observables 
of which 
it is not. Its fine-states, 
on the other 
hand, 
include values 
for observables 
of which 
it is not in an eigenstate 
and 
hence 
are not 
symmetric 
under 
permutations 
of those values. Moreover, 
there are no other transformations 
which 
are asymmetries 
of the fine-states 
and are not asymmetries 
of the coarse-state. 
Applying 
our criterion 
for sep 
arating 
the chancy 
from the law-governed 
aspects 
to quantum mechanical 
systems, 
then, we 
get that the values which 
a system possesses 
(or comes 
to possess 
after a measurement 
of the right sort) for observables 
of which 
it is not in an eigenstate 
are chancy, 
and are ? moreover 
- 
the only chancy 
features 
of its state. This 
is just the right 
result. 

CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 179 
7. 
SPONTANEOUS SYMMETRY BREAKING 
Having 
given 
an argument 
to the effect 
that spontaneous 
symmetry 
break 
ing is impossible, 
I had better 
consider 
the actual phenomena 
physicists 
call by that name 
and show that they do not provide 
counterexamples. 
The 
most 
striking example 
of abrupt symmetry 
change, 
and also one of the first 
to be discovered, 
is Euler's 
load: if we 
take a vertical 
column 
and load it 
from 
the top with 
a perfectly 
symmetrical 
distribution 
of weight, 
when 
the 
load reaches 
a critical 
value, 
the rod will 
buckle 
breaking 
the symmetry 
of the initial conditions. 
Other 
examples 
include 
the change 
of symmetry 
that occurs 
in a liquid uniformly 
heated 
from 
below 
when 
the vertical 
temperature 
gradient 
reaches 
a critical value, 
an effect demonstrated 
quite 
indisputably 
in experiments 
performed 
by Benard?a 
colleague 
of Curie 
in 
Paris ? 
in 1900. Poincare 
- also a Paris colleague 
of Curie's 
- discovered 
asymmetric 
pear-shapes 
of fast rotating 
fluid masses 
in self-gravitating 
equilibrium 
.. .just to mention 
a couple 
of instances which 
were 
around 
and available 
to Curie 
long before 
the instances 
of spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking 
(usually 
in the contexts 
of superconductivity 
and quantum 
field 
theory) which 
occupy 
physicists 
nowadays. 
In these 
cases, 
as with 
the 
buckling 
rod, the symmetry 
breaks down when 
a scalar parameter 
reaches 
a critical value, without 
the intervention 
of visibly 
asymmetric 
causes, 
and 
the symmetry 
of the initial 
state is larger than that of the resulting 
state. 
But 
in light of what 
preceded, 
unless 
these are indeterministic 
phenomena, 
Curie's 
Principle 
is violated. What 
is going 
on? 
The clue to the explanation 
lies in the phrase 
'without 
the intervention 
of visibly 
asymmetrical 
causes'. 
The case of Euler's 
load, though 
striking, 
is somewhat 
different 
than the others. Here, 
the buckling 
of the rod in a 
particular 
direction 
appears 
to be a genuinely 
indeterministic 
phenomenon. 
When 
the load reaches 
a particular weight, 
the differential 
equations which 
express 
the functional 
dependence 
of the behavior 
of the column 
on the 
load simply 
break down. The column 
buckles, 
and ? so long as the situa 
tion is perfectly 
rotationally 
symmetric 
- there is no predicting 
beforehand 
the direction 
in which 
it will 
go. The 
other 
cases 
are more 
interesting, 
and result from 
the non-linearity 
of the dynamics.14 
With 
respect 
to actual 
physical 
systems, 
the symmetry 
of both causes 
and effects 
is seldom 
exact: 
in part because of the impossibility of completely decoupling a system 
from 
its surroundings, 
in part because 
of the inevitable 
presence 
of exper 
imental 
error, and in part because 
of the presence 
of fluctuations 
(whether 
thermal 
or quantum 
mechanical). 
Where 
the dynamics 
are governed 
by 
non-linear 
equations, 
it is not true that nearly 
symmetric 
causes 
produce 
nearly 
symmetric 
effects 
or vice versa. On 
the contrary, not only can large 
asymmetrical 
causes 
produce 
small 
(even undetectable) 
effects, 
but large 

180 
JENANN ISMAEL 
asymmetric 
effects may 
arise from seemingly 
symmetrical 
causes. 
Seem 
ingly 
symmetrical, 
but not entirely 
so; there are always 
the fluctuations. 
What 
happens 
in every case of so-called 
spontaneous 
symmetry 
breaking 
in current physics 
is that when 
some 
(usually 
scalar) parameter 
reaches 
a 
critical value, 
the symmetric 
solutions 
cease 
to be stable under 
small exter 
nal chance 
perturbations, 
and so pushing 
the parameter 
past 
the critical 
value will make 
the system 
vulnerable 
to perturbations 
that carry 
it into 
an asymmetrical 
state. The 
symmetrical 
solution 
always 
exists 
but is not 
always 
stable for all values 
of the parameters 
that enter the equations 
of 
motion. 
Where 
it is not, asymmetrical 
solutions may 
appear that are stable, 
thus precipitating 
a change 
in the symmetry 
of the system 
that appears 
to 
be occasioned 
solely 
by the change 
of a scalar parameter. 
In general, 
if a 
system 
is non-linear 
and possesses 
bifurcation 
points where 
a set of sta 
ble solutions 
of lower symmetry 
branch off from the original 
symmetrical 
solution 
and the system 
is subject 
to external 
chance perturbations, 
a very 
small chance perturbation 
may 
switch 
the solution 
to an asymmetrical 
one. 
It should 
be clear 
that there 
is nothing 
in this which 
violates 
Curie's 
Principle. 
These 
are not cases of systems 
governed 
by deterministic 
equa 
tions in which 
all symmetries 
of causally 
relevant factors are not preserved 
in the effect, but rather cases 
in which 
the effect of certain causally 
relevant 
factors 
(the external 
perturbations) 
appear only under 
certain 
conditions, 
viz. when 
some other parameter 
reaches 
a critical 
value. 
The 
situation 
is 
commonplace 
but particularly 
striking 
in non-linear 
contexts 
where 
the 
causes 
are so small and the effects 
so large; in such cases, 
the cause 
is so 
apparently 
symmetrical 
and the effect 
so evidently 
not so, but the asym 
metries 
in the effects 
are still present 
in the causes. 
8. 
THE PRINCIPLE AND HIDDEN VARIABLES 
No discussion 
of Curie's 
Principle 
would 
be complete without 
saying 
some 
thing about 
its connection 
with 
hidden 
variables. 
If A 
is the Curie-cause 
of B, A 
is fixed 
(up to a constant) 
by the values 
of the parameters 
on the 
left-hand 
side of the i?-determining 
equations 
in a generally 
covariant 
for 
mulation. 
Curie's 
Principle 
entails 
that if T 
is a characteristic 
asymmetry 
of 
B, 
dit least one of the parameters 
which 
characterizes 
A is characteristically 
asymmetric 
with 
respect 
to T. Call T a hidden 
characteristic 
asymmetry 
of A just in case T 
is an asymmetry 
of A, but the specifications 
A4 and 
TAi 
are not all distinguishable 
by unimplemented 
sight, 
i.e. in case, 
for 
all Ai, we 
cannot 
commonly 
distinguish 
Ai from TAi 
'just by looking'.15 
And 
call T 
an apparent 
characteristic 
asymmetry 
just 
in case 
it is an 
asymmetry 
which 
is not hidden. 
It is certainly 
possible 
for apparently 
T 

CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 181 
symmetric 
states to evolve 
deterministically 
into apparently T-asymmetric 
states, but Curie's 
Principle 
entails 
that in every 
such case T 
is a hidden 
characteristic 
asymmetry 
of the initial state. Hence, 
if an isolated 
system 
in an apparently 
symmetric 
state evolves 
into a state that is evidently 
T 
asymmetric, 
so long as the evolution 
is deterministic 
we 
can conclude 
that the symmetric 
facade 
of the initial 
state was 
a dupe: 
it concealed 
all of the characteristic 
asymmetries 
revealed 
in the final 
state. Molecu 
lar biology 
is replete with 
particularly 
impressive 
instances 
of apparently 
T-symmetric 
conditions 
giving 
rise, by evidently 
deterministic 
processes, 
to apparently 
T-asymmetric 
effects. 
Frog 
zygotes, 
for example, 
start out 
as spherical 
cells 
suspended 
in an homogenous 
seeming 
fluid and develop 
into highly 
structured 
organisms; 
almost 
every 
stage in their development 
introduces 
asymmetries 
not apparently 
present 
in the preceding 
stage. By 
Curie's 
Principle, 
if the process 
is deterministic, 
the initial state is?despite 
appearances 
? at least as asymmetric 
as the final.16 
If we 
combine 
Curie's 
Principle 
with 
a methodological 
principle 
to the 
effect 
that the only theoretical 
reason for postulating 
a hidden 
characteristic 
asymmetry 
is as the nomological 
determinant 
of some apparent asymmetry, 
we 
can derive 
a great deal about how the apparent 
structure of the physical 
world 
relates to the underlying 
physical 
structure postulated 
by our theories. 
For together 
they entail 
that the hidden 
causes 
postulated 
by our theories 
should 
collectively 
conceal 
as much 
asymmetry 
as is revealed 
in their 
collective 
effects 
and only 
so much 
asymmetry 
as is revealed 
in their 
collective 
effects.17 
This narrows 
the class of theories quite drastically, 
but 
doesn't 
come 
close 
to picking 
out a unique 
one. A 
theory will 
typically 
regard a single hidden 
parameter 
as causally 
implicated 
in a wide 
range of 
distinct 
effects while 
being only partially 
responsible 
for any given one. So 
even 
if we know 
that the asymmetries 
in any effect are present 
in its Curie 
cause and we require that Curie-causes 
have no hidden asymmetries 
that are 
not asymmetries 
of their effects, 
there is still room for differences 
in theory 
in the way 
in which 
the asymmetries 
get divided 
up and distributed 
among 
the individual 
parameters. 
There 
are better ways 
of doing 
the dividing 
up, 
of course, 
but what 
they are is a question 
to which 
neither Curie's 
Principle 
nor the above methodological 
principle, 
answers. 
9. 
EXEGETICAL SUPPORT 
There 
is some 
unfinished 
business; 
I need 
to address 
the question 
of 
whether 
the reading 
of Curie's 
Principle 
that I have given 
captures Curie's 
own 
intentions. 
Curie writes 
that "when 
certain 
causes 
produce 
certain 
effects, 
the symmetry 
elements 
of the causes must be found 
in the produced 

182 
JENANN ISMAEL 
effects". 
This 
raises 
two exegetical 
questions: 
(i) what 
is meant 
by 
'cause' 
and 
'effect'? 
and (ii) how do we 
define 
the symmetries 
of the causes 
and 
effects, 
so construed? 
I have 
read the principle 
as asserting 
that the char 
acteristic 
symmetries 
of a Curie-cause 
are also characteristic 
symmetries 
of 
its effect, 
i.e., as asserting 
that if the laws provide 
a many-one 
map 
ping of a family A ? 
{A\, A2, ^3,...} 
of alternative 
events 
into a family 
B = 
{B\, B2,2?3, 
. }, then the transformations 
which 
are symmetries 
of 
all of the Ai 
s are also symmetries 
of all of the J3?'s. So far as I can see, no 
other reading 
of the principle 
is compatible 
with 
the examples 
with which 
Curie 
illustrates 
it and the application 
which 
he makes 
of it in his paper. 
The paper 
is quite beautiful; 
in it Curie does much more 
than simply 
state 
his principle, 
he uses 
it to derive 
the intrinsic 
symmetries 
of the electric 
and 
magnetic 
field 
quantities 
from 
the description 
of certain 
carefully 
chosen 
experimental 
phenomena. 
The 
application 
he makes 
of the principle 
in 
these arguments 
leaves 
little doubt as to how he intends 
it to be understood. 
All 
have 
the same form: 
the set of symmetries 
of a quantity 
q is shown 
to 
coincide with 
a group G by application 
of Curie's 
Principle 
to experimental 
situations 
in which 
q figures 
as part of the effect of some phenomenon 
and 
the cause of some other. The first is used 
to establish 
that the symmetries 
of 
q include all of the transformations 
in G, 
the second 
is used 
to establish 
that 
the symmetries 
of q include no transformations 
not in G. The 
conclusion 
is that the group of intrinsic 
symmetries 
of q is exactly G. 
The 
argument 
deriving 
the intrinsic 
symmetry 
of the electric 
field 
at 
a point, 
for example, 
goes 
like this. Consider 
the groups 
of symmetries 
associated, 
respectively, 
with 
(A) a cylinder 
at rest, 
(B) a system 
consisting 
of two coaxial 
cylinders 
rotating 
in opposite 
direc 
tions, 
(C) an arrow, and 
(D) a cylinder 
rotating 
about 
its axis. 
Assume 
that mass 
is a scalar 
quantity, 
that linear momentum 
has 
the 
symmetry 
of (C), and that angular momentum 
has the symmetry 
of (D). 
Now, 
consider 
the electric 
field 
at the center of a parallel 
plate 
condenser 
made 
up of two oppositely 
charged 
discs. 
The 
cause 
of the field 
has the 
symmetry of (C), with the line through the center of the disks as the 
isotropic 
axis. From Curie's 
Principle 
it follows 
that the symmetry 
group 
of the field at the center of the condenser 
must 
include 
the transformations 
in (C). Next, 
consider 
a point charge placed 
at a point p in space where 
there 
is an electric 
field. The charge will 
experience 
a force which 
has symmetry 
(C), and so ? 
again from Curie's 
Principle 
? 
it follows 
that the symmetry 

CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 
183 
(C), and so ? 
again from Curie's 
Principle 
? 
it follows 
that the symmetry 
group of the field at p includes 
only transformations 
in (C). These 
together 
entail 
that the intrinsic 
symmetry 
group 
of the electric 
field 
at a point 
is 
just(C). 
The argument 
that the intrinsic 
symmetry 
of an electric 
current 
is also 
(C) follows 
the same pattern. Curie 
considers 
two situations, 
one in which 
a current 
is the effect 
of an electric 
field and another 
in which 
a current 
is 
the cause of chemical 
decomposition 
in electrolysis. 
Application 
of Curie's 
Principle 
to the former 
establishes 
that the symmetry 
of the current 
is at 
most 
(C), application 
of Curie's 
Principle 
to the latter establishes 
that the 
symmetry 
of the current 
is at least (C), and it follows 
that the symmetry 
of an electric 
current 
is exactly 
(C). So, also, goes 
the argument 
that the 
magnetic 
field 
at a point 
has the intrinsic 
symmetry 
of (D); the relevant 
experimental 
situations 
in this case are those 
in which 
a magnetic 
field 
is 
caused by a current 
in a circular 
coil and causes 
electromagnetic 
induction, 
respectively. 
In all of these arguments, 
and in every example 
Curie discusses 
in other 
sections 
of the paper, Curie's 
Principle 
is applied 
to conditions 
related only 
as Curie-cause 
to Curie-effect. 
Curie 
is quite explicit 
that this is what 
he 
intends; he writes 
"whenever 
a physical 
phenomenon 
is expressed 
as an 
equation, 
there is a causal 
relation between 
the quantities 
appearing 
in both 
terms". Moreover, 
it is clear that this is all that is required 
for the validity 
of the arguments. 
There 
remains 
the question 
of whether 
the symmetries 
in question 
are symmetries 
of particular 
specifications 
of Curie-causes 
and 
-effects 
or characteristic 
symmetries 
of the families 
as wholes, 
i.e. 
symmetries 
of each 
specification 
in the two families, 
respectively. 
There 
are two 
reasons 
for thinking 
that Curie 
intends 
the latter. The first 
is 
interpretive 
charity; 
if we 
read him as meaning 
the former, 
the principle 
is 
false. 
Indeed, 
quite obviously 
so; the example 
of bald and hairy particles 
given 
in Section 
2 is a clear counterexample 
and 
it is easy 
to generate 
others. 
The 
second 
reason 
is that in the above 
arguments, 
the existence 
of any 
specification 
of A 
that is T-asymmetric 
is sufficient 
to establish 
the T-asymmetry 
of A, 
the existence 
of any specification 
of B 
that is T 
asymmetric 
is sufficient 
to establish 
the T-asymmetry 
of B, 
and Curie's 
Principle 
is taken 
to entail 
that the asymmetries 
of B 
(so established), 
are also 
asymmetries 
of A 
(so established). 
Curie 
finds 
one among 
the 
possible 
specifications 
Aj of A which 
is T-asymmetric 
and one among 
the 
possible 
specifications 
Bk 
of B 
that is T-asymmetric, 
and concludes 
that 
A and B 
are both T-asymmetric. 
He 
does not require 
that the particular 
T-asymmetric 
specifications 
invoked 
be related 
as individual 
cause 
and 
effect, 
i.e. he does not require 
that (Aj, Bk) 
is itself a solution 
to the laws. 

184 
JENANN ISMAEL 
Curie's 
Principle 
is often 
read as though 
it did, i.e. as though 
it states that 
the symmetries 
(idiosyncratic 
and characteristic 
alike) 
of each particular 
specification 
of a Curie-cause 
must 
also be present 
in the specifications 
of its corresponding 
effect. And 
indeed, 
the principle 
- 
separated from 
its 
context?is 
ambiguous 
between 
such a reading and the reading 
I have given, 
but a look at Curie's 
examples 
and his own application 
of the principle 
in 
the paper 
is quite 
enough 
to clear up the ambiguity. 
There 
can be 
little 
serious 
doubt as to his real intentions. 
10. 
IS THE PRINCIPLE TRIVIAL? 
I will take a moment before concluding to fend off the objection that 
Curie's 
Principle 
? as I've interpreted 
it ? 
is trivial. There 
is one sense 
in 
which 
it is trivial, namely 
that it follows 
from the definitions 
of the terms 
in which 
it is stated. This 
sort of triviality, 
however, 
does 
not render 
it 
insignificant, 
for it must 
be granted 
that there are mathematical 
theorems 
which 
both 
follow 
from 
the definitions 
of their terms and have 
a great 
degree 
of physical 
import. A more 
serious worry 
is that the Principle 
is 
not only 
trivial but too obvious 
to be interesting. 
It doesn't 
require 
a long 
proof 
or reveal 
subtle and unexpected 
connections; 
one scarcely 
needs 
to 
unpack 
the definitions 
to see that it is true. The 
right way 
to answer 
this, 
I think, 
is to reply 
that therein 
lies 
its beauty. Here 
is an analogy: 
any 
plane figure 
can be represented 
in either of two ways, 
by a line diagram 
on a page 
or by the function 
which 
generates 
it. Some 
truths about 
the 
relations 
between 
such figures 
require 
complicated 
algebraic 
proofs 
but 
are conspicuously 
true if we 
look at the corresponding 
line diagrams, 
e.g., 
the fact that figure A is embeddable 
in figure B. Other 
truths about relations 
between 
figures 
are almost 
impossible 
to discern from 
their line drawings 
but are easy 
to see with 
a quick 
peek 
at the functions 
which 
describe 
them, e.g., 
the fact that A results from 
the composition 
of functions which 
generate B 
and C. One has an elegant way 
of representing 
a type of object 
when 
the most 
important 
truths about 
those objects 
appear obvious 
when 
they are so represented. 
It is nothing 
more 
than a recommendation 
of 
conceiving 
of physical 
laws as a function 
from one 
set into another 
and 
attending 
to the characteristic 
symmetries 
of the elements 
in the two sets, 
that Curie's 
Principle 
appears obvious when 
one does. The substance 
of the 
principle 
derives from 
the fact that the simple 
relation 
it expresses 
between 
the symmetries 
of the domain 
and range of a function 
can often 
be used 
to draw 
conclusions 
about 
the former which 
cannot 
be gleaned 
directly 
from observation, 
from 
information 
about 
the latter which 
can. It lies not 
in seeing 
that the principle 
is true, but in recognizing 
phenomena 
in the 

CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 185 
physical 
world 
which 
are related 
as Curie-cause 
to -effect, 
and applying 
Curie's 
Principle 
to draw conclusions 
from 
the observed 
asymmetries 
of 
the latter about the often hidden 
asymmetries 
of the former. 
Some 
instances 
of such applications 
that I have mentioned 
are these: 
(i) the case of the development of frog zygotes described in Section 8 in 
which 
the apparent determinism 
of the process, 
combined 
with 
infor 
mation 
about the evident geometric 
asymmetries 
of the final stage, tells 
us a great deal about the hidden 
structure of the apparently 
spherically 
symmetric 
early stages, 
(ii) Curie's 
arguments, 
described 
in Section 
9, deriving 
the characteristic 
symmetries 
of the electromagnetic 
field quantities, 
and finally, 
(iii) also 
touched 
on 
in Section 
9, 
the characteristic 
asymmetries 
of 
the appearances, 
represented 
by the empirical 
substructures 
of a the 
ory's models, 
must 
also be characteristic 
asymmetries 
of the underly 
ing physical 
structure postulated 
by theories 
and represented 
by their 
higher-level 
structure. This 
expresses 
the only a priori 
constraint 
that 
the appearances 
place 
on the higher 
level theoretical 
structure of our 
models. 
11. CONCLUSION 
In the year before Curie's 
paper was published 
in the Journal 
de Physique, 
Sophus Lie published 
the third and final volume 
of his Theorie 
der Trans 
formationsgruppen 
in the preface 
to which 
he urged deliberate 
attention 
to 
the symmetries 
of physical 
laws. Though 
Lie 
and Curie were 
contempo 
raries, their emphases 
were 
quite different; 
Lie focused 
on the symmetries 
as mathematical 
properties 
of the laws, whereas 
Curie 
concentrated 
on the 
characteristic 
symmetries 
of the physical 
states themselves. 
In the centu 
ry separating 
us from 
the years 
in which 
those 
seminal works 
came out, 
physicists 
have 
followed 
Lie's mathematical 
emphasis 
and Curie's 
basic 
physical insight has been all but lost. 
The 
insight, as I've suggested, 
was beautifully 
simple and quite obvious 
once 
one 
adopted 
Curie's 
perspective: 
a physical 
law can be 
identified 
with 
a function from 
one 
set of physical 
states 
into another. 
If the law is 
a dynamical 
law, the states 
in question 
are the states of a system 
at two 
different 
times; if it is a law of coexistence, 
they are partial state descriptions 
of a system 
at a single 
time. Curie's 
Principle 
follows 
just from 
the notion 
of such a function; 
it says that all transformations 
which 
are characteristic 
symmetries 
of the former 
are also characteristic 
symmetries 
of the latter. 
More 
intuitively, 
it says 
that transformations 
which 
leave 
the values 
of 

186 
JENANN ISMAEL 
all relevant 
parameters 
unchanged 
also 
leave unchanged 
their effects. We 
have seen physical applications of the principle ranging from guiding 
the postulation of hidden variables in theorizing to providing a criterion 
for separating 
out the chancy 
aspects 
of a system's 
evolution. 
I have not 
said much 
about 
its broader 
philosophical 
import, but it should 
be clear 
that the way 
symmetries 
operate 
in physics 
suggests 
an understanding 
of 
the scientific 
applications 
of some philosophically 
important 
notions. 
It 
suggests, 
in particular, 
that A 
is causally 
relevant 
to B 
just in case the B 
determining 
laws are not symmetric 
with 
respect 
to arbitrary permutations 
of the values 
of A, and that if (counterfactually) 
Ai had occurred, 
then Bi 
would 
have occurred 
as well; moreover, 
if A? had occurred, 
then no other 
Bi would 
have. 
In sum, echoing 
the first sentence 
of Curie's 
paper, 
I think 
that there 
is much 
interest 
in introducing 
into philosophy 
the symmetry 
considerations 
familiar 
to physicists, 
and Curie's 
Principle 
is a very good 
place 
to start. 
APPENDIX: NON-GENERALLY COVARIANT FORMULATIONS AND GEOMETRIC 
TRANSFORMATIONS 
A dynamical 
theory 
is typically 
presented 
as a state space 
together with 
a 
set of laws; 
if the laws are deterministic, 
they pick out a group 
(or semi 
group) 
of evolution 
operators 
{Ud} 
such that if the state at t is \&, then 
the state at t + d is Ud(^}. A trajectory through the state space ^(t) 
satisfies the laws just in case for all t and d, ^(t + d) = Ud^(t). 
If T is a 
transformation 
defined 
on the state space, 
(i) T is a symmetry of state * iffT^l = * 
(ii) T is a symmetry of a set ? 
of states iffT ? =def {T* 
: * in ?} 
(iii) T is a symmetry of the laws iff for all d, TUd = UdT, i.e. V^T(Ud^) 
= Ud(T$). Equivalents, iff Ud = T~xUdT for all d. 
Now, clearly if * = T* 
then T(UdV) = TT-lUdT($) 
= UdT^, so 
if T 
is a symmetry 
of the initial state and the laws, then it is a symmetry 
of the final 
state. What 
is harder 
to see, but is nevertheless 
true, is that if 
T 
is not a symmetry 
of the laws then it is not a symmetry 
of the set ^2 ?f 
possible 
initial states. 
Let A be the state at some 
initial 
time, and let B 
be the state at a final 
time, and suppose 
T 
is an asymmetry 
of the laws. 
If there exist two physically possible trajectories (A?, Bi) and T(Ai, Bi) 
where Bi ^ TBi, 
it must also be the case that A? ^ TAi. But if there is 
some Ai 
such that A? ^ TAi, 
then T 
is not an characteristic 
symmetry 
of 
A, notwithstanding 
the fact that in the traditional 
formulation, 
A? and TAi 

CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 
187 
have the same coordinate-dependent 
description. 
For those descriptions 
are 
given 
relative 
to different 
coordinate 
systems 
and there are dynamically 
relevant 
differences 
between 
the manifolds 
they represent. 
Consider 
the example 
I gave 
in Section 
4 of an isolated Newtonian 
system 
consisting 
of a ball at rest on a frictionless 
surface. A\ 
is the state 
of the ball at a time t\, B\ 
is its state one minute 
later at ?2 both 
in their 
coordinate-dependent 
form relative 
to a coordinate 
system with 
respect 
to 
which 
the ball 
is at rest; and suppose 
that the ball remains 
isolated 
in the 
interim. 
(A\, B\) 
is a solution 
to Newton's 
laws, and A\ 
is the Curie 
cause 
of B\. Now, 
consider 
the coordinate 
transformation 
T which 
takes 
every point 
(x, y, z, t) onto 
the corresponding 
point 
(x, y, z + 
at2, 
t); 
T carries (A\, B\) 
onto (TAi, TB\) which has the ball spontaneously 
accelerating 
in the z direction 
with 
no force 
acting 
on it. Newton's 
laws 
in their traditional 
coordinate-dependent 
representation 
are not covariant 
with 
respect 
to T, and it is evident 
in this case that the description 
of the 
ball's 
trajectory 
relative 
to a coordinate 
system 
obtained 
from 
the original 
by T does not satisfy 
them. 
What is going on can be described crudely (though well enough for our 
purposes) 
as follows. 
There 
are dynamically 
relevant differences 
between 
manifolds 
represented 
by Cartesian 
coordinate-systems 
moving 
non 
inertially with 
respect 
to one another. Hence, 
in moving 
from 
the mani 
fold represented 
by the first coordinate 
system 
to the manifold 
represented 
by the second, 
something 
on which 
the dynamical 
behavior 
of Newtoni 
an systems 
depends 
is changed, 
so the relativity 
to a coordinate 
system 
expresses 
a dependence 
on parameters 
which 
must 
be explicitly 
includ 
ed if one 
is to formulate 
laws which 
hold 
'absolutely', 
i.e. relative 
to all 
coordinate 
systems. 
This 
is what 
is done 
in the generally 
covariant, 
or 
'coordinate-independent', 
representation. 
Whereas 
in traditional 
formula 
tions one 
states dynamical 
laws which 
hold 
only 
'relative 
to' manifolds 
with 
particular 
intrinsic 
structures 
and which 
are hence 
covariant 
only 
under 
automorphisms 
which 
preserve 
those 
structures, 
in the generally 
covariant 
formulations 
one 
states 
laws which 
explicitly 
relate dynamical 
behavior 
to the relevant 
intrinsic 
structures. The new 
laws hold 
'relative to' 
all manifolds 
and are consequently 
covariant with 
respect 
to all transfor 
mations 
between 
them. This 
is why 
it is true only of the generally 
covariant 
formulation 
of a theory that if T 
is a geometric 
asymmetry 
of its laws, there 
is a parameter 
in the B-determining 
equations 
which 
is not invariant under 
T. 
In the same way, 
if we have 
laws which 
hold only 
'relative 
to' systems 
of one or another mass, 
in order to formulate 
laws which 
hold for systems 
of any mass, 
we 
have 
to relate 
the behavior 
of a system 
to its mass 
and

a new parameter 
representing 
mass 
(i.e., not 
invariant under 
changes 
in 
mass) 
will 
appear 
in the equations.

2 I'll suppress the relativity from here on, though talk of A being the Curie-cause of some 
effect B is always to be understood as tacitly relativized to the laws of a theory. 
3 It follows from the definition of a characteristic symmetry that T is an idiosyncratic 
asymmetry 
of 
(i.e. 
is not 
a characteristic 
symmetry 
of ) some 
specification 
of 
a A 
(or 
B) 
iff it is not a characteristic symmetry of A (or B). We get the second formulation of 
Curie's Principle by taking the contrapositive of the first (i.e., if T is not a characteristic 
symmetry 
of a Curie-effect 
B, 
then 
it is not a characteristic 
symmetry 
of 
its Curie-cause, 
A), and replacing the antecedent and conclusion with their equivalents under the definition 
of characteristic 
symmetry. 
4 Notice that the fact that we can write down pairs of specifications (Ai, Bi) 
and {TAi, 
TBi), where TAj = Aj but TBj 
^ Bj 
(as, for example, is the case if A and B are 
far enough apart that T operates on B but not on A) is unimportant. What 
is ruled out 
by Curie's Principle is the existence of pairs of solutions to the laws (Ai, Bi) and (TAi, 
TBi), 
such that TAj = Aj but TBj ? Bj.

7 Let me 
emphasize 
that 
the covariance 
group 
and 
the symmetry 
group 
of a theory 
are 
two different 
things. 
The 
covariance 
group 
is the set of coordinate 
transformations 
which 
preserve 
the truth of the laws. The 
symmetry 
group 
of a theory 
is the set of automorphisms 
of 
its solution 
set, 
the transformations 
which 
never 
take you from 
a solution 
onto 
a non 
solution, 
or vice 
versa. 
8 Since 
it is not necessarily 
the case 
that the A's 
can be represented 
as a function 
of the B's 
(i.e. 
that the mapping 
is one-one), 
it doesn't 
follow 
that differences 
in the A's 
are always 
accompanied by differences in the B's, and hence it doesn't follow that the asymmetries of 
the A's 
are also 
asymmetries 
of the B's. 
I will 
come 
back 
to this in Section 
8. 
9 We usually regard the positions and momenta of the particles which constitute the ball as 
the relevant initial conditions, without any specification of whether the coordinate system 
with 
respect 
to which 
they are given, 
is an inertial 
one.

11 Indeterministic laws which pick out a range of possible states without assigning probabil 
ities, are conceivable, 
so this is a special 
case. But 
it is a case which 
covers 
all indeterministic 
laws of which 
we 
have 
actual 
examples 
in science, 
and so it is the important 
one. 
12 It is a notoriously hard problem for all of the interpretations in this class to characterize 
measurement 
interactions 
precisely, 
but for the purposes 
of the discussion, 
we 
can assume 
the problem 
has a solution. 
13 Here is how this characterization applies to some of the more familiar no-collapse inter 
pretations: on the Kochen/Healey/Dieks 
interpretations, the set of observables for which a 
composite 
(measured 
system 
+ measuring 
apparatus) 
system 
has values, 
over 
and above 

CURIE'S PRINCIPLE 189 
those of which it is in an eigenstate, is determined by the unique biorthogonal decomposi 
tion of the system's state (if such there be, i.e., if there is no degeneracy), and the values the 
system has for those observables is probabilistically determined by applying Born's rule 
to its ^-function. 
On 
the modal 
interpretation 
of van Fraassen, 
the additional 
observables 
are determined by the history of the combined system (whether they have just engaged 
in a measurement 
interaction 
and which 
observable 
was 
measured, 
under 
some 
precise 
physical 
characterization 
of the conditions 
under which 
these 
obtain), 
and ?as 
above ?the 
value 
those 
observables 
have 
are probabilistically 
determined 
by applying 
Born's 
rule 
to 
its ^-function. 
14 The 
role of non-linearity 
explains 
why 
all of the early 
examples 
come from 
fluid 
dynam 
ics. 
It is an 
interesting 
historical 
fact 
that although 
they were 
being 
investigated 
in close 
proximity 
to Curie, 
and close 
to the time he wrote 
the symmetry 
paper, 
neither 
he nor his 
colleagues appear to have considered them in the light of their symmetry properties. 
15 
'Commonly', 
here, means 
something 
like 
'in normal 
circumstances, 
with 
normal 
vision, 
with 
due attention 
and training, 
etc.'. 
16 
We 
can think of physical 
evolution, 
in fact, 
as precisely 
a process 
wherein 
hidden 
struc 
ture 
is made 
apparent. 
The 
distinction 
between 
hidden 
and apparent 
asymmetry 
is - 
as I 
understand 
it, and 
in terms more 
familiar 
than his own ? David 
Bohm's 
distinction 
between 
explicate and implicate order, and conceiving of evolution in these terms is to hin of it as 
what 
he refers 
to as explication 
of implicate 
order. 
17 If T 
is not a symmetry 
of B, 
then according 
to Curie's 
Principle, 
there 
is some 
parameter 
P 
which 
is not 
invariant 
under 
T, and 
is such 
that A\ 
-> 
B\, 
Ai 
-> 
TB\, 
and A 
and 
A! are distinguished by different values of P. If A and A' are not observationally distin 
guishable, 
P 
is a 'hidden 
variable'. 
Whenever 
we 
postulate 
hidden 
variables 
as the causes 
of differences 
in observable 
behavior, 
we 
assume 
that there exists 
a Curie-cause 
for some 
family 
of alternative 
events 
and 
derive 
the characteristic 
asymmetries 
of 
the postulated 
cause 
from 
those 
of the effect. 
It is generally 
accepted 
that postulated 
hidden 
parameters 
must 
be measurable, 
i.e. must 
have 
observable 
effects 
beyond 
the effect 
it is introduced 
to 
explain 
(e.g., 
on a measuring 
apparatus). 
Without 
such a constraint, 
the distinction 
between 
deterministic 
and 
indeterministically 
evolving 
systems 
becomes 
empirically 
empty, 
for we 
can postulate 
hidden 
differences 
wherever 
we 
observe 
hidden 
behavior. 
All of this suggests that the specifically theoretical aspect of scientific theorizing (inso 
far as it consists 
in choosing 
between 
models 
which 
embed 
the same empirical 
substructures 
but differ in their higher level theoretical structure) is just an application of Curie's Principle 
on a cosmic 
scale, 
for it is entirely 
a matter 
of deriving 
intrinsic 
asymmetries 
in a postulated 
Curie-cause 
(the underlying 
physical 
structure 
of the world) 
from 
asymmetries 
in its effect 
(the appearances), 
on the assumption 
that the former 
determines 
the latter.
