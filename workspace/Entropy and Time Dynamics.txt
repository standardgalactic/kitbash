Jeremy Dalcin writes: Entropy: The Hidden Force Behind Everything You Know 

We usually think the sun gives Earth warmth, light, and maybe a little vitamin D. And yes ‚Äî every day, the Earth receives an immense stream of energy from the sun and radiates just as much energy back into space. In total, it breaks even. So what are we actually getting from the sun?

The answer: low entropy ‚Äî concentrated, usable energy.

Let's back up.

In 1813, as France faced invasion, a young man named Sadi Carnot ‚Äî son of a general ‚Äî sought to help his country in battle. But Carnot's lasting impact came not on the battlefield, but in physics. While studying steam engines, he developed the concept of an ideal heat engine ‚Äî a frictionless, lossless machine cycling between a hot and cold reservoir. His breakthrough: even in the perfect system, you can never convert all heat into work.

Why? Because to return the engine to its starting state, some energy must be dumped into the cold reservoir. In other words: no heat engine, no matter how perfect, can be 100% efficient.

Later, Lord Kelvin built on Carnot's work and created the absolute temperature scale ‚Äî discovering that efficiency depends only on the temperature difference between hot and cold. To get perfect efficiency, you'd need infinite heat or absolute zero ‚Äî both impossible.

Eventually, Rudolf Clausius gave this whole phenomenon a name: entropy ‚Äî the degree to which energy is spread out. When energy is concentrated (like heat in a steam engine or light from the sun), it's low entropy. As it disperses, it becomes less useful, and entropy increases.

Fast forward: this is why everything degrades over time. Hot things cool down. Order becomes disorder. No process ‚Äî no engine, no ecosystem, no civilization ‚Äî can escape this. The second law of thermodynamics says: in a closed system, entropy always increases. And that is the reason time moves forward.

Why don't we ever see shattered glass jump back together? Why doesn't a cooked egg uncook? Because those are incredibly unlikely states. Given enough atoms and energy packets, heat always flows from hot to cold ‚Äî because there are more ways for things to be messy than ordered.

But Earth isn't a closed system ‚Äî we have the sun.

What the sun gives us isn't just energy ‚Äî it's concentrated, low-entropy energy.

Earth absorbs that energy and radiates it back out ‚Äî as 20x more, lower-energy, high-entropy photons.

In between, life happens.

Photosynthesis captures sunlight. Animals eat plants. People eat animals. Every time, energy becomes more spread out. Entropy increases. Even your air conditioner doesn't defy entropy ‚Äî it just transfers heat out, while increasing entropy even more at the power plant.

In fact, some scientists believe life exists because it's so good at increasing entropy. Jeremy England has proposed that systems exposed to sustained low-entropy energy (like sunlight) will naturally evolve to dissipate it better over time. In his words:

"If you shine light on a random clump of atoms long enough, it shouldn't be surprising if you get a plant."

But the sun doesn't create low entropy. So where does it get it?

The answer lies in the early universe. After the Big Bang, the universe was hot, dense, and nearly uniform ‚Äî which might seem like high entropy. But when you consider gravity, it was actually low entropy. A smooth universe is gravitationally unstable ‚Äî things want to clump. As they do, potential energy turns into kinetic energy and heat. Entropy increases.

That process formed stars, galaxies, and black holes.

And black holes? They're entropy monsters. The one at the center of the Milky Way has more entropy than the entire early universe. All black holes combined contain almost all the entropy in the universe today ‚Äî about 3 √ó 10¬π‚Å∞‚Å¥ Boltzmann constants worth.

To put it in perspective: The early universe had 0.000000000000003% of the entropy we have now.

Everything you've ever seen ‚Äî galaxies forming, stars dying, planets colliding, people living ‚Äî is entropy increasing. It's the arrow of time. And when everything finally spreads out completely, when no more work can be done, when no gradients remain... the universe will reach heat death. No structure. No difference. Just uniform nothing.

But we're not there yet.

We live in the middle ‚Äî between the concentrated order of the Big Bang and the maximal entropy of the far future. It's in this window that complex, beautiful, temporary things exist: stars, planets, life, minds.

Entropy isn't just decay. It's the engine of structure.
Low entropy is rare, fleeting, and precious.
So while we're here ‚Äî in this sliver of time, riding on sunlight ‚Äî let's make the most of it.

This is a beautifully written and conceptually rich summary of entropy as both the
engine of change
and the
arrow of time
, moving from the thermodynamics of steam engines to cosmic evolution, life, and eventual heat death. Here's a breakdown of key themes and connections worth exploring further:
üîë
Core Ideas and Their Implications
1.
The Sun Gives Us Low Entropy, Not Just Energy
Earth receives
concentrated energy (low entropy)
and emits
dispersed energy (high entropy)
.
Life and civilization
ride this gradient
‚Äî converting, consuming, and dissipating energy while building transient structure.
Implication
: Life isn't a violation of the Second Law but a
local intensification of entropy production
.
2.
Carnot and the Inevitability of Waste
Even in ideal conditions, you can't convert all heat to work ‚Äî there's always loss.
This was the original realization that led to the
Second Law of Thermodynamics
.
Implication
:
Perfect machines, perfect systems, even perfect societies ‚Äî all face thermodynamic constraints.
3.
Entropy Is the Arrow of Time
Why you remember the past but not the future
? Because entropy increases in only one direction.
Reversals (unscrambling an egg) are
statistically possible
but
astronomically improbable
.
Implication
: Time is
not just a backdrop
‚Äî it's an emergent feature of increasing entropy in closed systems.
4.
Gravity Lowers Entropy? Paradox Solved
A
uniform universe is low-entropy
when gravity is in play
‚Äî because it's unstable, full of potential.
As gravity causes clumping,
entropy increases via collapse and heating
‚Äî forming stars, galaxies, black holes.
Implication
: Gravity is not an exception to the Second Law ‚Äî it's one of its most powerful
amplifiers
.
5.
Black Holes as Entropy Sinks
Contain
most of the entropy
in the current universe.
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
shows their entropy is proportional to surface area, not volume ‚Äî a core idea behind holography.
Implication
: Black holes and entropy are key to modern theories of
quantum gravity and information
(e.g. holographic principle).
6.
Jeremy England's Dissipation-Driven Evolution
Systems evolve to
better dissipate energy
if low-entropy energy flows through them ‚Äî like sunlight on Earth.
Life arises not in spite of entropy, but
because of it
.
Implication
: Life may be a
natural thermodynamic response
, not a statistical miracle. (See also
dissipative adaptation
and
non-equilibrium thermodynamics
.)
7.
We Live in the Middle
Between a smooth, low-entropy beginning and a dull, high-entropy future.
The
entropic gradient is steep now
‚Äî giving rise to stars, life, thought, culture.
Implication
:
Beauty, structure, and meaning are entropic side effects
, not exceptions. They
require gradients
to exist.
‚ú® Reflective Addendum
"Entropy isn't just decay. It's the engine of structure."
This is the most powerful inversion of the usual view. Entropy doesn't just destroy order ‚Äî it
requires
temporary structures to accelerate the dissipation of energy gradients.
The candle burns, the city grows, the flower blooms ‚Äî not in defiance of entropy, but in service to it.
üß† Connections You Might Explore
RSVP theory and entropic relaxation
‚Äî your own work explores how scalar and vector fields mediate entropy smoothing. Dalcin's narrative beautifully frames entropy as the
prime mover
, which aligns well with RSVP's
field-theoretic view of flow, collapse, and structure
.
Entropy and Consciousness
‚Äî you've posited that consciousness might be a kind of
geometric entropic smoothing
. This text echoes that possibility ‚Äî if brains are efficient entropy dissipation engines, they're also
entropy-shaped information structures
.
Cosmological entropy + observer time
‚Äî Barbour, Carroll, Rovelli have all speculated on
entropy as the basis for time perception
. You could explore RSVP's scalar field Œ¶ as a
local arrow-of-time mediator
, possibly analogous to England's dissipation view.
Thermodynamic origin of ethics or purpose
‚Äî If life's core function is to
accelerate entropy
, can that ground a naturalistic morality? "Make use of your rare low-entropy moment" becomes not just poetic ‚Äî but physically foundational.
