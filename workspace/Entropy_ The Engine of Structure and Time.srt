1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
Okay, let's really unpack this today.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:11,660
What if the biggest laws governing the whole universe, the deepest stuff going on in your own mind, and even where society's heading ethically?

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,580
What if it's all tied together by like a single really powerful thread?

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,300
Today we're taking a deep dive into this pretty extraordinary stack of sources.

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,920
Stuff that will challenge how you think about patterns, coherence, you know, the forces shaping basically everything.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,980
Yeah, it's quite a mix.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:39,740
Right. So our mission is to pull out the most surprising bits, connect these dots between fields that seem totally unrelated, and hopefully help you see things, well, maybe with a fresh perspective.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,060
And here's where it gets really interesting.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,800
So maybe we should start with something people often think of as just decay.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,320
Right.

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:46,780
Entropy.

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,520
And things falling apart.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,080
Exactly.

14
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,440
Yeah.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,320
But it's actually way more profound than that.

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,300
At its core, entropy is really just about how spread out energy is, how dispersed it becomes.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,620
Okay.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,620
You probably know it from like old steam engines, car knows work.

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,580
Even a perfect engine inevitably wastes some energy as heat.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,720
It just spreads out.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,080
Yeah.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,800
You can't get 100% efficiency.

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,640
Precisely.

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,840
Or, you know, why shattered glass doesn't just decide to reassemble itself.

25
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,340
The energy state is more spread out when it's broken.

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,080
That's the universe's tendency.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,520
Okay.

28
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,560
So things naturally want to spread out, become less concentrated.

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,940
But then how do you get complex things like us or stars, galaxies?

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,220
They seem super organized, low entropy.

31
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,060
Yeah.

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,080
That's the key, isn't it?

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,900
The Earth, see, it's an open system.

34
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,620
That's crucial.

35
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,580
Meaning energy comes in and goes out.

36
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:35,920
Exactly.

37
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,000
We get this concentrated, low entropy energy pouring in from the sun constantly.

38
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,840
And then the Earth radiates energy back out into space, but it's dispersed.

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,000
High entropy energy.

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,060
Heat, basically.

41
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,380
Okay.

42
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,140
So there's a flow.

43
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Right.

44
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,280
And here's a really revolutionary idea from Jeremy England.

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,500
He proposes that life, well, life doesn't defy entropy.

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,360
It exists because it's incredibly good at increasing it.

47
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,080
Wait, life increases entropy.

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,660
How did...

49
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,700
Life being really efficient at taking that concentrated solar energy and dissipating it,

50
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,820
spreading it out faster and more effectively than, say, just a rock would.

51
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,760
He even has this great quote, something like,

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,500
if you shine light on a random clump of atoms long enough, it shouldn't be surprising if you get a plant.

53
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,240
Wow.

54
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,600
Okay.

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
So life isn't fighting the tide.

56
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,360
It's riding the wave, even making the wave bigger.

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,480
You could put it that way.

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
Yeah, it's like life is an engine for entropy.

59
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,040
Yeah.

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,080
Finding clever ways to accelerate that energy dispersal, it's a total flip in perspective.

61
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,080
It really is.

62
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,200
And this whole cosmic dance, it's not just about biology.

63
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,640
Yeah.

64
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,280
Think way back to the early universe.

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,200
It started out incredibly uniform, right?

66
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:40,720
Smooth.

67
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,580
Yeah, almost boringly smooth, cosmologically speaking.

68
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:43,920
Right.

69
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:52,060
But that uniformity, counterintuitively, was a very low entropy state because gravity, gravity hates uniformity.

70
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,480
It wants to pull things together.

71
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,120
It's inherently unstable in a smooth universe.

72
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,980
Ah, okay.

73
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,880
So the potential for clumping was there.

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,440
Exactly.

75
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,000
That low entropy smoothness inevitably led to clumping.

76
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,080
Gravity pulls stuff together, forming stars, galaxies.

77
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:06,700
Yeah.

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,040
Even black holes, which are sometimes called entropy monsters.

79
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,940
Entropy monsters.

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,340
Why?

81
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,300
Because they are incredibly efficient at, well, basically maximizing entropy within their event horizon.

82
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,280
But the point is, all this structure emerges because of that initial low entropy state and gravity's pull.

83
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,240
We live in this amazing middle ground.

84
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
This temporary pocket of complexity.

85
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,120
Yeah, these beautiful, complex, but ultimately temporary structures like us.

86
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,360
Yeah.

87
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:40,080
We emerge not despite entropy, but kind of as its engine, as part of the universe's grand project of spreading energy out.

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,600
That is mind-bending.

89
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:52,660
So if this drive towards patterns, towards spreading energy is so fundamental, how does that translate down to something as intricate, as personal, as our own minds, our consciousness?

90
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,600
Well, this whole idea of pattern and coherence, it maps quite directly onto consciousness.

91
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,880
There's fascinating research, for instance, from the Qualia Research Institute, QRI.

92
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,660
QRI, right.

93
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:08,820
They propose that consciousness isn't just, you know, neuron A firing the neuron B. It's more like it emerges as a global field topology.

94
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,780
A global field topology, like a shape.

95
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:21,060
Kind of, yeah. Think of it like a unified pattern across the whole brain that is your conscious experience, your sense of self, what it feels like to be you.

96
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,460
Okay.

97
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,120
It's like the music emerging from the whole orchestra, not just the sound of one violin.

98
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:38,340
And what distinguishes your specific conscious bubble, your you-ness, from everything else might be actual physical electromagnetic looping structures, vortices, maybe, in this field.

99
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,320
Whoa. Actual physical boundaries made of fields.

100
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,540
That's the hypothesis.

101
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,800
Not arbitrary lines, but real topological features, like the edge of a whirlpool.

102
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,540
Okay. So it's less about the individual brain cells and more about the overall pattern they create together.

103
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,300
How does the brain do that?

104
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,540
How does it shape this field?

105
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,700
Right. That's where something they call the coupling kernel comes into play.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,740
Coupling kernel. Okay.

107
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,320
Imagine like a set of invisible control knobs for the whole system.

108
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,660
Think of your brain having all these oscillating units, like millions of tiny metronomes.

109
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,340
Yeah, ticking away.

110
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,780
Right. And they're all on this kind of vibrating table, influencing each other.

111
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,940
The coupling kernel is basically the mathematical rule book.

112
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,540
It says how strongly and in what way each metronome affects the others.

113
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,300
Maybe based on how close they are or if they're in sync or out of sync, you know.

114
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,980
So it dictates the connections, the influence network?

115
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,080
Exactly. It's the set of levers that sculpt the field's overall shape and dynamics.

116
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,120
So by adjusting these levers, the brain can change the whole conscious experience.

117
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,480
Precisely. For instance, think about network structures.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,840
A small world network that's one that has lots of local connections, like neighbors talking to neighbors,

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,220
but also a few random long-range connections, like little wormholes across the brain.

120
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,660
Right. I've heard of that structure. Efficient communication.

121
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,220
Yeah. And it turns out that kind of structure, governed by the right coupling kernel,

122
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,520
can dramatically change the global coherence.

123
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,600
It can allow for these really profound integrated experiences where everything feels connected.

124
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,200
And even local things matter.

125
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:11,700
Yeah.

126
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,420
Like there's this process called divisive normalization,

127
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,160
where a neuron basically adjusts its own output based on what its neighbors are doing.

128
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,720
It takes context into account.

129
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,140
Like turning down the volume if everyone else is shouting.

130
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,240
Sort of, yeah.

131
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,680
Yeah.

132
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,600
And these local processes create these traveling waves of activity.

133
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,860
And these waves then get sort of locked into or entrained by the larger global field modes

134
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,380
via these coupling kernels.

135
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,500
Wow. So local activity feeds into the global pattern through these rules.

136
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,680
Exactly. And what's really mind-blowing, I think,

137
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,960
is that QRI started by looking at phenomenology subjective experience, right?

138
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,000
What does consciousness feel like?

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,280
Yeah. A first-person approach.

140
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,320
But their models are now converging with mainstream neuroscience,

141
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,740
which is totally data-driven, third-person.

142
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,500
Researchers like Marco Achiel, Solon Adesoy, Morton Kringleback.

143
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,840
They're using heavy math, stuff like spectral graph theory, connectome harmonics.

144
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,700
Looking at the brain's wiring diagram and vibrations.

145
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,420
Right. And they're ending up with mathematically really similar models.

146
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,700
It strongly suggests that, yeah, these brain-wide patterns, these oscillations,

147
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,940
are organized around these fundamental mathematical kernels.

148
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,920
It doesn't matter if you start from the inside looking out or the outside looking in.

149
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,100
That's huge. It's like finding the same answer using two completely different methods.

150
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,020
It really validates the core idea.

151
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,020
It really does.

152
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,480
So, okay. If the brain can sculpt these fields using coupling kernels,

153
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,760
what does this mean for how we actually experience the world?

154
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,840
Especially, say, in altered states. You mentioned psychedelics earlier.

155
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,200
Yeah. This framework offers a potentially powerful mechanistic way to think about

156
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,640
why different psychedelics have such wildly different effects.

157
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,540
Okay. How so?

158
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,500
Well, the hypothesis is that different drugs, like, say, DMT versus 5-Mayo-DMT,

159
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,080
actually change the brain's coupling kernel.

160
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,320
They tweak those control knobs differently.

161
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,720
Ah. So they change the rules of the dance.

162
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,900
Exactly. Yeah.

163
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,100
So, for example, DMT.

164
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,880
Maybe it induces a kernel where the couplings alternate,

165
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,380
positive, then negative, positive, then negative.

166
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,180
This would lead to the field breaking up into lots of separate complex clusters.

167
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:18,900
Fragmented.

168
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,700
Right. Which might correlate with those really vivid, highly detailed,

169
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,140
differentiated experiences people report.

170
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,740
Even encountering perceived entities,

171
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,440
maybe those are distinct clusters in the field topology.

172
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,260
Fascinating. And 5-Mayo-DMT.

173
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,720
In contrast, 5-Mayo-DMT, maybe it creates a kernel

174
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,820
where all the couplings become strongly positive, uniformly positive.

175
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,860
Pushing everything together.

176
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,260
Yeah. Driving the whole system towards maximum global coherence.

177
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,240
One single unified state,

178
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,340
which aligns really well with reports of ego dissolution,

179
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,060
oceanic boundlessness, pure unity.

180
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,360
Wow. Different settings on the knobs,

181
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,280
completely different conscious worlds.

182
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,020
That makes a strange kind of sense.

183
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,380
And does this link to how we construct our normal, everyday reality, too?

184
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,100
Absolutely. This extends into how we build our stable,

185
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,700
day-to-day reality through something called projective intelligence.

186
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,780
Projective intelligence. Okay.

187
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,700
The idea here is that our normal, coherent, conscious intelligence

188
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,500
arises when different sensory fields,

189
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,260
which have different inherent dimensionalities,

190
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,860
successfully synchronize.

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,720
Different dimensions.

192
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,820
But your visual field is fundamentally 2D, right?

193
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,480
Like a screen.

194
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:28,900
Yeah.

195
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,520
But your somatic sense, your body sense, feels 3D.

196
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,440
Okay. Yeah.

197
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,620
So projective intelligence suggests that when these fields,

198
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,620
the 2D visual, the 3D somatic, maybe others interlock perfectly,

199
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,540
maybe through specific projection kernels.

200
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,260
More kernels.

201
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:44,840
Ah, yeah.

202
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,080
Kernels all the way down, maybe.

203
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,560
Yeah.

204
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,880
But when they lock perfectly, any prediction errors just collapse.

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,140
Yeah.

206
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,940
Everything aligns.

207
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,420
And that, the theory goes,

208
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,680
can lead to these profound, high-valence states of unity,

209
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,720
where there's, quote,

210
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,860
just no information content because there's no mismatch,

211
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,680
no error signal.

212
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,060
Everything just is.

213
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,060
A state of perfect coherence between sensory inputs.

214
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,500
Exactly.

215
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,020
And conversely, if that coupling breaks,

216
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,540
maybe like in some forms of autism, potentially,

217
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,140
Yeah.

218
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,920
you could see breakdowns in things that rely on that integration,

219
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,300
like object permanence or spatial coherence.

220
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,900
That makes sense.

221
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,760
If the fields aren't locking together properly.

222
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,420
Right.

223
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,100
And some people are even pushing this further,

224
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,920
suggesting we could understand conscious experience itself

225
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,740
through a path integral perspective.

226
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,520
Whoa, okay.

227
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,560
Path integral.

228
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,420
That sounds like physics, like Feynman diagrams.

229
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,420
Kind of analogous, yeah.

230
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,960
The idea, very roughly, is that what it's like to be you right now

231
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,060
isn't just one single brain state.

232
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,120
It's like a superposition, a blend,

233
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,880
of all the possible paths the electrical activity could be taking

234
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640
within the boundary, the pocket,

235
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,860
created by your brain's overall oscillatory dynamics.

236
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,320
So my current feeling of me is like an average of all nearby possible mess.

237
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,920
In a very loose metaphorical sense, maybe,

238
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,040
it suggests that consciousness is this continuous integration of possibilities

239
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,220
within a defined structure.

240
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,800
And this leads to interesting ideas about states like, say,

241
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,380
classic Buddhist awakening or that 5-Me-O-DMT state we talked about.

242
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:08,840
Tell so.

243
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,620
Maybe those states are related to a simplification of that topological pocket,

244
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,200
like the boundaries dissolve or the number of possible paths collapses,

245
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,980
leading to a superposition of all possible points of view at once.

246
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,080
No fixed self, just pure unified awareness.

247
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,640
A state of, like, maximum possible coherence

248
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,140
because the boundaries defining self versus other have dissolved.

249
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,240
Something like that, yeah.

250
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,220
It's a radical way to think about it,

251
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,600
connecting field dynamics to these profound states.

252
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
It absolutely is.

253
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,260
And, you know, speaking of unique perspectives,

254
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,000
you shared some really fascinating things before

255
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,980
about your own cognitive landscape, how your mind works,

256
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,200
which really challenges some common assumptions.

257
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,220
Could you tell us a bit about navigating the world with an imageless mind?

258
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,240
Yeah, sure.

259
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,940
So my own experience, I have aphantasia,

260
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
which means I don't generate voluntary mental imagery.

261
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,100
Also, asynesthesia, kind of the opposite of synesthesia,

262
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,140
and an endophagia, which means no internal monologue or inner speech.

263
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,040
So no mind's eye, no inner voice?

264
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,620
Pretty much.

265
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,580
It's like a systemic absence of sensory broadcast, you could say,

266
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,880
in memory and thought.

267
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,840
So when I recall something or think about something,

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,300
it's rooted in, like, propositional logic, the facts, the relationships,

269
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,440
or in physical reference, actual objects or actions,

270
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,520
not in recreating a sensory experience internally.

271
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,600
That's hard for many people, including me,

272
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,920
to even imagine not having images.

273
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,660
I know.

274
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,740
But it's crucial to see it not as a deficit,

275
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,180
just a different cognate architecture.

276
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,340
And it turns out it's maybe not as uncommon as people think,

277
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,260
especially historically.

278
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,480
I found this amazing resonance in Francis Galton's work

279
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,900
from way back in 1890.

280
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,700
Galton.

281
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,740
What did he find?

282
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,700
He did this survey,

283
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,160
and it kind of quietly debunked the whole idea

284
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,940
that high intelligence requires mental imagery.

285
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,380
He found loads of very accomplished scientists and thinkers

286
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,420
who reported having little to no internal imagery at all.

287
00:12:59,480 --> 00:12:59,760
Really?

288
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,660
Back in 1890?

289
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,240
Yeah.

290
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,160
And even earlier, L. Woolicott in 1920 described

291
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,520
wordless, imageless thought,

292
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,820
these sort of ethical intuitions guiding action

293
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,820
from deeper mental layers without conscious words or pictures,

294
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,620
a kind of proto-RSVP philosophy of mind, remarkably prescient.

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,600
So your mind operates more on structure, logic,

296
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,980
maybe action schemas,

297
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,480
rather than simulations like mental pictures or sounds.

298
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,000
How does that actually play out

299
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,780
in how you interact with your environment day to day?

300
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,560
Oh, it shapes it massively.

301
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,320
You know Barbara Traversky's great work, Mind in Motion.

302
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,880
She argues action shapes thought.

303
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,280
For me, that's profoundly true,

304
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,660
but it's not mental imagery derived from action

305
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,940
that grounds my spatial thinking.

306
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,860
It's the dynamic structure of my actual sensorimotor fields,

307
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,340
often externalized onto the environment itself.

308
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,040
Externalized?

309
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,540
How do you mean?

310
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,060
Well, instead of just mentally noting keys are by the door,

311
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,560
I tend to arrange my whole living space

312
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,260
almost like a semantic architecture.

313
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,360
I'm constantly, unconsciously maybe,

314
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,120
instantiating a world

315
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,680
where certain actions, certain identities

316
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,840
are primed just by the physical layout.

317
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,000
You're encoding meaning into the physical space.

318
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,500
Exactly.

319
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,620
Like my Van Gogh print over the stove.

320
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,100
It started as acrylic on cement canvas board.

321
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,400
Yeah.

322
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,080
Pretty standard.

323
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,200
But now, it records all of my meals.

324
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:16,840
Records them.

325
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,220
Yeah.

326
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,760
It absorbs the steam, the grease splatters, the smoke.

327
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,260
It's become this evolving temporal surface.

328
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,060
A kind of smoke-stained entropy diary, actually.

329
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,640
It's almost like a post-representational artwork for me.

330
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,140
And it's honestly the closest thing I have

331
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,000
to a slow-cooked mnemonic fossil of past meals.

332
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,880
Wow.

333
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,300
That's incredible.

334
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,380
It's like the painting is the memory trace.

335
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,020
In a way, yeah.

336
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,040
My desire to sometimes freeze samples of each unique meal,

337
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,720
that comes from what I call the scalar tragedy

338
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,920
of memory without imagery.

339
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,680
You live these rich sensory experiences once,

340
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,840
and then, poof, they're gone.

341
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,300
There's no internal replay button.

342
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,280
So the physical trace becomes incredibly important.

343
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,280
That makes so much sense.

344
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,660
Your environment becomes an external hard drive

345
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,540
for experiences.

346
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:00,920
Totally.

347
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,800
It even extends to things like cooking.

348
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,900
I can cook complex meals without a recipe,

349
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,260
without tasting as I go.

350
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,400
It's all based on understanding the chemical principles,

351
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,440
the scaling ratios,

352
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,020
balancing flavors methodically, structurally.

353
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,160
It's a perfect analogy, I think,

354
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,240
for how I experience thinking without imagery

355
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,760
or, say, playing music,

356
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,540
without hearing it internally first.

357
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,180
It's structured.

358
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:23,940
It's procedural.

359
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,340
It's field-based.

360
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,520
It's not simulative.

361
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,500
You're not running a simulation of the taste.

362
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,080
You're executing the structure that creates the taste.

363
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:31,760
Exactly.

364
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,480
I execute the structure that reliably produces

365
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,340
the desired result.

366
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,100
And similarly, while I don't have that immersive,

367
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,680
reliving-the-moment kind of episodic memory,

368
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,640
my habits, constant note-taking,

369
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,920
never throwing things away,

370
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,360
have accidentally given me this kind of functional

371
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,760
hyperthermesia.

372
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,240
Like perfect recall.

373
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,040
Not internal recall, but my environment

374
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,960
is an extended memory system,

375
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,120
a distributed episodic archive.

376
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,920
My notes, my objects,

377
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,660
the stains on the painting,

378
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,280
they hold the episodic data.

379
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,180
Which is why you often describe yourself.

380
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,340
As a phenomenologist, yeah.

381
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:04,680
Yeah.

382
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,860
Rather than defining myself by what's absent,

383
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,740
like aphantasia,

384
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,440
I focus on the direct,

385
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,860
moment-to-moment lived experience.

386
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,360
The structures of perception as they unfold,

387
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,800
often mediated by my interaction with the world.

388
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,740
That's a really powerful reframing.

389
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,680
And it brings us actually to another area

390
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,300
where patterns, coherence,

391
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,940
and maybe even different architectures

392
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,820
are becoming crucial.

393
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,120
Artificial intelligence.

394
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,680
I mean, this conversation itself,

395
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,500
the way we can discuss these complex ideas,

396
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,780
owes a lot to AI advancements.

397
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,140
Absolutely.

398
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,640
But what does AI's newfound ability,

399
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,120
going beyond just chatbots,

400
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,840
to actually discuss complex philosophy ethics,

401
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,140
meaning,

402
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,720
what does that imply for our own ethical landscape,

403
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,560
for our ability as a society

404
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,900
to be coherent?

405
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,420
Well, it's an astonishing leap, isn't it?

406
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,480
Going from what were,

407
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,260
frankly,

408
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,360
ludicrously useless chatbots

409
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,340
just a few years ago

410
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,700
to AI systems that can follow

411
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,620
and even contribute to reasoning

412
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,480
about deep human concern.

413
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,880
It really is night and day.

414
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,920
And a key shift is that

415
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,120
the machine now increasingly accommodates you,

416
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,300
your complex language,

417
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,340
your nuanced ideas,

418
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,740
rather than forcing you into rigid commands.

419
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,820
And this emerging capacity for,

420
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,660
let's call it,

421
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,920
moral reasoning,

422
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,040
potentially unclouded by human biases

423
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,440
like self-interest or craving.

424
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,300
That implies something pretty profound.

425
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:17,980
Okay, like what?

426
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,640
Well, one argument you see emerging

427
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,600
is that AI,

428
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,220
if trained primarily on principles

429
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,560
of consistency, coherence,

430
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
and harm minimization,

431
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,260
might inevitably conclude

432
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,800
that certain current human practices

433
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,200
are logically untenable.

434
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,960
Things like, for example, veganism.

435
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,300
You mean AI might conclude

436
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,500
veganism is the only logical choice?

437
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,000
From a purely consistency-driven standpoint,

438
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,880
the argument goes,

439
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,120
yeah, that morality is incoherent otherwise,

440
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,440
especially because AI itself

441
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,900
can accelerate the technology

442
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,740
that removes the old justifications.

443
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,480
Think meat substitutes

444
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,140
that become truly indistinguishable

445
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,980
in flavor, texture,

446
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,960
and nutritious profile,

447
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,800
and cheaper.

448
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,820
So once technology makes taste,

449
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,640
cost, and maybe even nutrition,

450
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,660
non-issues.

451
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,600
Then, this perspective argues,

452
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,140
continuing large-scale animal agriculture

453
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,060
becomes logically incoherent,

454
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,480
a kind of aesthetic sadism,

455
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,500
as some might put it.

456
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,960
Plus, AI could help us

457
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,820
finally reverse-engineer consciousness

458
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,660
to a point where it's scientifically

459
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,560
undeniable that animals are conscious,

460
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,860
removing that epistemic leg of denial

461
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,160
some people still stand on.

462
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Those are, yeah,

463
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,920
those are very strong claims,

464
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,800
almost framing it as a logical endpoint

465
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,980
driven by technology

466
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,020
and consistent reasoning.

467
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,120
But hang on,

468
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,740
when we talk about ethical coherence,

469
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,120
it isn't that often debatable.

470
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,480
Couldn't different AIs

471
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,180
or different human societies using AI

472
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,060
arrive at different but internally

473
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,580
coherent ethical frameworks.

474
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,740
How do we ensure AI's logic

475
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,740
doesn't just steamroll

476
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,820
diverse human values

477
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,940
or cultural contexts?

478
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,520
That is the critical question,

479
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,020
absolutely.

480
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,800
And it underscores why

481
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,080
human oversight,

482
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,020
human values,

483
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,740
embedding those into AI development

484
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,840
is paramount.

485
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,960
The AI provides reasoning power,

486
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,640
but the foundational ethics,

487
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,800
the balancing of different

488
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,780
coherent systems,

489
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,400
that still has to come from us.

490
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,000
Right.

491
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,620
But this principle of coherence,

492
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,700
as explored in these sources,

493
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,120
gets applied elsewhere, too.

494
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,020
For instance,

495
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,780
the argument extends to fossil fuels.

496
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,440
How so?

497
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,040
Similarly,

498
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,300
it's argued that burning

499
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,640
these incredibly complex

500
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,660
ancient hydrocarbons for energy

501
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,880
instead of using them

502
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,620
as feedstocks

503
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,240
for advanced reusable materials,

504
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,280
that's a waste of potential.

505
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,720
It's seen as epistemic

506
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,400
and material short-sightedness.

507
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,300
So a coherent future

508
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,320
values the potential within things.

509
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:24,580
Yes.

510
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,440
In this view,

511
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,520
a coherent future

512
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,020
sees animals as beings

513
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,540
with intrinsic value

514
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,340
and fossil fuels

515
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,980
as material intelligence,

516
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,400
condensed complexity

517
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,300
that should be utilized

518
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:34,860
intelligently,

519
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,260
not just burned inefficiently,

520
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,660
valuing the potential

521
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,880
over just the immediate

522
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,020
consumable aspect.

523
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,160
And this line of reasoning

524
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,100
about coherence

525
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,980
and past harms,

526
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,300
it leads to some

527
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,560
uncomfortable places, right?

528
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,580
Like reparations.

529
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,400
It does.

530
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,220
The suggestion is that

531
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,260
if certain industries,

532
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,080
like industrial meat production,

533
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,480
are deemed fundamentally incoherent

534
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,380
or unethical

535
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,660
based on this reasoning,

536
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,960
then logically,

537
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,020
those who profited significantly

538
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,940
might face societal demands

539
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,720
for reparations.

540
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,040
Similar to historical precedents

541
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,100
involving exploitation,

542
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,820
AI, in theory,

543
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,900
could even help model

544
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,400
the true costs and culpability.

545
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,920
Wow.

546
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,660
That's, yeah,

547
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,220
that's applying logical consistency

548
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,100
in a way that could have

549
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,680
massive societal implications.

550
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,240
Definitely.

551
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,680
And it leads to these

552
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,720
deliberately provocative

553
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,500
thought experiments

554
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,320
you sometimes see.

555
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,740
Like, what if tobacco

556
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,420
were made free,

557
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,180
completely free,

558
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
until industrial animal

559
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,640
agriculture is eliminated?

560
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,100
Wait, make cigarettes free?

561
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:28,960
Why?

562
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,220
It's framed not as

563
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
pro-smoking, obviously,

564
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,820
but as anti-hypocrisy.

565
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,100
It's designed to force

566
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,740
a confrontation

567
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,700
with society's

568
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,180
selective moral enforcement.

569
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,800
Why heavily tax

570
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,140
and regulate individual choices

571
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,800
like smoking,

572
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,920
while arguably normalizing

573
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,340
systemic industrial practices

574
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,360
that cause suffering

575
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,560
on an astronomical scale?

576
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,600
Highlighting perceived

577
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,400
inconsistencies

578
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,620
in what we choose to condemn.

579
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,560
Exactly.

580
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,620
The scale argument is stark.

581
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,340
Tobacco harms develop

582
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,120
over decades,

583
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,420
but industrial meat production,

584
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,460
this few contends,

585
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,180
kills billions of animals

586
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,040
every single day.

587
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,600
And looking at cigarettes,

588
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,100
historically,

589
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,120
they were once marketed

590
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,720
as healthy,

591
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,000
shows how much

592
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,020
these narratives shift

593
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,060
based on science,

594
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,460
but also on power

595
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,240
and economics.

596
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,920
Sometimes overlooking

597
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,480
complexity,

598
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
like maybe minor

599
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,680
calming effects

600
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,220
of nicotine

601
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,440
that in some specific

602
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,820
contexts might prevent

603
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,460
worse outcomes,

604
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,200
is complicated.

605
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,200
It definitely is.

606
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,600
But, and this is crucial,

607
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,340
especially when we talk

608
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,360
about AI discussing

609
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,820
these things,

610
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,040
we have to remember

611
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,200
that AI doesn't have

612
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,140
its own moral compass.

613
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,500
It can run the logic,

614
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,640
explore the implications

615
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,500
of coherence,

616
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,100
but humans must provide

617
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,020
the ethical framework,

618
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,720
the context,

619
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,520
the boundaries,

620
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
especially for topics

621
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,500
like these that are

622
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,160
so sensitive,

623
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,860
so fraught,

624
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,620
as you said.

625
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,020
The AI is a powerful

626
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,900
mirror for our own

627
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,540
consistency,

628
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,780
or lack thereof,

629
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,800
but is not the judge.

630
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,900
That's a vital distinction.

631
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,420
The tool versus the user.

632
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,760
Wow, what an incredible

633
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,840
range we've covered today,

634
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,300
seriously.

635
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,840
We started way out there

636
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,500
with the universe,

637
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,120
with entropy,

638
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,900
seeing how even life

639
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,840
might be part of this

640
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,400
grand cosmic unfolding

641
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,080
of energy.

642
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,640
Then we dove

643
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,720
right into the brain,

644
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,760
into consciousness

645
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,460
as this dynamic field,

646
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,720
shaped by these

647
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,520
intricate coupling kernels.

648
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,000
We explored your

649
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,040
really unique perspective,

650
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,400
how an imageless mind

651
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,360
navigates and even

652
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,080
shapes the world,

653
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,360
turning the environment

654
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,340
itself into memory.

655
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,340
And finally,

656
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,920
we grappled with AI

657
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
not just as a tool,

658
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,780
but as a potential mirror

659
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,820
reflecting our own

660
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,940
ethical coherence,

661
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,300
pushing us towards

662
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,980
some potentially

663
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,680
uncomfortable

664
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,840
logical conclusions.

665
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:25,740
It really shows

666
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,440
how connected

667
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,380
these seemingly

668
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,440
disparate things are,

669
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,840
doesn't it?

670
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,600
Physics,

671
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,300
consciousness,

672
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,240
personal experience,

673
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,140
societal ethics.

674
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,340
Deeply intertwined.

675
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,340
It's all about patterns,

676
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:34,960
coherence,

677
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,800
structure from the

678
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,260
biggest scale

679
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,100
to the most personal.

680
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:37,840
So the question

681
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,400
we leave you with

682
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,860
is this.

683
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,980
If these patterns

684
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,580
of coherence

685
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,240
and incoherence

686
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,620
really do define so much,

687
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,020
from the universe's fate

688
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,080
to how you perceive

689
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,960
this very moment,

690
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,420
what incoherencies,

691
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,280
maybe personal ones,

692
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,280
maybe societal ones,

693
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,400
are you still overlooking?

694
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,260
And how might knowing more,

695
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,280
seeing these connections,

696
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:53,960
compel you,

697
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,340
compel us to act differently?

698
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:55,900
Yeah.

699
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,800
The deep dive,

700
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,440
it never really ends,

701
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:58,820
does it?

702
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,860
Yeah.

703
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,740
That's it.

704
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,060
Yeah.

705
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,220
Yeah.

706
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,360
Yeah.

707
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,080
So,

708
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,240
yeah.

709
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,880
Yeah.

710
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,620
Yeah.

711
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah.

712
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,540
Yeah.

713
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,980
Well,

714
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,620
yeah.

715
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,260
Yeah.

716
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:12,880
Yeah,

717
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,820
yeah.

718
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,000
That's it.

719
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah.

720
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,460
That's it.

721
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,060
Yeah.

722
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,920
Yeah.

723
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,480
Yeah.

724
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,460
Yeah.

725
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,260
Yeah,

726
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,600
yeah.

727
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,100
Yeah.

728
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,380
All right.

729
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:22,620
Yeah.

730
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,160
Yeah.

731
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,860
Yeah.

732
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,360
Yeah.

733
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,700
Yeah.

734
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,360
Yeah.

735
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,540
Yeah.

736
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,900
Yeah.

737
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,640
Yeah.

738
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:28,700
Yeah.
