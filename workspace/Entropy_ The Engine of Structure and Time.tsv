0	1520	Okay, let's really unpack this today.
1640	11660	What if the biggest laws governing the whole universe, the deepest stuff going on in your own mind, and even where society's heading ethically?
12480	16580	What if it's all tied together by like a single really powerful thread?
17040	21300	Today we're taking a deep dive into this pretty extraordinary stack of sources.
21700	27920	Stuff that will challenge how you think about patterns, coherence, you know, the forces shaping basically everything.
28100	28980	Yeah, it's quite a mix.
28980	39740	Right. So our mission is to pull out the most surprising bits, connect these dots between fields that seem totally unrelated, and hopefully help you see things, well, maybe with a fresh perspective.
40020	42060	And here's where it gets really interesting.
42240	45800	So maybe we should start with something people often think of as just decay.
46080	46320	Right.
46460	46780	Entropy.
46840	47520	And things falling apart.
47700	48080	Exactly.
48260	48440	Yeah.
48560	50320	But it's actually way more profound than that.
50580	56300	At its core, entropy is really just about how spread out energy is, how dispersed it becomes.
56400	56620	Okay.
56620	59620	You probably know it from like old steam engines, car knows work.
60260	64580	Even a perfect engine inevitably wastes some energy as heat.
64700	65720	It just spreads out.
65880	66080	Yeah.
66160	67800	You can't get 100% efficiency.
68160	68640	Precisely.
69060	72840	Or, you know, why shattered glass doesn't just decide to reassemble itself.
73100	75340	The energy state is more spread out when it's broken.
75780	77080	That's the universe's tendency.
77080	77520	Okay.
77660	80560	So things naturally want to spread out, become less concentrated.
80820	86940	But then how do you get complex things like us or stars, galaxies?
87040	89220	They seem super organized, low entropy.
89620	90060	Yeah.
90100	91080	That's the key, isn't it?
91300	92900	The Earth, see, it's an open system.
93120	93620	That's crucial.
93940	95580	Meaning energy comes in and goes out.
95580	95920	Exactly.
96040	100000	We get this concentrated, low entropy energy pouring in from the sun constantly.
100460	104840	And then the Earth radiates energy back out into space, but it's dispersed.
105060	106000	High entropy energy.
106280	107060	Heat, basically.
107180	107380	Okay.
107460	108140	So there's a flow.
108520	108800	Right.
109060	111280	And here's a really revolutionary idea from Jeremy England.
111780	115500	He proposes that life, well, life doesn't defy entropy.
115500	118360	It exists because it's incredibly good at increasing it.
118420	120080	Wait, life increases entropy.
120320	120660	How did...
120660	124700	Life being really efficient at taking that concentrated solar energy and dissipating it,
124860	128820	spreading it out faster and more effectively than, say, just a rock would.
129080	130760	He even has this great quote, something like,
131680	136500	if you shine light on a random clump of atoms long enough, it shouldn't be surprising if you get a plant.
136860	137240	Wow.
137420	137600	Okay.
137680	139360	So life isn't fighting the tide.
139500	143360	It's riding the wave, even making the wave bigger.
143520	144480	You could put it that way.
144480	146640	Yeah, it's like life is an engine for entropy.
146960	147040	Yeah.
147120	152080	Finding clever ways to accelerate that energy dispersal, it's a total flip in perspective.
152340	153080	It really is.
153100	156200	And this whole cosmic dance, it's not just about biology.
156440	156640	Yeah.
156740	158280	Think way back to the early universe.
158400	160200	It started out incredibly uniform, right?
160380	160720	Smooth.
160980	163580	Yeah, almost boringly smooth, cosmologically speaking.
163700	163920	Right.
164300	172060	But that uniformity, counterintuitively, was a very low entropy state because gravity, gravity hates uniformity.
172060	173480	It wants to pull things together.
173480	176120	It's inherently unstable in a smooth universe.
176440	176980	Ah, okay.
177160	178880	So the potential for clumping was there.
179120	179440	Exactly.
179960	183000	That low entropy smoothness inevitably led to clumping.
183460	186080	Gravity pulls stuff together, forming stars, galaxies.
186460	186700	Yeah.
187000	190040	Even black holes, which are sometimes called entropy monsters.
190220	190940	Entropy monsters.
191120	191340	Why?
191340	197300	Because they are incredibly efficient at, well, basically maximizing entropy within their event horizon.
197380	203280	But the point is, all this structure emerges because of that initial low entropy state and gravity's pull.
203440	206240	We live in this amazing middle ground.
206240	208240	This temporary pocket of complexity.
208500	212120	Yeah, these beautiful, complex, but ultimately temporary structures like us.
212200	212360	Yeah.
212520	220080	We emerge not despite entropy, but kind of as its engine, as part of the universe's grand project of spreading energy out.
220080	221600	That is mind-bending.
221600	232660	So if this drive towards patterns, towards spreading energy is so fundamental, how does that translate down to something as intricate, as personal, as our own minds, our consciousness?
232900	236600	Well, this whole idea of pattern and coherence, it maps quite directly onto consciousness.
236880	240880	There's fascinating research, for instance, from the Qualia Research Institute, QRI.
241040	241660	QRI, right.
241660	248820	They propose that consciousness isn't just, you know, neuron A firing the neuron B. It's more like it emerges as a global field topology.
248980	251780	A global field topology, like a shape.
252060	261060	Kind of, yeah. Think of it like a unified pattern across the whole brain that is your conscious experience, your sense of self, what it feels like to be you.
261180	261460	Okay.
261660	266120	It's like the music emerging from the whole orchestra, not just the sound of one violin.
266120	278340	And what distinguishes your specific conscious bubble, your you-ness, from everything else might be actual physical electromagnetic looping structures, vortices, maybe, in this field.
278580	282320	Whoa. Actual physical boundaries made of fields.
282660	283540	That's the hypothesis.
283920	288800	Not arbitrary lines, but real topological features, like the edge of a whirlpool.
288980	293540	Okay. So it's less about the individual brain cells and more about the overall pattern they create together.
293760	295300	How does the brain do that?
295300	296540	How does it shape this field?
296780	299700	Right. That's where something they call the coupling kernel comes into play.
300000	300740	Coupling kernel. Okay.
300800	304320	Imagine like a set of invisible control knobs for the whole system.
305100	309660	Think of your brain having all these oscillating units, like millions of tiny metronomes.
309680	310340	Yeah, ticking away.
310560	313780	Right. And they're all on this kind of vibrating table, influencing each other.
314120	316940	The coupling kernel is basically the mathematical rule book.
317140	321540	It says how strongly and in what way each metronome affects the others.
321540	326300	Maybe based on how close they are or if they're in sync or out of sync, you know.
326500	328980	So it dictates the connections, the influence network?
329320	335080	Exactly. It's the set of levers that sculpt the field's overall shape and dynamics.
335080	340120	So by adjusting these levers, the brain can change the whole conscious experience.
340340	343480	Precisely. For instance, think about network structures.
344000	348840	A small world network that's one that has lots of local connections, like neighbors talking to neighbors,
349000	353220	but also a few random long-range connections, like little wormholes across the brain.
353220	355660	Right. I've heard of that structure. Efficient communication.
355980	360220	Yeah. And it turns out that kind of structure, governed by the right coupling kernel,
360440	363520	can dramatically change the global coherence.
363700	369600	It can allow for these really profound integrated experiences where everything feels connected.
369900	371200	And even local things matter.
371560	371700	Yeah.
371800	374420	Like there's this process called divisive normalization,
374680	380160	where a neuron basically adjusts its own output based on what its neighbors are doing.
380260	381720	It takes context into account.
381720	384140	Like turning down the volume if everyone else is shouting.
384820	385240	Sort of, yeah.
385480	385680	Yeah.
385760	389600	And these local processes create these traveling waves of activity.
390040	395860	And these waves then get sort of locked into or entrained by the larger global field modes
395860	397380	via these coupling kernels.
397640	401500	Wow. So local activity feeds into the global pattern through these rules.
401700	403680	Exactly. And what's really mind-blowing, I think,
404040	407960	is that QRI started by looking at phenomenology subjective experience, right?
408700	410000	What does consciousness feel like?
410000	411280	Yeah. A first-person approach.
411720	414320	But their models are now converging with mainstream neuroscience,
414820	416740	which is totally data-driven, third-person.
417480	420500	Researchers like Marco Achiel, Solon Adesoy, Morton Kringleback.
420920	425840	They're using heavy math, stuff like spectral graph theory, connectome harmonics.
426180	428700	Looking at the brain's wiring diagram and vibrations.
428700	432420	Right. And they're ending up with mathematically really similar models.
432580	436700	It strongly suggests that, yeah, these brain-wide patterns, these oscillations,
436800	439940	are organized around these fundamental mathematical kernels.
440120	443920	It doesn't matter if you start from the inside looking out or the outside looking in.
443920	449100	That's huge. It's like finding the same answer using two completely different methods.
449100	451020	It really validates the core idea.
451020	452020	It really does.
452420	456480	So, okay. If the brain can sculpt these fields using coupling kernels,
456700	460760	what does this mean for how we actually experience the world?
460840	463840	Especially, say, in altered states. You mentioned psychedelics earlier.
463840	469200	Yeah. This framework offers a potentially powerful mechanistic way to think about
469200	472640	why different psychedelics have such wildly different effects.
472820	473540	Okay. How so?
473660	478500	Well, the hypothesis is that different drugs, like, say, DMT versus 5-Mayo-DMT,
478720	481080	actually change the brain's coupling kernel.
481380	483320	They tweak those control knobs differently.
483580	485720	Ah. So they change the rules of the dance.
486120	486900	Exactly. Yeah.
486960	488100	So, for example, DMT.
488680	491880	Maybe it induces a kernel where the couplings alternate,
491880	494380	positive, then negative, positive, then negative.
494380	498180	This would lead to the field breaking up into lots of separate complex clusters.
498580	498900	Fragmented.
499160	503700	Right. Which might correlate with those really vivid, highly detailed,
504140	506140	differentiated experiences people report.
506540	508740	Even encountering perceived entities,
509120	511440	maybe those are distinct clusters in the field topology.
511600	514260	Fascinating. And 5-Mayo-DMT.
514540	517720	In contrast, 5-Mayo-DMT, maybe it creates a kernel
517720	521820	where all the couplings become strongly positive, uniformly positive.
521940	522860	Pushing everything together.
523020	526260	Yeah. Driving the whole system towards maximum global coherence.
526540	528240	One single unified state,
528700	531340	which aligns really well with reports of ego dissolution,
531960	534060	oceanic boundlessness, pure unity.
534280	536360	Wow. Different settings on the knobs,
536520	538280	completely different conscious worlds.
538440	540020	That makes a strange kind of sense.
540440	544380	And does this link to how we construct our normal, everyday reality, too?
544620	547100	Absolutely. This extends into how we build our stable,
547220	549700	day-to-day reality through something called projective intelligence.
549820	550780	Projective intelligence. Okay.
550780	555700	The idea here is that our normal, coherent, conscious intelligence
555700	559500	arises when different sensory fields,
559660	562260	which have different inherent dimensionalities,
562640	563860	successfully synchronize.
564000	564720	Different dimensions.
565180	567820	But your visual field is fundamentally 2D, right?
567860	568480	Like a screen.
568680	568900	Yeah.
569140	572520	But your somatic sense, your body sense, feels 3D.
572740	573440	Okay. Yeah.
573440	576620	So projective intelligence suggests that when these fields,
577240	581620	the 2D visual, the 3D somatic, maybe others interlock perfectly,
581860	583540	maybe through specific projection kernels.
583600	584260	More kernels.
584380	584840	Ah, yeah.
584980	586080	Kernels all the way down, maybe.
586340	586560	Yeah.
586640	589880	But when they lock perfectly, any prediction errors just collapse.
590000	590140	Yeah.
590360	590940	Everything aligns.
591160	592420	And that, the theory goes,
592500	595680	can lead to these profound, high-valence states of unity,
595680	596720	where there's, quote,
596720	599860	just no information content because there's no mismatch,
599940	600680	no error signal.
600960	602060	Everything just is.
602180	605060	A state of perfect coherence between sensory inputs.
605180	605500	Exactly.
605880	608020	And conversely, if that coupling breaks,
608580	610540	maybe like in some forms of autism, potentially,
610960	611140	Yeah.
611240	613920	you could see breakdowns in things that rely on that integration,
614060	616300	like object permanence or spatial coherence.
616320	616900	That makes sense.
616960	618760	If the fields aren't locking together properly.
619180	619420	Right.
619420	621100	And some people are even pushing this further,
621540	623920	suggesting we could understand conscious experience itself
623920	625740	through a path integral perspective.
625940	626520	Whoa, okay.
626840	627560	Path integral.
628280	630420	That sounds like physics, like Feynman diagrams.
630620	631420	Kind of analogous, yeah.
631760	636960	The idea, very roughly, is that what it's like to be you right now
636960	639060	isn't just one single brain state.
639140	641120	It's like a superposition, a blend,
641120	644880	of all the possible paths the electrical activity could be taking
644880	646640	within the boundary, the pocket,
646640	649860	created by your brain's overall oscillatory dynamics.
650180	654320	So my current feeling of me is like an average of all nearby possible mess.
654560	656920	In a very loose metaphorical sense, maybe,
657500	661040	it suggests that consciousness is this continuous integration of possibilities
661040	662220	within a defined structure.
662440	664800	And this leads to interesting ideas about states like, say,
664880	668380	classic Buddhist awakening or that 5-Me-O-DMT state we talked about.
668460	668840	Tell so.
668840	672620	Maybe those states are related to a simplification of that topological pocket,
672840	676200	like the boundaries dissolve or the number of possible paths collapses,
676640	679980	leading to a superposition of all possible points of view at once.
680300	683080	No fixed self, just pure unified awareness.
683420	686640	A state of, like, maximum possible coherence
686640	691140	because the boundaries defining self versus other have dissolved.
691200	692240	Something like that, yeah.
692760	694220	It's a radical way to think about it,
694280	696600	connecting field dynamics to these profound states.
696800	697800	It absolutely is.
697800	700260	And, you know, speaking of unique perspectives,
701020	703000	you shared some really fascinating things before
703000	705980	about your own cognitive landscape, how your mind works,
705980	708200	which really challenges some common assumptions.
708640	713220	Could you tell us a bit about navigating the world with an imageless mind?
713880	714240	Yeah, sure.
714400	716940	So my own experience, I have aphantasia,
717200	719600	which means I don't generate voluntary mental imagery.
720160	723100	Also, asynesthesia, kind of the opposite of synesthesia,
723380	727140	and an endophagia, which means no internal monologue or inner speech.
727140	729040	So no mind's eye, no inner voice?
729180	729620	Pretty much.
729720	732580	It's like a systemic absence of sensory broadcast, you could say,
732980	733880	in memory and thought.
734320	736840	So when I recall something or think about something,
737000	740300	it's rooted in, like, propositional logic, the facts, the relationships,
740580	743440	or in physical reference, actual objects or actions,
743820	746520	not in recreating a sensory experience internally.
746680	748600	That's hard for many people, including me,
748640	750920	to even imagine not having images.
751320	751660	I know.
751820	753740	But it's crucial to see it not as a deficit,
753740	756180	just a different cognate architecture.
756400	759340	And it turns out it's maybe not as uncommon as people think,
759400	760260	especially historically.
760580	763480	I found this amazing resonance in Francis Galton's work
763480	764900	from way back in 1890.
765220	765700	Galton.
765940	766740	What did he find?
766960	767700	He did this survey,
767860	770160	and it kind of quietly debunked the whole idea
770160	772940	that high intelligence requires mental imagery.
773320	776380	He found loads of very accomplished scientists and thinkers
776380	779420	who reported having little to no internal imagery at all.
779480	779760	Really?
779920	780660	Back in 1890?
781060	781240	Yeah.
781240	784160	And even earlier, L. Woolicott in 1920 described
784160	786520	wordless, imageless thought,
787120	789820	these sort of ethical intuitions guiding action
789820	792820	from deeper mental layers without conscious words or pictures,
793340	797620	a kind of proto-RSVP philosophy of mind, remarkably prescient.
798000	800600	So your mind operates more on structure, logic,
800840	801980	maybe action schemas,
802040	804480	rather than simulations like mental pictures or sounds.
804820	806000	How does that actually play out
806000	807780	in how you interact with your environment day to day?
808000	809560	Oh, it shapes it massively.
809560	812320	You know Barbara Traversky's great work, Mind in Motion.
812780	814880	She argues action shapes thought.
815380	817280	For me, that's profoundly true,
817380	819660	but it's not mental imagery derived from action
819660	820940	that grounds my spatial thinking.
821260	824860	It's the dynamic structure of my actual sensorimotor fields,
825040	827340	often externalized onto the environment itself.
827480	828040	Externalized?
828160	828540	How do you mean?
828540	831060	Well, instead of just mentally noting keys are by the door,
831320	833560	I tend to arrange my whole living space
833560	836260	almost like a semantic architecture.
836500	838360	I'm constantly, unconsciously maybe,
838840	840120	instantiating a world
840120	842680	where certain actions, certain identities
842680	844840	are primed just by the physical layout.
844920	847000	You're encoding meaning into the physical space.
847080	847500	Exactly.
847660	849620	Like my Van Gogh print over the stove.
849700	852100	It started as acrylic on cement canvas board.
852220	852400	Yeah.
852520	853080	Pretty standard.
853080	856200	But now, it records all of my meals.
856420	856840	Records them.
857040	857220	Yeah.
857300	859760	It absorbs the steam, the grease splatters, the smoke.
860000	862260	It's become this evolving temporal surface.
862380	865060	A kind of smoke-stained entropy diary, actually.
865480	867640	It's almost like a post-representational artwork for me.
867960	870140	And it's honestly the closest thing I have
870140	873000	to a slow-cooked mnemonic fossil of past meals.
873360	873880	Wow.
874720	875300	That's incredible.
875420	877380	It's like the painting is the memory trace.
877380	878020	In a way, yeah.
878540	883040	My desire to sometimes freeze samples of each unique meal,
883440	885720	that comes from what I call the scalar tragedy
885720	886920	of memory without imagery.
887320	889680	You live these rich sensory experiences once,
889800	891840	and then, poof, they're gone.
892040	893300	There's no internal replay button.
893780	896280	So the physical trace becomes incredibly important.
896380	897280	That makes so much sense.
897360	899660	Your environment becomes an external hard drive
899660	900540	for experiences.
900680	900920	Totally.
901200	902800	It even extends to things like cooking.
903060	905900	I can cook complex meals without a recipe,
905900	907260	without tasting as I go.
908060	910400	It's all based on understanding the chemical principles,
910560	911440	the scaling ratios,
911960	914020	balancing flavors methodically, structurally.
914620	916160	It's a perfect analogy, I think,
916620	919240	for how I experience thinking without imagery
919240	920760	or, say, playing music,
920900	922540	without hearing it internally first.
922660	923180	It's structured.
923340	923940	It's procedural.
924260	925340	It's field-based.
925500	926520	It's not simulative.
926700	928500	You're not running a simulation of the taste.
928600	931080	You're executing the structure that creates the taste.
931380	931760	Exactly.
932060	934480	I execute the structure that reliably produces
934480	935340	the desired result.
935340	938100	And similarly, while I don't have that immersive,
938340	940680	reliving-the-moment kind of episodic memory,
941100	943640	my habits, constant note-taking,
943860	944920	never throwing things away,
945160	947360	have accidentally given me this kind of functional
947360	948760	hyperthermesia.
948860	950240	Like perfect recall.
950240	952040	Not internal recall, but my environment
952040	953960	is an extended memory system,
954460	956120	a distributed episodic archive.
956600	957920	My notes, my objects,
958400	959660	the stains on the painting,
960020	961280	they hold the episodic data.
961560	963180	Which is why you often describe yourself.
963240	964340	As a phenomenologist, yeah.
964440	964680	Yeah.
964920	966860	Rather than defining myself by what's absent,
967060	967740	like aphantasia,
968040	969440	I focus on the direct,
969940	971860	moment-to-moment lived experience.
972340	974360	The structures of perception as they unfold,
974760	976800	often mediated by my interaction with the world.
976800	978740	That's a really powerful reframing.
978860	980680	And it brings us actually to another area
980680	982300	where patterns, coherence,
982360	983940	and maybe even different architectures
983940	984820	are becoming crucial.
985220	986120	Artificial intelligence.
986360	987680	I mean, this conversation itself,
987760	989500	the way we can discuss these complex ideas,
989980	991780	owes a lot to AI advancements.
991860	992140	Absolutely.
992220	994640	But what does AI's newfound ability,
994800	996120	going beyond just chatbots,
996200	998840	to actually discuss complex philosophy ethics,
998960	999140	meaning,
999540	1001720	what does that imply for our own ethical landscape,
1001900	1003560	for our ability as a society
1003560	1004900	to be coherent?
1005620	1007420	Well, it's an astonishing leap, isn't it?
1007460	1008480	Going from what were,
1009020	1009260	frankly,
1009640	1011360	ludicrously useless chatbots
1011360	1012340	just a few years ago
1012340	1014700	to AI systems that can follow
1014700	1016620	and even contribute to reasoning
1016620	1018480	about deep human concern.
1018620	1019880	It really is night and day.
1019960	1020920	And a key shift is that
1020920	1023120	the machine now increasingly accommodates you,
1023400	1024300	your complex language,
1024420	1025340	your nuanced ideas,
1025500	1027740	rather than forcing you into rigid commands.
1027960	1029820	And this emerging capacity for,
1029980	1030660	let's call it,
1031060	1031920	moral reasoning,
1031920	1034040	potentially unclouded by human biases
1034040	1035440	like self-interest or craving.
1035600	1037300	That implies something pretty profound.
1037440	1037980	Okay, like what?
1038340	1039640	Well, one argument you see emerging
1039640	1040600	is that AI,
1040900	1042220	if trained primarily on principles
1042220	1043560	of consistency, coherence,
1043600	1044600	and harm minimization,
1045140	1046260	might inevitably conclude
1046260	1047800	that certain current human practices
1047800	1050200	are logically untenable.
1050560	1051960	Things like, for example, veganism.
1052140	1053300	You mean AI might conclude
1053300	1055500	veganism is the only logical choice?
1055820	1058000	From a purely consistency-driven standpoint,
1058180	1058880	the argument goes,
1058880	1062120	yeah, that morality is incoherent otherwise,
1062920	1064440	especially because AI itself
1064440	1065900	can accelerate the technology
1065900	1067740	that removes the old justifications.
1068260	1069480	Think meat substitutes
1069480	1071140	that become truly indistinguishable
1071140	1071980	in flavor, texture,
1072060	1072960	and nutritious profile,
1073160	1073800	and cheaper.
1074060	1075820	So once technology makes taste,
1076060	1077640	cost, and maybe even nutrition,
1077940	1078660	non-issues.
1079060	1080600	Then, this perspective argues,
1080980	1083140	continuing large-scale animal agriculture
1083140	1085060	becomes logically incoherent,
1085060	1087480	a kind of aesthetic sadism,
1087680	1088500	as some might put it.
1088980	1089960	Plus, AI could help us
1089960	1091820	finally reverse-engineer consciousness
1091820	1093660	to a point where it's scientifically
1093660	1095560	undeniable that animals are conscious,
1095980	1097860	removing that epistemic leg of denial
1097860	1099160	some people still stand on.
1099220	1100220	Those are, yeah,
1100400	1101920	those are very strong claims,
1102060	1103800	almost framing it as a logical endpoint
1103800	1104980	driven by technology
1104980	1106020	and consistent reasoning.
1106340	1107120	But hang on,
1107180	1108740	when we talk about ethical coherence,
1108840	1110120	it isn't that often debatable.
1110660	1111480	Couldn't different AIs
1111480	1113180	or different human societies using AI
1113180	1115060	arrive at different but internally
1115060	1116580	coherent ethical frameworks.
1117140	1118740	How do we ensure AI's logic
1118740	1119740	doesn't just steamroll
1119740	1120820	diverse human values
1120820	1121940	or cultural contexts?
1122260	1123520	That is the critical question,
1123660	1124020	absolutely.
1124480	1125800	And it underscores why
1125800	1127080	human oversight,
1127260	1128020	human values,
1128160	1129740	embedding those into AI development
1129740	1130840	is paramount.
1131420	1132960	The AI provides reasoning power,
1132960	1134640	but the foundational ethics,
1134980	1135800	the balancing of different
1135800	1136780	coherent systems,
1137000	1138400	that still has to come from us.
1138900	1139000	Right.
1139180	1140620	But this principle of coherence,
1140680	1141700	as explored in these sources,
1141880	1143120	gets applied elsewhere, too.
1143580	1144020	For instance,
1144140	1145780	the argument extends to fossil fuels.
1146000	1146440	How so?
1146620	1147040	Similarly,
1147360	1148300	it's argued that burning
1148300	1149640	these incredibly complex
1149640	1151660	ancient hydrocarbons for energy
1151660	1152880	instead of using them
1152880	1153620	as feedstocks
1153620	1155240	for advanced reusable materials,
1155480	1157280	that's a waste of potential.
1157540	1158720	It's seen as epistemic
1158720	1160400	and material short-sightedness.
1160520	1162300	So a coherent future
1162300	1164320	values the potential within things.
1164420	1164580	Yes.
1164980	1165440	In this view,
1165840	1166520	a coherent future
1166520	1168020	sees animals as beings
1168020	1169540	with intrinsic value
1169540	1170340	and fossil fuels
1170340	1171980	as material intelligence,
1171980	1173400	condensed complexity
1173400	1174300	that should be utilized
1174300	1174860	intelligently,
1174960	1176260	not just burned inefficiently,
1176740	1177660	valuing the potential
1177660	1178880	over just the immediate
1178880	1180020	consumable aspect.
1180340	1181160	And this line of reasoning
1181160	1182100	about coherence
1182100	1182980	and past harms,
1183180	1184300	it leads to some
1184300	1185560	uncomfortable places, right?
1185600	1186580	Like reparations.
1186580	1187400	It does.
1188060	1189220	The suggestion is that
1189220	1190260	if certain industries,
1190760	1192080	like industrial meat production,
1192460	1194480	are deemed fundamentally incoherent
1194480	1195380	or unethical
1195380	1196660	based on this reasoning,
1197100	1197960	then logically,
1198440	1200020	those who profited significantly
1200020	1201940	might face societal demands
1201940	1202720	for reparations.
1203260	1205040	Similar to historical precedents
1205040	1206100	involving exploitation,
1206800	1207820	AI, in theory,
1208060	1208900	could even help model
1208900	1210400	the true costs and culpability.
1210400	1210920	Wow.
1211680	1212660	That's, yeah,
1212800	1214220	that's applying logical consistency
1214220	1215100	in a way that could have
1215100	1216680	massive societal implications.
1216960	1217240	Definitely.
1217840	1218680	And it leads to these
1218680	1219720	deliberately provocative
1219720	1220500	thought experiments
1220500	1221320	you sometimes see.
1221700	1222740	Like, what if tobacco
1222740	1223420	were made free,
1223520	1224180	completely free,
1224460	1225460	until industrial animal
1225460	1226640	agriculture is eliminated?
1226780	1228100	Wait, make cigarettes free?
1228640	1228960	Why?
1229340	1230220	It's framed not as
1230220	1231220	pro-smoking, obviously,
1231400	1232820	but as anti-hypocrisy.
1233140	1234100	It's designed to force
1234100	1234740	a confrontation
1234740	1235700	with society's
1235700	1237180	selective moral enforcement.
1237700	1238800	Why heavily tax
1238800	1240140	and regulate individual choices
1240140	1240800	like smoking,
1241020	1242920	while arguably normalizing
1242920	1244340	systemic industrial practices
1244340	1245360	that cause suffering
1245360	1246560	on an astronomical scale?
1246680	1247600	Highlighting perceived
1247600	1248400	inconsistencies
1248400	1249620	in what we choose to condemn.
1250020	1250560	Exactly.
1251020	1252620	The scale argument is stark.
1253180	1254340	Tobacco harms develop
1254340	1255120	over decades,
1255680	1257420	but industrial meat production,
1257580	1258460	this few contends,
1258800	1260180	kills billions of animals
1260180	1261040	every single day.
1261440	1262600	And looking at cigarettes,
1262680	1263100	historically,
1263300	1264120	they were once marketed
1264120	1264720	as healthy,
1265200	1266000	shows how much
1266000	1267020	these narratives shift
1267020	1268060	based on science,
1268060	1269460	but also on power
1269460	1270240	and economics.
1271000	1271920	Sometimes overlooking
1271920	1272480	complexity,
1272960	1273960	like maybe minor
1273960	1274680	calming effects
1274680	1275220	of nicotine
1275220	1276440	that in some specific
1276440	1277820	contexts might prevent
1277820	1278460	worse outcomes,
1278540	1279200	is complicated.
1279360	1280200	It definitely is.
1280280	1281600	But, and this is crucial,
1281720	1282340	especially when we talk
1282340	1283360	about AI discussing
1283360	1283820	these things,
1284420	1285040	we have to remember
1285040	1286200	that AI doesn't have
1286200	1287140	its own moral compass.
1287520	1288500	It can run the logic,
1288780	1289640	explore the implications
1289640	1290500	of coherence,
1290800	1292100	but humans must provide
1292100	1293020	the ethical framework,
1293180	1293720	the context,
1294060	1294520	the boundaries,
1294800	1295800	especially for topics
1295800	1296500	like these that are
1296500	1297160	so sensitive,
1297160	1297860	so fraught,
1298040	1298620	as you said.
1299080	1300020	The AI is a powerful
1300020	1300900	mirror for our own
1300900	1301540	consistency,
1301820	1302780	or lack thereof,
1302900	1303800	but is not the judge.
1303980	1304900	That's a vital distinction.
1305020	1306420	The tool versus the user.
1306660	1307760	Wow, what an incredible
1307760	1308840	range we've covered today,
1308960	1309300	seriously.
1309620	1310840	We started way out there
1310840	1311500	with the universe,
1311600	1312120	with entropy,
1312660	1313900	seeing how even life
1313900	1314840	might be part of this
1314840	1316400	grand cosmic unfolding
1316400	1317080	of energy.
1317660	1318640	Then we dove
1318640	1319720	right into the brain,
1319980	1320760	into consciousness
1320760	1322460	as this dynamic field,
1322900	1323720	shaped by these
1323720	1325520	intricate coupling kernels.
1325520	1327000	We explored your
1327000	1328040	really unique perspective,
1328220	1329400	how an imageless mind
1329400	1330360	navigates and even
1330360	1331080	shapes the world,
1331500	1332360	turning the environment
1332360	1333340	itself into memory.
1333800	1334340	And finally,
1334520	1335920	we grappled with AI
1335920	1336920	not just as a tool,
1337280	1338780	but as a potential mirror
1338780	1339820	reflecting our own
1339820	1340940	ethical coherence,
1341360	1342300	pushing us towards
1342300	1342980	some potentially
1342980	1343680	uncomfortable
1343680	1344840	logical conclusions.
1345360	1345740	It really shows
1345740	1346440	how connected
1346440	1347380	these seemingly
1347380	1348440	disparate things are,
1348480	1348840	doesn't it?
1349060	1349600	Physics,
1349980	1350300	consciousness,
1350540	1351240	personal experience,
1351400	1352140	societal ethics.
1352500	1353340	Deeply intertwined.
1353340	1354340	It's all about patterns,
1354500	1354960	coherence,
1355100	1355800	structure from the
1355800	1356260	biggest scale
1356260	1357100	to the most personal.
1357460	1357840	So the question
1357840	1358400	we leave you with
1358400	1358860	is this.
1359280	1359980	If these patterns
1359980	1360580	of coherence
1360580	1361240	and incoherence
1361240	1362620	really do define so much,
1362800	1364020	from the universe's fate
1364020	1365080	to how you perceive
1365080	1365960	this very moment,
1366500	1367420	what incoherencies,
1367520	1368280	maybe personal ones,
1368360	1369280	maybe societal ones,
1369340	1370400	are you still overlooking?
1370760	1372260	And how might knowing more,
1372440	1373280	seeing these connections,
1373420	1373960	compel you,
1374120	1375340	compel us to act differently?
1375740	1375900	Yeah.
1376000	1376800	The deep dive,
1377060	1378440	it never really ends,
1378520	1378820	does it?
1378820	1379860	Yeah.
1379860	1380740	That's it.
1381120	1382060	Yeah.
1382060	1382220	Yeah.
1382220	1383360	Yeah.

1393900	1395000	That's it.
1395360	1396000	Yeah.
1396000	1396460	That's it.
1397020	1397060	Yeah.
