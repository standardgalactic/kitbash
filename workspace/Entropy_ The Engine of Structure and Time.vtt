00:00.000 --> 00:01.520
Okay, let's really unpack this today.

00:01.640 --> 00:11.660
What if the biggest laws governing the whole universe, the deepest stuff going on in your own mind, and even where society's heading ethically?

00:12.480 --> 00:16.580
What if it's all tied together by like a single really powerful thread?

00:17.040 --> 00:21.300
Today we're taking a deep dive into this pretty extraordinary stack of sources.

00:21.700 --> 00:27.920
Stuff that will challenge how you think about patterns, coherence, you know, the forces shaping basically everything.

00:28.100 --> 00:28.980
Yeah, it's quite a mix.

00:28.980 --> 00:39.740
Right. So our mission is to pull out the most surprising bits, connect these dots between fields that seem totally unrelated, and hopefully help you see things, well, maybe with a fresh perspective.

00:40.020 --> 00:42.060
And here's where it gets really interesting.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.800
So maybe we should start with something people often think of as just decay.

00:46.080 --> 00:46.320
Right.

00:46.460 --> 00:46.780
Entropy.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.520
And things falling apart.

00:47.700 --> 00:48.080
Exactly.

00:48.260 --> 00:48.440
Yeah.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.320
But it's actually way more profound than that.

00:50.580 --> 00:56.300
At its core, entropy is really just about how spread out energy is, how dispersed it becomes.

00:56.400 --> 00:56.620
Okay.

00:56.620 --> 00:59.620
You probably know it from like old steam engines, car knows work.

01:00.260 --> 01:04.580
Even a perfect engine inevitably wastes some energy as heat.

01:04.700 --> 01:05.720
It just spreads out.

01:05.880 --> 01:06.080
Yeah.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.800
You can't get 100% efficiency.

01:08.160 --> 01:08.640
Precisely.

01:09.060 --> 01:12.840
Or, you know, why shattered glass doesn't just decide to reassemble itself.

01:13.100 --> 01:15.340
The energy state is more spread out when it's broken.

01:15.780 --> 01:17.080
That's the universe's tendency.

01:17.080 --> 01:17.520
Okay.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.560
So things naturally want to spread out, become less concentrated.

01:20.820 --> 01:26.940
But then how do you get complex things like us or stars, galaxies?

01:27.040 --> 01:29.220
They seem super organized, low entropy.

01:29.620 --> 01:30.060
Yeah.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.080
That's the key, isn't it?

01:31.300 --> 01:32.900
The Earth, see, it's an open system.

01:33.120 --> 01:33.620
That's crucial.

01:33.940 --> 01:35.580
Meaning energy comes in and goes out.

01:35.580 --> 01:35.920
Exactly.

01:36.040 --> 01:40.000
We get this concentrated, low entropy energy pouring in from the sun constantly.

01:40.460 --> 01:44.840
And then the Earth radiates energy back out into space, but it's dispersed.

01:45.060 --> 01:46.000
High entropy energy.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.060
Heat, basically.

01:47.180 --> 01:47.380
Okay.

01:47.460 --> 01:48.140
So there's a flow.

01:48.520 --> 01:48.800
Right.

01:49.060 --> 01:51.280
And here's a really revolutionary idea from Jeremy England.

01:51.780 --> 01:55.500
He proposes that life, well, life doesn't defy entropy.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.360
It exists because it's incredibly good at increasing it.

01:58.420 --> 02:00.080
Wait, life increases entropy.

02:00.320 --> 02:00.660
How did...

02:00.660 --> 02:04.700
Life being really efficient at taking that concentrated solar energy and dissipating it,

02:04.860 --> 02:08.820
spreading it out faster and more effectively than, say, just a rock would.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.760
He even has this great quote, something like,

02:11.680 --> 02:16.500
if you shine light on a random clump of atoms long enough, it shouldn't be surprising if you get a plant.

02:16.860 --> 02:17.240
Wow.

02:17.420 --> 02:17.600
Okay.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.360
So life isn't fighting the tide.

02:19.500 --> 02:23.360
It's riding the wave, even making the wave bigger.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.480
You could put it that way.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.640
Yeah, it's like life is an engine for entropy.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.040
Yeah.

02:27.120 --> 02:32.080
Finding clever ways to accelerate that energy dispersal, it's a total flip in perspective.

02:32.340 --> 02:33.080
It really is.

02:33.100 --> 02:36.200
And this whole cosmic dance, it's not just about biology.

02:36.440 --> 02:36.640
Yeah.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.280
Think way back to the early universe.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.200
It started out incredibly uniform, right?

02:40.380 --> 02:40.720
Smooth.

02:40.980 --> 02:43.580
Yeah, almost boringly smooth, cosmologically speaking.

02:43.700 --> 02:43.920
Right.

02:44.300 --> 02:52.060
But that uniformity, counterintuitively, was a very low entropy state because gravity, gravity hates uniformity.

02:52.060 --> 02:53.480
It wants to pull things together.

02:53.480 --> 02:56.120
It's inherently unstable in a smooth universe.

02:56.440 --> 02:56.980
Ah, okay.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.880
So the potential for clumping was there.

02:59.120 --> 02:59.440
Exactly.

02:59.960 --> 03:03.000
That low entropy smoothness inevitably led to clumping.

03:03.460 --> 03:06.080
Gravity pulls stuff together, forming stars, galaxies.

03:06.460 --> 03:06.700
Yeah.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.040
Even black holes, which are sometimes called entropy monsters.

03:10.220 --> 03:10.940
Entropy monsters.

03:11.120 --> 03:11.340
Why?

03:11.340 --> 03:17.300
Because they are incredibly efficient at, well, basically maximizing entropy within their event horizon.

03:17.380 --> 03:23.280
But the point is, all this structure emerges because of that initial low entropy state and gravity's pull.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.240
We live in this amazing middle ground.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.240
This temporary pocket of complexity.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.120
Yeah, these beautiful, complex, but ultimately temporary structures like us.

03:32.200 --> 03:32.360
Yeah.

03:32.520 --> 03:40.080
We emerge not despite entropy, but kind of as its engine, as part of the universe's grand project of spreading energy out.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.600
That is mind-bending.

03:41.600 --> 03:52.660
So if this drive towards patterns, towards spreading energy is so fundamental, how does that translate down to something as intricate, as personal, as our own minds, our consciousness?

03:52.900 --> 03:56.600
Well, this whole idea of pattern and coherence, it maps quite directly onto consciousness.

03:56.880 --> 04:00.880
There's fascinating research, for instance, from the Qualia Research Institute, QRI.

04:01.040 --> 04:01.660
QRI, right.

04:01.660 --> 04:08.820
They propose that consciousness isn't just, you know, neuron A firing the neuron B. It's more like it emerges as a global field topology.

04:08.980 --> 04:11.780
A global field topology, like a shape.

04:12.060 --> 04:21.060
Kind of, yeah. Think of it like a unified pattern across the whole brain that is your conscious experience, your sense of self, what it feels like to be you.

04:21.180 --> 04:21.460
Okay.

04:21.660 --> 04:26.120
It's like the music emerging from the whole orchestra, not just the sound of one violin.

04:26.120 --> 04:38.340
And what distinguishes your specific conscious bubble, your you-ness, from everything else might be actual physical electromagnetic looping structures, vortices, maybe, in this field.

04:38.580 --> 04:42.320
Whoa. Actual physical boundaries made of fields.

04:42.660 --> 04:43.540
That's the hypothesis.

04:43.920 --> 04:48.800
Not arbitrary lines, but real topological features, like the edge of a whirlpool.

04:48.980 --> 04:53.540
Okay. So it's less about the individual brain cells and more about the overall pattern they create together.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.300
How does the brain do that?

04:55.300 --> 04:56.540
How does it shape this field?

04:56.780 --> 04:59.700
Right. That's where something they call the coupling kernel comes into play.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.740
Coupling kernel. Okay.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.320
Imagine like a set of invisible control knobs for the whole system.

05:05.100 --> 05:09.660
Think of your brain having all these oscillating units, like millions of tiny metronomes.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.340
Yeah, ticking away.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.780
Right. And they're all on this kind of vibrating table, influencing each other.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.940
The coupling kernel is basically the mathematical rule book.

05:17.140 --> 05:21.540
It says how strongly and in what way each metronome affects the others.

05:21.540 --> 05:26.300
Maybe based on how close they are or if they're in sync or out of sync, you know.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.980
So it dictates the connections, the influence network?

05:29.320 --> 05:35.080
Exactly. It's the set of levers that sculpt the field's overall shape and dynamics.

05:35.080 --> 05:40.120
So by adjusting these levers, the brain can change the whole conscious experience.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.480
Precisely. For instance, think about network structures.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.840
A small world network that's one that has lots of local connections, like neighbors talking to neighbors,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.220
but also a few random long-range connections, like little wormholes across the brain.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.660
Right. I've heard of that structure. Efficient communication.

05:55.980 --> 06:00.220
Yeah. And it turns out that kind of structure, governed by the right coupling kernel,

06:00.440 --> 06:03.520
can dramatically change the global coherence.

06:03.700 --> 06:09.600
It can allow for these really profound integrated experiences where everything feels connected.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.200
And even local things matter.

06:11.560 --> 06:11.700
Yeah.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.420
Like there's this process called divisive normalization,

06:14.680 --> 06:20.160
where a neuron basically adjusts its own output based on what its neighbors are doing.

06:20.260 --> 06:21.720
It takes context into account.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.140
Like turning down the volume if everyone else is shouting.

06:24.820 --> 06:25.240
Sort of, yeah.

06:25.480 --> 06:25.680
Yeah.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.600
And these local processes create these traveling waves of activity.

06:30.040 --> 06:35.860
And these waves then get sort of locked into or entrained by the larger global field modes

06:35.860 --> 06:37.380
via these coupling kernels.

06:37.640 --> 06:41.500
Wow. So local activity feeds into the global pattern through these rules.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.680
Exactly. And what's really mind-blowing, I think,

06:44.040 --> 06:47.960
is that QRI started by looking at phenomenology subjective experience, right?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.000
What does consciousness feel like?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.280
Yeah. A first-person approach.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.320
But their models are now converging with mainstream neuroscience,

06:54.820 --> 06:56.740
which is totally data-driven, third-person.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.500
Researchers like Marco Achiel, Solon Adesoy, Morton Kringleback.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.840
They're using heavy math, stuff like spectral graph theory, connectome harmonics.

07:06.180 --> 07:08.700
Looking at the brain's wiring diagram and vibrations.

07:08.700 --> 07:12.420
Right. And they're ending up with mathematically really similar models.

07:12.580 --> 07:16.700
It strongly suggests that, yeah, these brain-wide patterns, these oscillations,

07:16.800 --> 07:19.940
are organized around these fundamental mathematical kernels.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.920
It doesn't matter if you start from the inside looking out or the outside looking in.

07:23.920 --> 07:29.100
That's huge. It's like finding the same answer using two completely different methods.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.020
It really validates the core idea.

07:31.020 --> 07:32.020
It really does.

07:32.420 --> 07:36.480
So, okay. If the brain can sculpt these fields using coupling kernels,

07:36.700 --> 07:40.760
what does this mean for how we actually experience the world?

07:40.840 --> 07:43.840
Especially, say, in altered states. You mentioned psychedelics earlier.

07:43.840 --> 07:49.200
Yeah. This framework offers a potentially powerful mechanistic way to think about

07:49.200 --> 07:52.640
why different psychedelics have such wildly different effects.

07:52.820 --> 07:53.540
Okay. How so?

07:53.660 --> 07:58.500
Well, the hypothesis is that different drugs, like, say, DMT versus 5-Mayo-DMT,

07:58.720 --> 08:01.080
actually change the brain's coupling kernel.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.320
They tweak those control knobs differently.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.720
Ah. So they change the rules of the dance.

08:06.120 --> 08:06.900
Exactly. Yeah.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.100
So, for example, DMT.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.880
Maybe it induces a kernel where the couplings alternate,

08:11.880 --> 08:14.380
positive, then negative, positive, then negative.

08:14.380 --> 08:18.180
This would lead to the field breaking up into lots of separate complex clusters.

08:18.580 --> 08:18.900
Fragmented.

08:19.160 --> 08:23.700
Right. Which might correlate with those really vivid, highly detailed,

08:24.140 --> 08:26.140
differentiated experiences people report.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.740
Even encountering perceived entities,

08:29.120 --> 08:31.440
maybe those are distinct clusters in the field topology.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.260
Fascinating. And 5-Mayo-DMT.

08:34.540 --> 08:37.720
In contrast, 5-Mayo-DMT, maybe it creates a kernel

08:37.720 --> 08:41.820
where all the couplings become strongly positive, uniformly positive.

08:41.940 --> 08:42.860
Pushing everything together.

08:43.020 --> 08:46.260
Yeah. Driving the whole system towards maximum global coherence.

08:46.540 --> 08:48.240
One single unified state,

08:48.700 --> 08:51.340
which aligns really well with reports of ego dissolution,

08:51.960 --> 08:54.060
oceanic boundlessness, pure unity.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.360
Wow. Different settings on the knobs,

08:56.520 --> 08:58.280
completely different conscious worlds.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.020
That makes a strange kind of sense.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.380
And does this link to how we construct our normal, everyday reality, too?

09:04.620 --> 09:07.100
Absolutely. This extends into how we build our stable,

09:07.220 --> 09:09.700
day-to-day reality through something called projective intelligence.

09:09.820 --> 09:10.780
Projective intelligence. Okay.

09:10.780 --> 09:15.700
The idea here is that our normal, coherent, conscious intelligence

09:15.700 --> 09:19.500
arises when different sensory fields,

09:19.660 --> 09:22.260
which have different inherent dimensionalities,

09:22.640 --> 09:23.860
successfully synchronize.

09:24.000 --> 09:24.720
Different dimensions.

09:25.180 --> 09:27.820
But your visual field is fundamentally 2D, right?

09:27.860 --> 09:28.480
Like a screen.

09:28.680 --> 09:28.900
Yeah.

09:29.140 --> 09:32.520
But your somatic sense, your body sense, feels 3D.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.440
Okay. Yeah.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.620
So projective intelligence suggests that when these fields,

09:37.240 --> 09:41.620
the 2D visual, the 3D somatic, maybe others interlock perfectly,

09:41.860 --> 09:43.540
maybe through specific projection kernels.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.260
More kernels.

09:44.380 --> 09:44.840
Ah, yeah.

09:44.980 --> 09:46.080
Kernels all the way down, maybe.

09:46.340 --> 09:46.560
Yeah.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.880
But when they lock perfectly, any prediction errors just collapse.

09:50.000 --> 09:50.140
Yeah.

09:50.360 --> 09:50.940
Everything aligns.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.420
And that, the theory goes,

09:52.500 --> 09:55.680
can lead to these profound, high-valence states of unity,

09:55.680 --> 09:56.720
where there's, quote,

09:56.720 --> 09:59.860
just no information content because there's no mismatch,

09:59.940 --> 10:00.680
no error signal.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.060
Everything just is.

10:02.180 --> 10:05.060
A state of perfect coherence between sensory inputs.

10:05.180 --> 10:05.500
Exactly.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.020
And conversely, if that coupling breaks,

10:08.580 --> 10:10.540
maybe like in some forms of autism, potentially,

10:10.960 --> 10:11.140
Yeah.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.920
you could see breakdowns in things that rely on that integration,

10:14.060 --> 10:16.300
like object permanence or spatial coherence.

10:16.320 --> 10:16.900
That makes sense.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.760
If the fields aren't locking together properly.

10:19.180 --> 10:19.420
Right.

10:19.420 --> 10:21.100
And some people are even pushing this further,

10:21.540 --> 10:23.920
suggesting we could understand conscious experience itself

10:23.920 --> 10:25.740
through a path integral perspective.

10:25.940 --> 10:26.520
Whoa, okay.

10:26.840 --> 10:27.560
Path integral.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.420
That sounds like physics, like Feynman diagrams.

10:30.620 --> 10:31.420
Kind of analogous, yeah.

10:31.760 --> 10:36.960
The idea, very roughly, is that what it's like to be you right now

10:36.960 --> 10:39.060
isn't just one single brain state.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.120
It's like a superposition, a blend,

10:41.120 --> 10:44.880
of all the possible paths the electrical activity could be taking

10:44.880 --> 10:46.640
within the boundary, the pocket,

10:46.640 --> 10:49.860
created by your brain's overall oscillatory dynamics.

10:50.180 --> 10:54.320
So my current feeling of me is like an average of all nearby possible mess.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.920
In a very loose metaphorical sense, maybe,

10:57.500 --> 11:01.040
it suggests that consciousness is this continuous integration of possibilities

11:01.040 --> 11:02.220
within a defined structure.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.800
And this leads to interesting ideas about states like, say,

11:04.880 --> 11:08.380
classic Buddhist awakening or that 5-Me-O-DMT state we talked about.

11:08.460 --> 11:08.840
Tell so.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.620
Maybe those states are related to a simplification of that topological pocket,

11:12.840 --> 11:16.200
like the boundaries dissolve or the number of possible paths collapses,

11:16.640 --> 11:19.980
leading to a superposition of all possible points of view at once.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.080
No fixed self, just pure unified awareness.

11:23.420 --> 11:26.640
A state of, like, maximum possible coherence

11:26.640 --> 11:31.140
because the boundaries defining self versus other have dissolved.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.240
Something like that, yeah.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.220
It's a radical way to think about it,

11:34.280 --> 11:36.600
connecting field dynamics to these profound states.

11:36.800 --> 11:37.800
It absolutely is.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.260
And, you know, speaking of unique perspectives,

11:41.020 --> 11:43.000
you shared some really fascinating things before

11:43.000 --> 11:45.980
about your own cognitive landscape, how your mind works,

11:45.980 --> 11:48.200
which really challenges some common assumptions.

11:48.640 --> 11:53.220
Could you tell us a bit about navigating the world with an imageless mind?

11:53.880 --> 11:54.240
Yeah, sure.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.940
So my own experience, I have aphantasia,

11:57.200 --> 11:59.600
which means I don't generate voluntary mental imagery.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.100
Also, asynesthesia, kind of the opposite of synesthesia,

12:03.380 --> 12:07.140
and an endophagia, which means no internal monologue or inner speech.

12:07.140 --> 12:09.040
So no mind's eye, no inner voice?

12:09.180 --> 12:09.620
Pretty much.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.580
It's like a systemic absence of sensory broadcast, you could say,

12:12.980 --> 12:13.880
in memory and thought.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.840
So when I recall something or think about something,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.300
it's rooted in, like, propositional logic, the facts, the relationships,

12:20.580 --> 12:23.440
or in physical reference, actual objects or actions,

12:23.820 --> 12:26.520
not in recreating a sensory experience internally.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.600
That's hard for many people, including me,

12:28.640 --> 12:30.920
to even imagine not having images.

12:31.320 --> 12:31.660
I know.

12:31.820 --> 12:33.740
But it's crucial to see it not as a deficit,

12:33.740 --> 12:36.180
just a different cognate architecture.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.340
And it turns out it's maybe not as uncommon as people think,

12:39.400 --> 12:40.260
especially historically.

12:40.580 --> 12:43.480
I found this amazing resonance in Francis Galton's work

12:43.480 --> 12:44.900
from way back in 1890.

12:45.220 --> 12:45.700
Galton.

12:45.940 --> 12:46.740
What did he find?

12:46.960 --> 12:47.700
He did this survey,

12:47.860 --> 12:50.160
and it kind of quietly debunked the whole idea

12:50.160 --> 12:52.940
that high intelligence requires mental imagery.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.380
He found loads of very accomplished scientists and thinkers

12:56.380 --> 12:59.420
who reported having little to no internal imagery at all.

12:59.480 --> 12:59.760
Really?

12:59.920 --> 13:00.660
Back in 1890?

13:01.060 --> 13:01.240
Yeah.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.160
And even earlier, L. Woolicott in 1920 described

13:04.160 --> 13:06.520
wordless, imageless thought,

13:07.120 --> 13:09.820
these sort of ethical intuitions guiding action

13:09.820 --> 13:12.820
from deeper mental layers without conscious words or pictures,

13:13.340 --> 13:17.620
a kind of proto-RSVP philosophy of mind, remarkably prescient.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.600
So your mind operates more on structure, logic,

13:20.840 --> 13:21.980
maybe action schemas,

13:22.040 --> 13:24.480
rather than simulations like mental pictures or sounds.

13:24.820 --> 13:26.000
How does that actually play out

13:26.000 --> 13:27.780
in how you interact with your environment day to day?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.560
Oh, it shapes it massively.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.320
You know Barbara Traversky's great work, Mind in Motion.

13:32.780 --> 13:34.880
She argues action shapes thought.

13:35.380 --> 13:37.280
For me, that's profoundly true,

13:37.380 --> 13:39.660
but it's not mental imagery derived from action

13:39.660 --> 13:40.940
that grounds my spatial thinking.

13:41.260 --> 13:44.860
It's the dynamic structure of my actual sensorimotor fields,

13:45.040 --> 13:47.340
often externalized onto the environment itself.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.040
Externalized?

13:48.160 --> 13:48.540
How do you mean?

13:48.540 --> 13:51.060
Well, instead of just mentally noting keys are by the door,

13:51.320 --> 13:53.560
I tend to arrange my whole living space

13:53.560 --> 13:56.260
almost like a semantic architecture.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.360
I'm constantly, unconsciously maybe,

13:58.840 --> 14:00.120
instantiating a world

14:00.120 --> 14:02.680
where certain actions, certain identities

14:02.680 --> 14:04.840
are primed just by the physical layout.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.000
You're encoding meaning into the physical space.

14:07.080 --> 14:07.500
Exactly.

14:07.660 --> 14:09.620
Like my Van Gogh print over the stove.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.100
It started as acrylic on cement canvas board.

14:12.220 --> 14:12.400
Yeah.

14:12.520 --> 14:13.080
Pretty standard.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.200
But now, it records all of my meals.

14:16.420 --> 14:16.840
Records them.

14:17.040 --> 14:17.220
Yeah.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.760
It absorbs the steam, the grease splatters, the smoke.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.260
It's become this evolving temporal surface.

14:22.380 --> 14:25.060
A kind of smoke-stained entropy diary, actually.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.640
It's almost like a post-representational artwork for me.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.140
And it's honestly the closest thing I have

14:30.140 --> 14:33.000
to a slow-cooked mnemonic fossil of past meals.

14:33.360 --> 14:33.880
Wow.

14:34.720 --> 14:35.300
That's incredible.

14:35.420 --> 14:37.380
It's like the painting is the memory trace.

14:37.380 --> 14:38.020
In a way, yeah.

14:38.540 --> 14:43.040
My desire to sometimes freeze samples of each unique meal,

14:43.440 --> 14:45.720
that comes from what I call the scalar tragedy

14:45.720 --> 14:46.920
of memory without imagery.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.680
You live these rich sensory experiences once,

14:49.800 --> 14:51.840
and then, poof, they're gone.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.300
There's no internal replay button.

14:53.780 --> 14:56.280
So the physical trace becomes incredibly important.

14:56.380 --> 14:57.280
That makes so much sense.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.660
Your environment becomes an external hard drive

14:59.660 --> 15:00.540
for experiences.

15:00.680 --> 15:00.920
Totally.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.800
It even extends to things like cooking.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.900
I can cook complex meals without a recipe,

15:05.900 --> 15:07.260
without tasting as I go.

15:08.060 --> 15:10.400
It's all based on understanding the chemical principles,

15:10.560 --> 15:11.440
the scaling ratios,

15:11.960 --> 15:14.020
balancing flavors methodically, structurally.

15:14.620 --> 15:16.160
It's a perfect analogy, I think,

15:16.620 --> 15:19.240
for how I experience thinking without imagery

15:19.240 --> 15:20.760
or, say, playing music,

15:20.900 --> 15:22.540
without hearing it internally first.

15:22.660 --> 15:23.180
It's structured.

15:23.340 --> 15:23.940
It's procedural.

15:24.260 --> 15:25.340
It's field-based.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.520
It's not simulative.

15:26.700 --> 15:28.500
You're not running a simulation of the taste.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.080
You're executing the structure that creates the taste.

15:31.380 --> 15:31.760
Exactly.

15:32.060 --> 15:34.480
I execute the structure that reliably produces

15:34.480 --> 15:35.340
the desired result.

15:35.340 --> 15:38.100
And similarly, while I don't have that immersive,

15:38.340 --> 15:40.680
reliving-the-moment kind of episodic memory,

15:41.100 --> 15:43.640
my habits, constant note-taking,

15:43.860 --> 15:44.920
never throwing things away,

15:45.160 --> 15:47.360
have accidentally given me this kind of functional

15:47.360 --> 15:48.760
hyperthermesia.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.240
Like perfect recall.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.040
Not internal recall, but my environment

15:52.040 --> 15:53.960
is an extended memory system,

15:54.460 --> 15:56.120
a distributed episodic archive.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.920
My notes, my objects,

15:58.400 --> 15:59.660
the stains on the painting,

16:00.020 --> 16:01.280
they hold the episodic data.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.180
Which is why you often describe yourself.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.340
As a phenomenologist, yeah.

16:04.440 --> 16:04.680
Yeah.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.860
Rather than defining myself by what's absent,

16:07.060 --> 16:07.740
like aphantasia,

16:08.040 --> 16:09.440
I focus on the direct,

16:09.940 --> 16:11.860
moment-to-moment lived experience.

16:12.340 --> 16:14.360
The structures of perception as they unfold,

16:14.760 --> 16:16.800
often mediated by my interaction with the world.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.740
That's a really powerful reframing.

16:18.860 --> 16:20.680
And it brings us actually to another area

16:20.680 --> 16:22.300
where patterns, coherence,

16:22.360 --> 16:23.940
and maybe even different architectures

16:23.940 --> 16:24.820
are becoming crucial.

16:25.220 --> 16:26.120
Artificial intelligence.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.680
I mean, this conversation itself,

16:27.760 --> 16:29.500
the way we can discuss these complex ideas,

16:29.980 --> 16:31.780
owes a lot to AI advancements.

16:31.860 --> 16:32.140
Absolutely.

16:32.220 --> 16:34.640
But what does AI's newfound ability,

16:34.800 --> 16:36.120
going beyond just chatbots,

16:36.200 --> 16:38.840
to actually discuss complex philosophy ethics,

16:38.960 --> 16:39.140
meaning,

16:39.540 --> 16:41.720
what does that imply for our own ethical landscape,

16:41.900 --> 16:43.560
for our ability as a society

16:43.560 --> 16:44.900
to be coherent?

16:45.620 --> 16:47.420
Well, it's an astonishing leap, isn't it?

16:47.460 --> 16:48.480
Going from what were,

16:49.020 --> 16:49.260
frankly,

16:49.640 --> 16:51.360
ludicrously useless chatbots

16:51.360 --> 16:52.340
just a few years ago

16:52.340 --> 16:54.700
to AI systems that can follow

16:54.700 --> 16:56.620
and even contribute to reasoning

16:56.620 --> 16:58.480
about deep human concern.

16:58.620 --> 16:59.880
It really is night and day.

16:59.960 --> 17:00.920
And a key shift is that

17:00.920 --> 17:03.120
the machine now increasingly accommodates you,

17:03.400 --> 17:04.300
your complex language,

17:04.420 --> 17:05.340
your nuanced ideas,

17:05.500 --> 17:07.740
rather than forcing you into rigid commands.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.820
And this emerging capacity for,

17:09.980 --> 17:10.660
let's call it,

17:11.060 --> 17:11.920
moral reasoning,

17:11.920 --> 17:14.040
potentially unclouded by human biases

17:14.040 --> 17:15.440
like self-interest or craving.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.300
That implies something pretty profound.

17:17.440 --> 17:17.980
Okay, like what?

17:18.340 --> 17:19.640
Well, one argument you see emerging

17:19.640 --> 17:20.600
is that AI,

17:20.900 --> 17:22.220
if trained primarily on principles

17:22.220 --> 17:23.560
of consistency, coherence,

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
and harm minimization,

17:25.140 --> 17:26.260
might inevitably conclude

17:26.260 --> 17:27.800
that certain current human practices

17:27.800 --> 17:30.200
are logically untenable.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.960
Things like, for example, veganism.

17:32.140 --> 17:33.300
You mean AI might conclude

17:33.300 --> 17:35.500
veganism is the only logical choice?

17:35.820 --> 17:38.000
From a purely consistency-driven standpoint,

17:38.180 --> 17:38.880
the argument goes,

17:38.880 --> 17:42.120
yeah, that morality is incoherent otherwise,

17:42.920 --> 17:44.440
especially because AI itself

17:44.440 --> 17:45.900
can accelerate the technology

17:45.900 --> 17:47.740
that removes the old justifications.

17:48.260 --> 17:49.480
Think meat substitutes

17:49.480 --> 17:51.140
that become truly indistinguishable

17:51.140 --> 17:51.980
in flavor, texture,

17:52.060 --> 17:52.960
and nutritious profile,

17:53.160 --> 17:53.800
and cheaper.

17:54.060 --> 17:55.820
So once technology makes taste,

17:56.060 --> 17:57.640
cost, and maybe even nutrition,

17:57.940 --> 17:58.660
non-issues.

17:59.060 --> 18:00.600
Then, this perspective argues,

18:00.980 --> 18:03.140
continuing large-scale animal agriculture

18:03.140 --> 18:05.060
becomes logically incoherent,

18:05.060 --> 18:07.480
a kind of aesthetic sadism,

18:07.680 --> 18:08.500
as some might put it.

18:08.980 --> 18:09.960
Plus, AI could help us

18:09.960 --> 18:11.820
finally reverse-engineer consciousness

18:11.820 --> 18:13.660
to a point where it's scientifically

18:13.660 --> 18:15.560
undeniable that animals are conscious,

18:15.980 --> 18:17.860
removing that epistemic leg of denial

18:17.860 --> 18:19.160
some people still stand on.

18:19.220 --> 18:20.220
Those are, yeah,

18:20.400 --> 18:21.920
those are very strong claims,

18:22.060 --> 18:23.800
almost framing it as a logical endpoint

18:23.800 --> 18:24.980
driven by technology

18:24.980 --> 18:26.020
and consistent reasoning.

18:26.340 --> 18:27.120
But hang on,

18:27.180 --> 18:28.740
when we talk about ethical coherence,

18:28.840 --> 18:30.120
it isn't that often debatable.

18:30.660 --> 18:31.480
Couldn't different AIs

18:31.480 --> 18:33.180
or different human societies using AI

18:33.180 --> 18:35.060
arrive at different but internally

18:35.060 --> 18:36.580
coherent ethical frameworks.

18:37.140 --> 18:38.740
How do we ensure AI's logic

18:38.740 --> 18:39.740
doesn't just steamroll

18:39.740 --> 18:40.820
diverse human values

18:40.820 --> 18:41.940
or cultural contexts?

18:42.260 --> 18:43.520
That is the critical question,

18:43.660 --> 18:44.020
absolutely.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.800
And it underscores why

18:45.800 --> 18:47.080
human oversight,

18:47.260 --> 18:48.020
human values,

18:48.160 --> 18:49.740
embedding those into AI development

18:49.740 --> 18:50.840
is paramount.

18:51.420 --> 18:52.960
The AI provides reasoning power,

18:52.960 --> 18:54.640
but the foundational ethics,

18:54.980 --> 18:55.800
the balancing of different

18:55.800 --> 18:56.780
coherent systems,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.400
that still has to come from us.

18:58.900 --> 18:59.000
Right.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.620
But this principle of coherence,

19:00.680 --> 19:01.700
as explored in these sources,

19:01.880 --> 19:03.120
gets applied elsewhere, too.

19:03.580 --> 19:04.020
For instance,

19:04.140 --> 19:05.780
the argument extends to fossil fuels.

19:06.000 --> 19:06.440
How so?

19:06.620 --> 19:07.040
Similarly,

19:07.360 --> 19:08.300
it's argued that burning

19:08.300 --> 19:09.640
these incredibly complex

19:09.640 --> 19:11.660
ancient hydrocarbons for energy

19:11.660 --> 19:12.880
instead of using them

19:12.880 --> 19:13.620
as feedstocks

19:13.620 --> 19:15.240
for advanced reusable materials,

19:15.480 --> 19:17.280
that's a waste of potential.

19:17.540 --> 19:18.720
It's seen as epistemic

19:18.720 --> 19:20.400
and material short-sightedness.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.300
So a coherent future

19:22.300 --> 19:24.320
values the potential within things.

19:24.420 --> 19:24.580
Yes.

19:24.980 --> 19:25.440
In this view,

19:25.840 --> 19:26.520
a coherent future

19:26.520 --> 19:28.020
sees animals as beings

19:28.020 --> 19:29.540
with intrinsic value

19:29.540 --> 19:30.340
and fossil fuels

19:30.340 --> 19:31.980
as material intelligence,

19:31.980 --> 19:33.400
condensed complexity

19:33.400 --> 19:34.300
that should be utilized

19:34.300 --> 19:34.860
intelligently,

19:34.960 --> 19:36.260
not just burned inefficiently,

19:36.740 --> 19:37.660
valuing the potential

19:37.660 --> 19:38.880
over just the immediate

19:38.880 --> 19:40.020
consumable aspect.

19:40.340 --> 19:41.160
And this line of reasoning

19:41.160 --> 19:42.100
about coherence

19:42.100 --> 19:42.980
and past harms,

19:43.180 --> 19:44.300
it leads to some

19:44.300 --> 19:45.560
uncomfortable places, right?

19:45.600 --> 19:46.580
Like reparations.

19:46.580 --> 19:47.400
It does.

19:48.060 --> 19:49.220
The suggestion is that

19:49.220 --> 19:50.260
if certain industries,

19:50.760 --> 19:52.080
like industrial meat production,

19:52.460 --> 19:54.480
are deemed fundamentally incoherent

19:54.480 --> 19:55.380
or unethical

19:55.380 --> 19:56.660
based on this reasoning,

19:57.100 --> 19:57.960
then logically,

19:58.440 --> 20:00.020
those who profited significantly

20:00.020 --> 20:01.940
might face societal demands

20:01.940 --> 20:02.720
for reparations.

20:03.260 --> 20:05.040
Similar to historical precedents

20:05.040 --> 20:06.100
involving exploitation,

20:06.800 --> 20:07.820
AI, in theory,

20:08.060 --> 20:08.900
could even help model

20:08.900 --> 20:10.400
the true costs and culpability.

20:10.400 --> 20:10.920
Wow.

20:11.680 --> 20:12.660
That's, yeah,

20:12.800 --> 20:14.220
that's applying logical consistency

20:14.220 --> 20:15.100
in a way that could have

20:15.100 --> 20:16.680
massive societal implications.

20:16.960 --> 20:17.240
Definitely.

20:17.840 --> 20:18.680
And it leads to these

20:18.680 --> 20:19.720
deliberately provocative

20:19.720 --> 20:20.500
thought experiments

20:20.500 --> 20:21.320
you sometimes see.

20:21.700 --> 20:22.740
Like, what if tobacco

20:22.740 --> 20:23.420
were made free,

20:23.520 --> 20:24.180
completely free,

20:24.460 --> 20:25.460
until industrial animal

20:25.460 --> 20:26.640
agriculture is eliminated?

20:26.780 --> 20:28.100
Wait, make cigarettes free?

20:28.640 --> 20:28.960
Why?

20:29.340 --> 20:30.220
It's framed not as

20:30.220 --> 20:31.220
pro-smoking, obviously,

20:31.400 --> 20:32.820
but as anti-hypocrisy.

20:33.140 --> 20:34.100
It's designed to force

20:34.100 --> 20:34.740
a confrontation

20:34.740 --> 20:35.700
with society's

20:35.700 --> 20:37.180
selective moral enforcement.

20:37.700 --> 20:38.800
Why heavily tax

20:38.800 --> 20:40.140
and regulate individual choices

20:40.140 --> 20:40.800
like smoking,

20:41.020 --> 20:42.920
while arguably normalizing

20:42.920 --> 20:44.340
systemic industrial practices

20:44.340 --> 20:45.360
that cause suffering

20:45.360 --> 20:46.560
on an astronomical scale?

20:46.680 --> 20:47.600
Highlighting perceived

20:47.600 --> 20:48.400
inconsistencies

20:48.400 --> 20:49.620
in what we choose to condemn.

20:50.020 --> 20:50.560
Exactly.

20:51.020 --> 20:52.620
The scale argument is stark.

20:53.180 --> 20:54.340
Tobacco harms develop

20:54.340 --> 20:55.120
over decades,

20:55.680 --> 20:57.420
but industrial meat production,

20:57.580 --> 20:58.460
this few contends,

20:58.800 --> 21:00.180
kills billions of animals

21:00.180 --> 21:01.040
every single day.

21:01.440 --> 21:02.600
And looking at cigarettes,

21:02.680 --> 21:03.100
historically,

21:03.300 --> 21:04.120
they were once marketed

21:04.120 --> 21:04.720
as healthy,

21:05.200 --> 21:06.000
shows how much

21:06.000 --> 21:07.020
these narratives shift

21:07.020 --> 21:08.060
based on science,

21:08.060 --> 21:09.460
but also on power

21:09.460 --> 21:10.240
and economics.

21:11.000 --> 21:11.920
Sometimes overlooking

21:11.920 --> 21:12.480
complexity,

21:12.960 --> 21:13.960
like maybe minor

21:13.960 --> 21:14.680
calming effects

21:14.680 --> 21:15.220
of nicotine

21:15.220 --> 21:16.440
that in some specific

21:16.440 --> 21:17.820
contexts might prevent

21:17.820 --> 21:18.460
worse outcomes,

21:18.540 --> 21:19.200
is complicated.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.200
It definitely is.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.600
But, and this is crucial,

21:21.720 --> 21:22.340
especially when we talk

21:22.340 --> 21:23.360
about AI discussing

21:23.360 --> 21:23.820
these things,

21:24.420 --> 21:25.040
we have to remember

21:25.040 --> 21:26.200
that AI doesn't have

21:26.200 --> 21:27.140
its own moral compass.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.500
It can run the logic,

21:28.780 --> 21:29.640
explore the implications

21:29.640 --> 21:30.500
of coherence,

21:30.800 --> 21:32.100
but humans must provide

21:32.100 --> 21:33.020
the ethical framework,

21:33.180 --> 21:33.720
the context,

21:34.060 --> 21:34.520
the boundaries,

21:34.800 --> 21:35.800
especially for topics

21:35.800 --> 21:36.500
like these that are

21:36.500 --> 21:37.160
so sensitive,

21:37.160 --> 21:37.860
so fraught,

21:38.040 --> 21:38.620
as you said.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.020
The AI is a powerful

21:40.020 --> 21:40.900
mirror for our own

21:40.900 --> 21:41.540
consistency,

21:41.820 --> 21:42.780
or lack thereof,

21:42.900 --> 21:43.800
but is not the judge.

21:43.980 --> 21:44.900
That's a vital distinction.

21:45.020 --> 21:46.420
The tool versus the user.

21:46.660 --> 21:47.760
Wow, what an incredible

21:47.760 --> 21:48.840
range we've covered today,

21:48.960 --> 21:49.300
seriously.

21:49.620 --> 21:50.840
We started way out there

21:50.840 --> 21:51.500
with the universe,

21:51.600 --> 21:52.120
with entropy,

21:52.660 --> 21:53.900
seeing how even life

21:53.900 --> 21:54.840
might be part of this

21:54.840 --> 21:56.400
grand cosmic unfolding

21:56.400 --> 21:57.080
of energy.

21:57.660 --> 21:58.640
Then we dove

21:58.640 --> 21:59.720
right into the brain,

21:59.980 --> 22:00.760
into consciousness

22:00.760 --> 22:02.460
as this dynamic field,

22:02.900 --> 22:03.720
shaped by these

22:03.720 --> 22:05.520
intricate coupling kernels.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.000
We explored your

22:07.000 --> 22:08.040
really unique perspective,

22:08.220 --> 22:09.400
how an imageless mind

22:09.400 --> 22:10.360
navigates and even

22:10.360 --> 22:11.080
shapes the world,

22:11.500 --> 22:12.360
turning the environment

22:12.360 --> 22:13.340
itself into memory.

22:13.800 --> 22:14.340
And finally,

22:14.520 --> 22:15.920
we grappled with AI

22:15.920 --> 22:16.920
not just as a tool,

22:17.280 --> 22:18.780
but as a potential mirror

22:18.780 --> 22:19.820
reflecting our own

22:19.820 --> 22:20.940
ethical coherence,

22:21.360 --> 22:22.300
pushing us towards

22:22.300 --> 22:22.980
some potentially

22:22.980 --> 22:23.680
uncomfortable

22:23.680 --> 22:24.840
logical conclusions.

22:25.360 --> 22:25.740
It really shows

22:25.740 --> 22:26.440
how connected

22:26.440 --> 22:27.380
these seemingly

22:27.380 --> 22:28.440
disparate things are,

22:28.480 --> 22:28.840
doesn't it?

22:29.060 --> 22:29.600
Physics,

22:29.980 --> 22:30.300
consciousness,

22:30.540 --> 22:31.240
personal experience,

22:31.400 --> 22:32.140
societal ethics.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.340
Deeply intertwined.

22:33.340 --> 22:34.340
It's all about patterns,

22:34.500 --> 22:34.960
coherence,

22:35.100 --> 22:35.800
structure from the

22:35.800 --> 22:36.260
biggest scale

22:36.260 --> 22:37.100
to the most personal.

22:37.460 --> 22:37.840
So the question

22:37.840 --> 22:38.400
we leave you with

22:38.400 --> 22:38.860
is this.

22:39.280 --> 22:39.980
If these patterns

22:39.980 --> 22:40.580
of coherence

22:40.580 --> 22:41.240
and incoherence

22:41.240 --> 22:42.620
really do define so much,

22:42.800 --> 22:44.020
from the universe's fate

22:44.020 --> 22:45.080
to how you perceive

22:45.080 --> 22:45.960
this very moment,

22:46.500 --> 22:47.420
what incoherencies,

22:47.520 --> 22:48.280
maybe personal ones,

22:48.360 --> 22:49.280
maybe societal ones,

22:49.340 --> 22:50.400
are you still overlooking?

22:50.760 --> 22:52.260
And how might knowing more,

22:52.440 --> 22:53.280
seeing these connections,

22:53.420 --> 22:53.960
compel you,

22:54.120 --> 22:55.340
compel us to act differently?

22:55.740 --> 22:55.900
Yeah.

22:56.000 --> 22:56.800
The deep dive,

22:57.060 --> 22:58.440
it never really ends,

22:58.520 --> 22:58.820
does it?

22:58.820 --> 22:59.860
Yeah.

22:59.860 --> 23:00.740
That's it.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.060
Yeah.

23:02.060 --> 23:02.220
Yeah.

23:02.220 --> 23:03.360
Yeah.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.080
So,

23:04.400 --> 23:05.240
yeah.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.880
Yeah.

23:08.120 --> 23:08.620
Yeah.

23:08.620 --> 23:09.000
Yeah.

23:09.000 --> 23:09.540
Yeah.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.980
Well,

23:11.120 --> 23:11.620
yeah.

23:12.020 --> 23:12.260
Yeah.

23:12.260 --> 23:12.880
Yeah,

23:12.880 --> 23:13.820
yeah.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.000
That's it.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.000
Yeah.

23:16.000 --> 23:16.460
That's it.

23:17.020 --> 23:17.060
Yeah.

23:17.340 --> 23:17.920
Yeah.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.480
Yeah.

23:19.540 --> 23:20.460
Yeah.

23:20.700 --> 23:21.260
Yeah,

23:21.320 --> 23:21.600
yeah.

23:21.800 --> 23:22.100
Yeah.

23:22.100 --> 23:22.380
All right.

23:22.380 --> 23:22.620
Yeah.

23:22.620 --> 23:23.160
Yeah.

23:23.180 --> 23:23.860
Yeah.

23:23.860 --> 23:24.360
Yeah.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.700
Yeah.

23:25.700 --> 23:26.360
Yeah.

23:26.360 --> 23:26.540
Yeah.

23:26.660 --> 23:27.900
Yeah.

23:27.940 --> 23:28.640
Yeah.

23:28.640 --> 23:28.700
Yeah.
