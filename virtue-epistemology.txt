Title: "Reliabilism and Virtue Epistemology: A Defense"

This book, authored by Ernest Sosa, is a comprehensive exploration of two significant theories in epistemology (the study of knowledge): Reliabilism and Virtue Epistemology. Here's a detailed summary of its main parts:

1. **Preface**: Sosa provides an overview of his intention behind writing the book - to defend Virtue Reliabilism, a combination of Reliabilism and Virtue Epistemology, against common criticisms.

2. **Introduction**: Sosa introduces the central themes of the book, explaining how he plans to argue for the compatibility and superiority of Virtue Reliabilism over other prominent theories of knowledge.

3. **1: Process Reliabilism**
   This chapter delves into Process Reliabilism, one of the two main theories discussed in the book. It explains how this theory characterizes knowledge as justified true belief (JTB) where the belief-forming process is reliable - that is, it typically produces more truth than falsehood. Sosa discusses various forms and criticisms of Process Reliabilism.

4. **2: Virtue Reliabilism: Justified Belief**
   Here, Sosa introduces the concept of Virtue Epistemology, which focuses on intellectual virtues (like open-mindedness, carefulness) and vices (like hastiness, prejudice). He argues that these virtues can be reliably exercised, making Virtue Reliabilism a plausible theory of knowledge.

5. **3: Virtue Reliabilism: Knowledge**
   In this section, Sosa deepens his argument by showing how intellectual virtues can give rise to knowledge, not just justified belief. He discusses the role of 'intellectual autobiography' - reflecting on one's own intellectual history and assessing one's past performance of intellectual virtues - in acquiring knowledge.

6. **4: Knowledge First Virtue Reliabilism**
   This chapter presents a novel version of Virtue Reliabilism, 'Knowledge First'. Sosa argues that knowledge is prior to justification and belief; understanding this primacy of knowledge helps in reconciling Virtue Epistemology with Reliabilism.

7. **5: The Competition**
   In the final substantive chapter, Sosa contrasts his Virtue Reliabilism with other significant epistemological views (like Goldman's Reliabilism and BonJour’s Foundationalism) and argues for its superiority based on its ability to handle various philosophical puzzles and data better.

**Appendices**: These include detailed analyses of the 'Safety Dilemma' and 'Lottery Cases', two thought experiments often used to test epistemological theories.

The book concludes with a Bibliography and Index for further study and reference. 

Sosa's main argument throughout is that Virtue Reliabilism offers a more comprehensive, flexible, and intuitive account of knowledge than its competitors by integrating intellectual virtues into a reliabilist framework. He contends that this combination can address several shortcomings of both standalone Reliabilism and Virtue Epistemology.

"Good Thinking: A Knowledge-First Approach to Virtue Reliabilism" by Christoph Kelp presents a unique fusion of two epistemological theories - virtue reliabilism and knowledge-first epistemology. This book aims to create fresh perspectives on the understanding of knowledge and justified belief.

1. **Virtue Reliabilism**: This theory posits that an agent knows or has a justified belief when their cognitive faculties, or intellectual virtues, are reliable. In other words, knowing is not merely about having true beliefs but having beliefs resulting from trustworthy mental processes or abilities.

2. **Knowledge-First Epistemology**: Contrary to traditional virtue reliabilism that breaks down epistemic ability into forming true beliefs, this approach defines it as the capacity to know (possess knowledge). It introduces a definition of justified belief in terms of knowledge, rather than truth or reliability alone.

The book's central argument is that combining these two theories offers novel solutions to core epistemological problems. By defining epistemic ability in terms of knowing instead of true-belief generation, it provides a more robust and insightful account of justified belief and knowledge.

Key contributions of Kelp's "Good Thinking" include:

- **Novel Account of Justified Belief**: The book proposes a new way to understand justified beliefs by linking them directly to knowledge, diverging from the typical true-belief or reliability-based definitions.
  
- **Resolution of Epistemological Issues**: Kelp claims his approach provides fresh perspectives on longstanding epistemological puzzles, such as Gettier problems and skepticism, surpassing other forms of virtue reliabilism.

- **Interdisciplinary Relevance**: This work bridges the gap between analytic and continental philosophy, appealing to both virtue reliabilists (traditional and knowledge-first) and contributing significantly to contemporary debates in epistemology.

Christoph Kelp, the author, is a recognized figure in epistemological circles. His work has been published in prestigious philosophy journals like Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Noûs, Synthese, and the Journal of Philosophy. Recognized with the 2017 Young Epistemologist Prize, Kelp's expertise and innovative approach make "Good Thinking" a significant addition to philosophical literature.


### x02

"Good Thinking: A Knowledge First Virtue Epistemology" by Christoph Kelp is a philosophical exploration of the concept of knowledge, specifically focusing on virtue reliabilism - the idea that knowledge is an achievement due to competence. The book presents an innovative approach, proposing that the success relevant to knowledge should be considered as safety rather than truth.

The author, Christoph Kelp, expresses his initial fascination with virtue reliabilism during his PhD and his subsequent dissatisfaction with existing attempts to resolve issues like fake barn cases (scenarios designed to challenge epistemological views). These cases pose problems for reliabilism because they involve beliefs formed through reliable processes that lead to false conclusions. 

Kelp's book unfolds in five chapters, each building upon the previous one:

1. **Process Reliabilism**: Kelp introduces reliabilism, an epistemological theory suggesting that a belief counts as knowledge if it is produced by a reliable process. Despite its appeal, this view faces challenges, particularly with cases like fake barn scenarios.

2. **Virtue Reliabilism: Justified Belief**: Here, Kelp discusses virtue reliabilism, which posits that a belief's justification comes from the thinker's intellectual virtues (excellences of character) and reliable processes. This approach aims to overcome limitations of process reliabilism by incorporating character traits.

3. **Virtue Reliabilism: Knowledge**: In this chapter, Kelp delves into how virtue reliabilism can be extended to define knowledge. He argues that for a belief to count as knowledge, it must not only result from a reliable process but also reflect intellectual virtues.

4. **Knowledge First Virtue Reliabilism**: This is the core contribution of Kelp's book. He proposes that the success central to knowing—the target we aim for with our cognitive endeavors—should be safety (avoiding error) rather than truth. This "knowledge first" virtue reliabilism recasts the nature of epistemic success and provides a novel solution to problems like fake barn cases.

5. **The Competition**: Kelp engages with other prominent epistemological views, demonstrating how his knowledge-first virtue reliabilism competes favorably.

Throughout the book, Kelp also includes appendices and bibliographical references supporting his arguments. He acknowledges the input of numerous colleagues, friends, and family members for their support and valuable feedback during the development of this work. 

In essence, "Good Thinking" offers a fresh perspective on epistemology by advocating for safety as the key success in knowing within a virtue reliabilist framework. This approach not only resolves long-standing issues but also broadens our understanding of intellectual virtues and their role in acquiring knowledge.

Process Reliabilism (PR) is a prominent view in epistemology that explains justified belief in terms of reliable processes. According to PR, a belief is justified if it results from a belief-independent process that is unconditionally reliable or from a belief-dependent process that is conditionally reliable, given that the input beliefs are true.

Key aspects of PR include:

1. Non-factivity: PR allows for the possibility of justified false beliefs, as reliable processes can produce false beliefs due to their fallibility.
2. Truth conduciveness: Justified beliefs, according to PR, are more likely to be true than not, as they result from reliable processes with a higher conditional probability of truth.
3. Paradigm cases: PR correctly classifies justified and unjustified beliefs, such as those produced by reliable perception, introspection, memory, and reasoning versus unreliable processes like confused reasoning, guesswork, and wishful thinking.
4. Solutions to key problems in epistemology:
   a. Agrippa's Trilemma: PR offers an appealing foundationalist solution by justifying basic beliefs produced by reliable processes while excluding unjustified ones from circular or infinite chains of justification.
   b. Skepticism: PR resists skeptical arguments by maintaining that it is possible for our beliefs, including those about radical deception, to be reliably produced and thus justified.

However, PR also faces well-known problems:

1. The New Evil Demon Problem: This problem challenges the adequacy of PR in dealing with scenarios where a malevolent being manipulates our belief-forming processes without us knowing it. In such cases, even reliable processes might lead to false beliefs due to manipulation, undermining PR's ability to justify beliefs accurately.

This summary explains the core ideas and implications of Process Reliabilism (PR) as a theory of justified belief, highlighting its benefits and challenges in addressing key problems in epistemology.


### x04

Virtue Reliabilism (VR) is a theory of justified belief that builds on the concept of performance normativity. Performance normativity is a framework for evaluating performances with a goal, which can be assessed along three dimensions: success, competence, and achievement. Success refers to whether the performance reaches its goal; competence, whether the agent performs using an ability to attain that success; and achievement, whether the performance qualifies as such because of being both successful and competent.

In VR, beliefs are considered epistemic performances with a specific goal: truth. This allows for the application of the general account of performance normativity to belief, providing an account of the normativity of belief. Key concepts in this framework include:

1. Successful Belief: A belief is successful if and only if it is true. In other words, a belief reaches its goal (truth) when it accurately represents reality.
2. Competent Belief: A belief is competent if and only if it is produced by an exercise of an ability to form true beliefs. This means that the belief-forming process relies on skills, abilities, or virtues that lead to accurate representations of the world. Competence does not necessarily imply truth; rather, it refers to the use of reliable methods or processes in forming beliefs.
3. Apt Belief: An apt belief is one that is true because competent. This means that the belief's truth derives from its being formed through a reliable and competent process. In other words, an apt belief is not only true but also arrived at in a way that reflects the exercising of appropriate abilities or virtues.

In summary, VR posits that justified beliefs are those that are successful (true), competent (formed through reliable processes or abilities), and apt (true because competent). This framework emphasizes the importance of not only the truth of a belief but also the reliability and appropriateness of the belief-forming process in determining justification.


### x05

The text presents a detailed account of competent moves within Simple Goal Practices (SGPs) and applies this framework to the case of belief, specifically epistemic abilities and justified belief. Here's a summary and explanation of the key points:

1. **Simple Goal Practices (SGPs):** SGPs are structured activities with specific targets, moves, and designated properties. For example, archery is an SGP where the target is hitting the bullseye, moves are releasing arrows, and the designated property is accuracy.

2. **SGP Abilities:** An agent has an ability to attain success in a range of SGPs (RS) and relative to conditions (RC) if they have a grounded way of move production (W), such that using W in any condition C from RC disposes them to achieve success in any SGP S within RS.

3. **Exercises of SGP Abilities:** To exercise an ability, the agent must use their grounded way of move production (W) under conditions where it disposes them to produce successful moves. Some conditions (SH) prevent the use of W, while others (SI) do not.

4. **Competent Moves:** A move in an SGP is competent if it's produced by exercising an ability to attain success within a range of SGPs and relative to conditions. The SGP must be within the range of the exercised ability for the move to be competent.

5. **Application to Belief:** Inquiry into specific propositions is understood as an SGP, with true answers as targets, beliefs as moves, and truth as the designated property. Successful beliefs are those formed by reliable ways of belief formation (epistemic abilities).

6. **Justified Belief (VR-JB*):** A belief is justified if it's competent, i.e., formed by exercising an epistemic ability to form true beliefs about propositions within a range and relative to conditions. This account implicitly includes a reliable process condition, as epistemic abilities require reliable ways of belief formation.

The text also discusses how this version of virtue reliabilism (VR) addresses two key problems for process reliabilism:

- **New Evil Demon Problem:** VR avoids this problem by requiring that an agent's way of move production be grounded, meaning it has been historically designed or learned in conditions necessary to completing the mechanisms for past successes. This grounding condition distinguishes genuine abilities from mere dispositions.

- **Problem of Clairvoyant Cases:** VR addresses this problem by requiring that an agent's way of belief formation be reliable and grounded, as per the epistemic ability definition. In clairvoyant cases, while the belief-forming process may be highly reliable, it might not be grounded in conditions necessary for past successes, thus potentially rendering the beliefs formed unjustified according to VR-JB*.

The text does not explicitly address other problems for process reliabilism, such as the generality problem and the problem of world-bound reliability, but it implies that VR's focus on grounded ways of move production and reliable epistemic abilities could help mitigate these issues.


### x06

The text discusses two accounts of aptness (or apt belief) to address the creditworthiness dilemma in the context of virtue reliabilism (VR), a view that knowledge is a form of reliable true belief. The dilemma arises from the challenge of distinguishing between Gettier cases (beliefs that are luckily true) and standard testimonial knowledge, which both involve successful and competent but non-apt performances.

1. Ability Manifestation Account: This account, proposed by Keith DeRose, suggests that a belief is apt if its success manifests the agent's complete ability. A complete ability consists of three components: seat (SE), shape (SH), and situation (SI). The SE represents the agent's dispositional properties; SH corresponds to homonymous conditions in abilities; and SI refers to situational factors. For a belief to be apt, all three components must be satisfied. In Gettier cases, the SI is often not met, leading to non-apt beliefs. However, in standard testimonial knowledge cases, the SI is typically satisfied, resulting in apt beliefs.

2. Precisified Ability Manifestation Account: This version refines the previous account by stating that a move (or belief) in an SGP (a system of intellectual virtues and practices) is apt if it is successful, competent, and its SI is satisfied. Apt beliefs are those that are true, competent, and have satisfied SI conditions for the epistemic ability exercised.

The text also introduces Fake Barn Cases to challenge the claim that Gettier cases are instances of tarnished moves in inquiry. These cases involve an agent who has a reliable belief-forming process but ends up with a false belief due to an unusual turn of events (e.g., discovering a fake barn instead of the intended farm). The challenge is whether such cases should be considered Gettier cases or not, as they do not fit the traditional pattern of two strokes of luck cancelling out each other's effects.

In summary, the text presents two accounts of aptness to address the creditworthiness dilemma in VR. The Ability Manifestation Account posits that a belief is apt if its success manifests the agent's complete ability, with all SE, SH, and SI components satisfied. The Precisified Ability Manifestation Account refines this by stating that a move (or belief) in an SGP is apt if it is successful, competent, and its SI is satisfied. Fake Barn Cases are introduced to question whether all Gettier cases can be considered tarnished moves in inquiry, as they may not fit the traditional pattern of two strokes of luck cancelling out each other's effects.


### x07

The text discusses the problem of explaining why we cannot know or justifiably believe lottery propositions, such as "all tickets will lose" in a fair lottery with n tickets and one winner. The author argues that two common strategies for accounting for this phenomenon—inaptness and incompetence—are problematic.

1. Inaptness: This strategy claims that beliefs about lottery propositions are successful and competent but not apt, i.e., they fall short of being justified or reliable. However, the author shows that this approach is unsatisfactory due to the lottery paradox, which reveals that lottery propositions aren't even justifiably believable. Since knowledge entails justified belief, the absence of knowledge is already explained by the absence of justified belief, making the inaptness account redundant.
2. Incompetence: This strategy argues that we lack the epistemic abilities required for competent belief about lottery propositions. However, the author points out that it is very plausible that beliefs in lottery propositions are frequently produced by abilities to form true beliefs about lottery outcomes. Therefore, this approach faces significant challenges in explaining why we cannot know or justifiably believe lottery propositions.

The author also discusses the lottery paradox, which arises from the apparent inconsistency between three principles: Sufficiency Thesis (ST), Conjunction Closure (CC), and No Contradictions (NC). The paradox can be resolved by rejecting CC, as aggregation of justifiably believable propositions may lead to an unacceptable risk of error. However, the author argues that this diagnosis is ultimately unsatisfactory because the paradox can still be generated in a way that bypasses CC.

The Minimal Coherence, Justification (MCH-J) principle is introduced as a variation of MCH, which states that if one knows that the conclusion of an argument one knows to be valid is not justifiably believable, then some premise of the argument is not justifiably believable. MCH-J is inconsistent with ST, leading the author to conclude that ST must be false. Consequently, there is independent theoretical reason to believe that we cannot even justifiably believe lottery propositions.

In light of this, the author argues that the remaining strategy for virtue reliabilists—claiming that beliefs in lottery propositions are not competent—faces significant challenges. The prospects for demonstrating incompetence are dim due to the plausibility of abilities forming true beliefs about lottery outcomes. The author concludes that accounting for our inability to know or justifiably believe lottery propositions remains a challenging problem for virtue reliabilism.


### x08

The text presents an analysis of virtue reliabilism (VR) within epistemology and introduces a knowledge-first alternative to address certain problems faced by traditional VR. The author discusses three main issues with traditional VR: the creditworthiness dilemma, the safety dilemma, and difficulties with lottery cases.

1. Creditworthiness Dilemma: The proposed version of VR can avoid this problem, unlike others in the literature. This dilemma concerns how to reconcile the reliability of a belief-forming process with the possibility that an agent's abilities are underdeveloped or not fully utilized.

2. Safety Dilemma: The author argues that traditional VR struggles with handling certain Gettier-style counterexamples, such as Fake Barns cases. To address standard Gettier cases, VR champions incorporate a safety condition, but this leads to overgenerality, incorrectly predicting the absence of knowledge in Frankfurt cases and other scenarios where intuitions suggest knowledge is present.

3. Lottery Cases: The author contends that traditional VR has difficulty explaining why beliefs in lottery propositions (e.g., "I will win the lottery") are not justifiably held, let alone known. Attempts to utilize structural properties as defeaters for these propositions have been shown to be unsuccessful by Douven and Williamson (2006).

The author then introduces a knowledge-first virtue reliabilism (KFVR) as an alternative that can potentially overcome these issues. KFVR modifies the designated property in inquiry from truth to knowledge, leading to the following key changes:

a) Abilities to know propositions are defined by having a grounded way of belief formation that disposes one to form knowledgeable beliefs about the relevant range of propositions.

b) Competent beliefs are those formed through exercises of abilities to know, where the target proposition is within the range and appropriate conditions are met.

c) Apt beliefs require successful, competent belief formation, with the satisfaction of situational conditions for the ability exercised.

d) Justified belief (KFVR-JB) is identified as competent belief, while knowledge (KFVR-K) is apt belief. The circular nature of KFVR-K is acknowledged but justified by its fit with other practices like joining consenting adults in lawful marriage (LM), where success requires both competence and satisfaction of situational conditions.

The author argues that KFVR maintains the spirit of knowledge first epistemology while potentially offering a more satisfactory account of justification and knowledge within virtue reliabilism, especially regarding Gettier-style cases and lottery scenarios.


### x09

Alan Millar's version of knowledge first virtue reliabilism is motivated by the observation that our everyday use of the concept of knowledge does not require complex analytical conditions. Instead, we often consider someone to know a fact based on their perceptual ability to identify it through its appearance or other sensory characteristics. Millar's view defines knowledge as success in inquiry, specifically focusing on perceptual abilities.

Millar argues that our everyday judgments about knowledge do not rely on intricate conditions found in analytical philosophy. For instance, we readily accept that someone knows a particular object is a certain type (e.g., an F) based on their visual perception alone, without requiring detailed epistemic analysis. At the conceptual level of everyday knowledge, we recognize knowing through perception by means of an ability to discern facts from sensory appearances or other characteristics.

Millar's view is knowledge first because it identifies knowledge with success in inquiry, specifically focusing on the perceptual abilities that enable someone to identify and categorize objects accurately based on their appearance or other sensory features. This approach contrasts with traditional virtue reliabilism, which typically defines justified belief as competent belief and knowledge as apt belief, using complex epistemic conditions.

In summary, Millar's knowledge first virtue reliabilism emphasizes the perceptual abilities that allow individuals to identify and categorize objects accurately based on their sensory characteristics, reflecting our everyday use of the concept of knowledge in a more straightforward manner than traditional analytical conditions.


### x10

The text discusses two knowledge first accounts of justified belief, proposed by Miracchi and the author (referred to as "KFVR"), and their responses to the new Gettier problem.

1. Miracchi's view:
   - Miracchi argues that agents in fake barn cases lack the relevant competence to recognize barns due to hostile environmental conditions, which prevents them from having justified beliefs.
   - She distinguishes between abilities and competences, claiming that exercises of ability need only make success possible, while exercises of competence must make success likely.
   - Miracchi's view predicts that beliefs formed under precarious conditions (like fake barn cases) are unjustified because the likelihood of success is too low.

2. KFVR's view:
   - KFVR offers a uniform treatment of both standard Gettier cases and fake barn cases without construing justified belief as a disjunctive kind.
   - KFVR argues that agents in Gettier cases have justified beliefs based on independent theoretical reasons, such as reliability with respect to knowledge.

3. Comparison and critique:
   - Miracchi's view is more complex due to the distinction between manifestations and exercises of competences, an account of degenerate exercises, and a disjunctive account of justified belief.
   - KFVR's view avoids these complexities and provides a uniform treatment of Gettier cases.
   - Miracchi's positive argument for her view targets certain virtue epistemological accounts of knowledge, but it is unclear why her proposed property (being identical with an exercise of a competence to know) should be identified with justified belief over other properties that give beliefs positive epistemic status.
   - Miracchi's account may face empirical adequacy and theoretical virtue challenges, such as simplicity, uniformity, and elegance, compared to other views like KFVR's.

In conclusion, while Miracchi's view offers some considerations in support of her position, KFVR's view provides a more straightforward and uniform treatment of justified belief without the need for additional complexity or separate treatments for different types of Gettier cases. However, Miracchi's positive argument may still hold merit against rival views, potentially making her approach more appealing despite its drawbacks.


### x11

The text discusses three prominent virtue epistemologists' approaches to lottery cases, such as Lottery Loser and No Winner, and their attempts to reconcile these cases with the safety principle, which is a central component of anti-luck virtue epistemology (ALVE).

1. **Craig (2013)** proposes a contextual approach to the lottery paradox. He argues that the safety principle should be understood as applying within specific contexts or "lotteries." According to Craig, in Lottery Loser, the relevant context is the set of all possible tickets, where the safety principle does not apply due to the sheer number of false beliefs. In No Winner, however, the context is narrowed down to a smaller group of tickets, making it more plausible that the safety principle holds. Craig contends that justification and knowledge are context-dependent, and thus, in Lottery Loser, there is no justification for believing the lottery proposition, and consequently, no knowledge.
2. **Pritchard (2013)** offers a sliding scale account of safety, which adjusts the tolerance for false beliefs at nearby worlds based on their proximity to actuality. He argues that, in Lottery Loser, the number of nearby worlds where the lottery proposition is false is so high that it violates the safety principle. Pritchard claims that this violation undermines justification and knowledge. In No Winner, however, the number of nearby worlds with false beliefs is lower, making it more plausible that the safety principle holds, and thus, justification and knowledge are present.
3. **Zagzebski (2015)** presents a two-tiered account of the safety principle. She distinguishes between "basic" and "advanced" cognitive abilities. Basic abilities are those that are generally reliable across contexts, while advanced abilities may require specific conditions for reliable performance. In Lottery Loser, Zagzebski argues that the lottery proposition does not meet the safety principle's standards for basic cognitive abilities due to the vast number of false beliefs at nearby worlds. Consequently, justification and knowledge are absent. In No Winner, the smaller group of tickets allows the lottery proposition to meet the safety principle's requirements for basic cognitive abilities, granting justification and knowledge.

In summary, these virtue epistemologists attempt to address the apparent absence of knowledge in lottery cases by refining or modifying the safety principle. Craig focuses on context-dependency, Pritchard introduces a sliding scale, and Zagzebski proposes a two-tiered account of cognitive abilities. Each approach aims to explain why justification and knowledge seem absent in Lottery Loser while present in No Winner, ultimately preserving the safety principle's role in anti-luck virtue epistemology.


### x12

The passage discusses critiques of three different philosophical theories regarding knowledge and belief, specifically in relation to "lottery cases" where one believes that a randomly selected ticket will not win a lottery. The three theories are those of Michael Sosa, John Greco, and Ernest Sosa (referred to as ALVE).

1. **Michael Sosa's Theory**: Sosa argues that we do know in such lottery cases despite common intuitions suggesting otherwise. He presents linguistic evidence from casual speech where people might say "you never know" or "you should have known." However, the critique points out that these statements don't necessarily reflect accurate knowledge-claims upon closer examination. Sosa also proposes an error theory, suggesting we confuse safety (the true condition for knowledge) with sensitivity (a false condition). Critics argue this theory fails to account for why we correctly judge knowledge in some cases (like the bad apple case) but incorrectly so in lottery cases.

2. **John Greco's Theory**: Greco posits that apt beliefs, i.e., those epistemically justified by salient ability, can be undermined by "salient luck." In lottery cases, this luck is seen as inherent to the idea of a lottery (chance). Critics counter with a rigged lottery scenario where no ticket wins due to predetermination. In such a case, luck isn't salient since the outcome was fixed, not chance-driven, challenging Greco's theory.

3. **ALVE (Ernest Sosa's Virtue Epistemology)**: This view states that a belief is knowledge if it's produced by an epistemic virtue or ability under the right conditions. However, ALVE struggles with lottery cases as it seems to either incorrectly predict lack of knowledge in safe but unlucky beliefs (like the bad apple case), or it fails to account for clear instances where luck is not salient (like rigged lotteries).

In summary, each theory faces challenges in accurately capturing our intuitions about knowledge in lottery scenarios. Sosa's linguistic evidence and error theory are questioned, Greco's focus on salient luck is challenged by cases where luck isn't prominent, and ALVE's virtue-based account struggles with both safe, unlucky beliefs (bad apple) and situations where luck plays no role. These critiques suggest that while these theories offer valuable insights, they each fall short in comprehensively explaining our intuitions about knowledge in such complex scenarios.

This list represents a selection of influential works in the field of contemporary epistemology, a branch of philosophy concerned with understanding the nature of knowledge. Here's a brief summary and explanation of some key themes, authors, and ideas presented in these texts:

1. **Reliabilism**: This is a major topic within contemporary epistemology that focuses on the reliability of one's cognitive faculties as a basis for knowledge. Goldman (2012) provides an extensive overview, while Greco (1999, 2003a, 2003b, 2007, 2010) contributes to the development of agent reliabilism—the view that knowledge is a matter of being suitably connected to the truth via reliable processes under one's control.

2. **Virtue Epistemology**: This approach emphasizes intellectual virtues (e.g., open-mindedness, carefulness) as central to understanding knowledge and justification. Key contributors include Greco (1999, 2000), Zagzebski (1994, 1996), and Pritchard (2005, 2007, 2008, 2012a, 2012b, 2013, 2014, 2017). A central idea is that knowledge involves not just true belief but also adequate intellectual virtue and the absence of intellectual vice.

3. **Gettier Problems**: These are thought experiments introduced by H.G. Gettier (1963) challenging the long-held view that knowledge is justified true belief. Numerous authors, including Pritchard (2011), Williamson (2000, 2011), and Sosa (2007), have addressed these problems by proposing alternative definitions of knowledge or revising the notion of justification.

4. **Infinitism**: This is an epistemological view that holds there can be infinitely many basic beliefs without any non-basic, higher-level justification. Key proponents include Kelp (2011a, 2013) and Peijnenburg (2007), while critics like Klein (2012, 2014) argue against it due to practical concerns and the regress problem.

5. **Coherentism**: This is an epistemological theory suggesting that justification for beliefs is grounded in their coherence with other beliefs rather than in immediate evidence or foundational beliefs. Lehrer (1974, 1990) and Klein (2012) have explored variations of this approach.

6. **Contextualism**: This view holds that the standards for knowledge can vary with contexts. Littlejohn (2013, 2017) is a key contributor to this area, while Sosa (2007) has critiqued it.

7. **Anti-Luck Epistemology**: This approach argues that getting knowledge right should not depend on luck or factors beyond one's control. Pritchard (2005, 2009, 2012a, 2013) is a significant contributor to this school of thought.

8. **Expressivism about Assertion**: This theory posits that the assertion of knowledge involves not just stating a belief but also expressing one's commitment or confidence in it. Turri (2011, 2016) has developed key ideas related to this topic.

9. **Pragmatic Encroachment**: This idea suggests that practical factors—like the consequences of being wrong—can influence whether a belief counts as knowledge. Riggs (2007, 2009) and Sosa (2015) are among those who have explored this concept.

The texts listed provide an overview of current debates in epistemology, showcasing various perspectives on what knowledge is, how it's acquired, justified, and the role of intellectual virtues, context, luck, and reliability in these processes.

The provided text appears to be an index or outline of key concepts, theorists, and examples related to philosophical discussions surrounding knowledge, belief, ability, and performance. Here's a detailed summary and explanation of the main points:

1. **Abilities (20, 24-28):** Abilities are central to many philosophical discussions about knowledge and belief. They refer to capacities or dispositions to perform actions or achieve outcomes under certain conditions. The text discusses various aspects of abilities, including their levels, grounding conditions, shape, and situational conditions. It also introduces the concept of Specific General Practical (SGP) abilities.

2. **Competence vs Abilities (92-94):** While abilities refer to capacities or dispositions, competence is often understood as a more normative notion - referring to the mastery or proficiency required for something to count as knowledge or justified belief. The distinction between the two is crucial in discussions about what constitutes knowledge and justified belief.

3. **Attribution of Abilities (103-106):** This section likely discusses how we attribute abilities to individuals, including factors like evidence, observation, and inference.

4. **Belief (18-19, 70-71):** Beliefs are mental states where one takes something to be the case. In epistemology, belief is central to discussions about knowledge, justification, and rationality. The text mentions how beliefs function as 'moves in inquiry' and their role in knowledge's success condition.

5. **Examples:** Numerous philosophical thought experiments or examples are mentioned to illustrate various concepts:
   - *Archery*: Used to explore the relationship between ability, luck, and achievement.
   - *Benighted Cognizer*: A hypothetical individual who lacks true beliefs due to poor environmental conditions.
   - *Clairvoyant*: An individual with supposedly accurate perception beyond normal sensory capabilities.
   - *Fake Barn*: A classic gettier case designed to challenge intuitions about knowledge and justification.
   - *Frankfurt Clock*: A thought experiment exploring the relationship between free will, determinism, and moral responsibility.
   - *Gettier Cases*: Scenarios that challenge the traditional analysis of knowledge as justified true belief.
   - *Insanity*: Used to examine the role of rationality in knowledge and justification.
   - *Landmark*: Another gettier-style case involving misleading environmental cues.
   - *Lottery*: Various lottery cases (including the Simple Lottery, Surprise Lottery, and High-Stakes Lottery) are discussed to explore issues of knowledge and risk.
   - *Radical Deception/New Evil Demon Problem*: Hypothetical scenarios posing a skeptical challenge about our ability to know external reality.
   - *Stopped Clock*: A gettier case involving an inaccurate clock that sometimes happens to be right.

6. **Internalism/Externalism Debate (4-5):** This is a fundamental divide in epistemology regarding the nature of justification for beliefs: Internalists argue that factors internal to the believer's mind or experience are necessary for justification, while Externalists claim that external factors (like environmental conditions) can also contribute.

7. **Justified Belief:** This term refers to beliefs that are warranted or appropriately held given available evidence or reasons. Different theories of justification (e.g., reliabilism, coherence theory) offer varying accounts of what constitutes a justified belief.

8. **Knowledge First Approach (66-68, 75, 78, 82-84, 88, 96-97):** This is an epistemological view that prioritizes our intuitions about what counts as knowledge and then theorizes to explain these intuitions, rather than starting with a theory of knowledge and then testing it against cases.

9. **Risk of Error (57-59):** This refers to the possibility of being wrong in one's beliefs or actions due to factors like lack of information, cognitive biases, or environmental influences.

10. **Safety Condition on Knowledge (50, 101, 113-116):** This is a proposed necessary condition for knowledge that involves the absence of significant risk or possibility of error in one's belief-forming process.

11. **Sensitivity Condition on Knowledge (113-114):** Another proposed necessary condition for knowledge, suggesting that a belief counts as knowledge only if it's sensitive to the truth - i.e., if it would depart from truth in any closely adjacent possible world where things are otherwise.

In summary, this index covers a wide range of philosophical concepts and debates revolving around knowledge, belief, ability, and performance. It points towards complex, nuanced discussions that often involve thought experiments and counterexamples to tease out our intuitions about these topics.
