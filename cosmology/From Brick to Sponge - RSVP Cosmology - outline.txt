From Brick to Sponge: RSVP Cosmology and the
Entropic Emergence of Structure
Anonymous Trailblazer
May 2, 2025
Abstract
We propose a novel cosmological framework where gravity emerges from en-
tropy redistribution, modeled through the Recursive Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP)
theory. The early universe transitions from a thermally vibrating "brick" to a scalar-
permeable "sponge," with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) serving as an
entropy field map. We introduce modular engines driving cosmic evolution and out-
line simulation and observational strategies to test the model.

Introduction
The quest for a unified theory of quantum gravity, entropy, and structure formation re-
mains fraught with inconsistencies in standard models like ΛCDM. This paper introduces
RSVP cosmology, where gravity is reinterpreted as thermodynamic smoothing within a
recursive entropic geometry. We outline major contributions, including a novel cosmo-
genesis model and observational validation strategies.

Thermodynamic Foundations of RSVP Cosmology
2.1
Gravity as Entropic Redistribution
Inflationary residue seeds curvature potential, with vacuum expansion and matter col-
lapse acting as entropy transfer mechanisms. This aligns with entropic gravity approaches
(??).
2.2
The Dual-Shell Feedback Model
Inner matter shells collapse inward while outer vacuum shells expand, coupled through
scalar and vector fields via recursive plenum tension. Gravity emerges as curvature
memory encoded in entropy differentials.
2.3
Cosmogenesis: From Brick to Sponge
The early universe begins as a thermally vibrating "brick," with Baryon Acoustic Os-
cillations (BAOs) as energy-exchange resonances. Recombination triggers scalar field
irruption, transitioning to a sponge phase with curvature and intervoidal clumping.

RSVP Framework: Recursive Modules of Cosmic Evolution
3.1
Plenum Architecture and Scalar-Vector Dynamics
A crystal plenum retains inflationary memory, with scalar field Φ, lamphron Λ•, and
lamphrodyne ∆−driving entropic smoothing and curvature generation.
3.2
The Five Modular Engines
• GAS - Gradient Anisotropic Smoothing
• DTR - Deferred Thermodynamic Reservoirs
• PTLR - Poincaré-Triggered Lattice Recrystallization
• SIED - Scalar Irruption via Entropic Differential
• NFR - Neutrino Fossil Registry (CMB entropy traces)

The CMB as Entropic Blueprint
4.1
Rethinking the Cosmic Microwave Background
Cold regions map to entropy reservoirs (voids), while warm regions indicate compres-
sion scars (filaments and walls). BAO imprints form a topological lattice for scalar ten-
sion lines.
4.2
Multipole Alignment and Entropic Shear
Quadrupole and octopole alignments reflect scalar-field fossil stress, with filamentBSL
filament orientation statistics correlating with CMB angular modes.
5
Mathematical Framework and Analogs
5.1
Entropy-Curvature Field Equations
Coupled partial differential equations govern ρm, Φ, σ, S, and v, with the scalar field
inducing curvature via entropy gradient feedback.
5.2
Physical Analog: Paper Mâché in Detergent Water
Pulp represents matter, detergent mimics inflaton residue, and water acts as the scalar
plenum, visualizing curvature relaxation dynamics through surface tension collapse.
6
Simulation Framework and Results
Python-based simulations model scalar-vector plenum dynamics, visualizing matter clus-
tering, void formation, and entropy flow, with parameter sensitivity analysis.
7
Observational Testing Strategy
7.1
CMB-Void Cross-Correlation
Cold spot alignments with underdensity regions validate entropy reservoir predictions.
7.2
Filament Orientation and CMB Multipoles
Structural coherence with quadrupole/octopole axes supports the model.
7.3
Gravitational Weakening and Entropic Saturation
Predictions include curvature flattening and void lensing anomalies.
8
Discussion
RSVP cosmology challenges ΛCDM, holography, and inflationary field theories, offering
implications for dark energy, early structure formation, and a philosophical shift from
force to feedback.
