An academic essay introducing each
ChatGPT said:
Here is a structured academic essay introducing each of your
polycomputation-related projects
, designed as a cohesive yet modular overview suitable for publication or inclusion in a theoretical monograph:
Polycomputational Architectures: An Introduction to Ten Interlinked Research Programs
Abstract:
This essay introduces ten research projects unified by the concept of
polycomputation
‚Äîcomputation understood as a layered, recursive, spatial, and entropic process distributed across physical, symbolic, and cognitive domains. These projects are framed within the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory, a geometric field-theoretic framework proposing that consciousness and computation emerge from the dynamic interplay of scalar, vector, and entropy fields. Each project represents a distinct but interconnected direction, offering a unique lens on polycomputational processes. Collectively, they lay the foundation for a new class of semantic physics, recursive reasoning architectures, and entropic cosmology.
1. RSVP Theory and Field Simulation
At the core of this research program is the
RSVP theory
, a field-theoretic model that describes reality as composed of interacting scalar (Œ¶), vector (ùíó), and entropy (S) fields. The RSVP field simulation platform implements this theory on a discretized lattice, visualizing how meaning and conscious structure arise from recursive entropic relaxation and vectorial flow. The simulator integrates advection-diffusion dynamics, torsion effects, and entropy conservation laws. Polycomputation emerges as concurrent, recursive processing of thermodynamic and geometric data‚Äîcapturing how systems simultaneously evolve along multiple informational dimensions.
2. AKSZ Sigma Models for RSVP
To formalize RSVP's underlying geometry, the
AKSZ construction
is employed‚Äîoriginating from the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) and BRST formalism in topological field theory. This sigma model approach maps RSVP fields into derived stacks and moduli spaces, embedding ghosts, antifields, and (-1)-shifted symplectic structures as computational layers. These algebraic tools encode non-sequential causality and recursive descent, transforming RSVP into a robust geometrical system capable of multi-level evaluation across topological histories. AKSZ thus serves as RSVP's polycomputational skeleton.
3. Attentional Cladistics and Recursive Perceptual Selection
This project explores how biological and cognitive evolution can be reframed as recursive computational systems, where
attention
functions as a distributed selection mechanism.
Attentional cladistics
models evolving lineages‚Äînot merely of organisms, but of ideas, percepts, and behavioral priors‚Äîthrough recursive updates to phylogenetic and semantic trees. This framework allows multi-modal and cross-generational computation, where meaning flows bidirectionally across cultural, neural, and perceptual scales, aligning with RSVP's thermodynamic foundations.
4. L-System Sigma Models and Ethical Rewriting
This line of work merges recursive formal grammars (e.g., L-systems, Gray codes) with sigma models to generate
entropic tiling spaces
governed by ethical constraints. These L-system sigma models produce space-filling computational grammars where symbolic rewriting co-evolves with thermodynamic considerations. Here,
ethicality
is introduced as a filter on computational transformations‚Äîfavoring recursive paths that minimize suffering or maximize coherence. These systems compute simultaneously in physical, symbolic, and normative layers, forming a polycomputational rewriting algebra.
5. Geometric Bayesianism and Sparse Heuristics (GBSH)
GBSH
reformulates Bayesian inference through RSVP's geometric lens, modeling prediction as entropy-driven alignment of sparse priors within vector-scalar fields. This framework captures how living and cognitive systems perform efficient probabilistic updates under resource constraints. Polycomputation manifests through simultaneous spatial, probabilistic, and entropic processing. Sparse heuristics naturally emerge as stable substructures in RSVP's entropic field gradients, offering a biologically plausible foundation for intelligent inference.
6. TARTAN: Entropic Tiling and Recursive Alignment
The
TARTAN framework
(Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise) generalizes RSVP into a modular architecture for recursive spatial computation. Using CRDT-like entropic smoothing, Wasserstein distance metrics, and recursive alignment via annotated perturbations, TARTAN simulates how distributed systems maintain coherence under local perturbations. Each tile computes locally while aligning with global flows, yielding a polycomputational substrate for memory, reasoning, and visual interpretation across scales.
7. Chain of Memory (CoM) Reasoning Framework
CoM
is an alternative to chain-of-thought prompting in AI systems, based on the idea that reasoning is not sequential but
layered over distributed memory states
. Built on RSVP and TARTAN, this framework allows AI models to access multiple past states in parallel, aligning them recursively to stabilize semantic drift and maintain coherent narratives. CoM models
reasoning as recursive coherence reconstruction
, making it both explainable and biologically grounded.
8. Derived Fiber Products and Entropy Tilings
This project applies
derived algebraic geometry
to RSVP systems. Fiber products, intersections of derived stacks, and singularity structures are used to model multi-source entropic computation. The resulting
entropy tilings
capture how thermodynamic histories intersect to form coherent spacetime patterns. Polycomputation here emerges from the structure of derived categories, where recursive gluing of local patches generates global meaning. These intersections represent
computational singularities
‚Äîsites where multiple causal layers converge.
9. RSVP Cosmology and Entropic Smoothing
RSVP's implications for cosmology include a radical departure from standard expansion models. Instead of an expanding spacetime,
RSVP cosmology
posits that structure emerges through
entropic smoothing
of scalar-vector discontinuities. Horizons are modeled not as limits of space, but as gradients of semantic and thermodynamic coherence. This project interprets cosmic evolution as a
distributed computation across entropy layers
, where universes form via recursive field relaxation‚Äîembedding meaning into spacetime geometry itself.
10. œÜ<sub>RSVP</sub>: A Metric for Consciousness
The culmination of this research program is the definition of
œÜ<sub>RSVP</sub>
, a proposed metric for conscious field states. This metric evaluates multidimensional coherence across RSVP fields using variational principles, information geometry, and entropy flow. Consciousness is modeled as the solution to a multilevel optimization problem: maintaining maximal coherence across scalar, vector, and entropy surfaces under recursive, distributed constraints. œÜ<sub>RSVP</sub> formalizes the idea that
consciousness is a polycomputational state
‚Äîa dense attractor in semantic-geometric space.
Conclusion: Polycomputation as a New Paradigm
Together, these ten projects articulate a
polycomputational worldview
, wherein computation is not bound to discrete steps, Turing tapes, or neural spikes, but distributed across recursive geometries, entropy fields, ethical grammars, and layered histories. RSVP theory provides the unifying substrate for this vision, integrating physics, consciousness, reasoning, and cosmology into a thermodynamically structured computational whole.
These projects can be developed independently or as a modular research program, with immediate applications in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, symbolic systems, ethical computation, and physical theory.
