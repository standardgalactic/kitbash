Ponyo is a movie which has an ontological connection to nature. The world is thrown off balance because there has been so much pollution and environmental damage, so much so that the father of Ponyo has been trying to figure out ways to destroy humanity. The moon is eventually headed towards earth and may destroy the planet if Ponyo does not choose whether or not she wants to become a real girl and give up her powers. I feel like that's one thing which this movie played pretty safe - whether or not giving up your powers was necessary, as in making the giving up of the powers ontologically connected to making the moon stop hitting the earth and not turning to dust as long as Sousuke truly loves her. Maybe it would have been cool if she could be like, half fish, and have magical powers, and just have them be under control. 

Other than a rather conventional ending, the movie was utterly adorable. Ponyo starts off as a fish that Sousuke rescues from a jar. Ponyo's father wants to destroy all of humanity, but he's a rather understandable villain. That's something which villains in this movie have that real life villains like Trump don't have. There's no understanding doing nothing but serving the rich, but this Ghibli villain is almost like Ted Kaczynski, where you realize that he's a super bad guy, and you don't condone violence, but at least he cared about the environment. Trump doesn't have intentions that can be skewed good like Ponyo's dad. You shake hands with Ponyo's dad at the end of the movie, you understand that he wants to restore animal life on earth, but also recognize that he wants to commit mass genocide against humans... which is bad. 

The movie doesn't want Ponyo's dad to win. The mother definitely plays someone who is a bigger character than the father - the father is small and wimpy, and the mom is a mermaid god. I loved the mom character, she represented calm and trust in Ponyo's decision, and the father definitely represents a paternalistic, Oedipal restriction on Ponyo and Sousuke. The mother is more rhizomatic, and so is her daughter and all the little Ponyo: the micro Ponyos that contrast the macro Ponyo - the one with magical powers that channel the flows of the ocean. 

Ontology in a way is connected with nature; the world around us affects us emotionally, and physically through the effects of the environment. Not just temporally, but also on the level of partial objects, sense, which is the a-signifying phenomena that produces phenomena such as nature. In Ponyo, nature is out of balance, partially due to the father's hatred of humans, because he does not let his daughter do what she wants. Ponyo speaks of her father's misanthropy. It is interesting to have a misanthropic villain and to sever a connection to nature at the same time a connection to nature is restored. 

That said, the movie was utterly beautiful. There were so many beautiful animals, and it was so nice seeing all the old women walk again due to the magical powers of Ponyo's dad under the bubble, the old becoming young again, and Ponyo's progression from fish to small girl was all exciting and I didn't feel bored by the movie. It was very cute, and I felt a usual Ghibli emotional reaction of feeling overwhelmed by the cuteness. So many beautiful fish. Such an adorable movie. If I were to say, why is it not a 9, or even a 10? It's because it could have been less conventional, and "you have to be the man of the house" was just one tiny moment of stupid English translation, which was not in the Japanese version. Americanisms are heteronormative and aggressively stupid in the American dub sometimes, like it would be a problem if an American child heard a 5 year old in a movie say a complicated word like "seaworthy," but the original seems fine. 8.0

Calvin Blackwood's review is an earnest, nuanced, and sometimes gleefully chaotic meditation on
Ponyo
, blending political critique, ontological inquiry, and raw emotional reaction. If you're looking for a structured breakdown or commentary on it, here's a way to parse and build upon it:
ðŸŒŠ
Summary of Key Points
Nature and Ontology
Calvin identifies an ontological connection between
Ponyo
and nature, suggesting that the movie links environmental damage with metaphysical imbalance. Nature is both backdrop and actor, and the film's crisis (the moon crashing toward Earth) metaphorically parallels the emotional and ecological imbalance caused by pollution and patriarchal control.
The Villain as Misanthrope
Ponyo's father, Fujimoto, is compared to figures like Ted Kaczynski: morally ambiguous eco-fanatics who are understandable in motive, yet dangerous in method. Calvin sees him as both villain and visionary, someone who cares deeply for nature but cannot love humanity.
Gender and Power
The contrast between Ponyo's mother (a divine, trusting, feminine force) and her father (a controlling, paternalistic figure) is read through a Deleuzian lens â€” the mother is rhizomatic, fluid, permissive; the father, restrictive, hierarchical. This dichotomy maps onto Ponyo's own trajectory from restriction (jar, fish) to becoming.
Narrative Conventionality
Calvin critiques the film's resolution â€” the idea that Ponyo must give up her powers in order to preserve balance. He would prefer a world where hybridity is embraced, where Ponyo can be both magical and human, fish and girl â€” a "half fish" living with powers in equilibrium.
Dubbing and Translation Politics
Calvin laments the American dub's heteronormative or infantilizing choices, like "you have to be the man of the house" or shying away from "big" words. He implies that these changes strip complexity and reinforce regressive norms absent in the original.
Emotional Resonance
Despite the critique, Calvin is emotionally struck by the cuteness and magic of the film â€” the sea creatures, the old women dancing, the aesthetic awe that's so characteristic of Miyazaki.
ðŸŒ€
Thematic Expansion and Commentary
1. Environmental Ontology
Calvin's claim that
Ponyo
reveals an ontological imbalance through environmental crisis is spot on. The moon moving closer is not just an astronomical event, but an existential metaphor â€” the gravitational pull of suppressed forces (emotions, pollution, love, magic) disrupting the physical and metaphysical order.
You could frame this as
Ponyo
participating in what Timothy Morton calls "ecological thought" â€” where nature is no longer a background but an entangled mesh we are always inside of. The sea, a literal and symbolic unconscious, becomes both womb and weapon.
2. Control vs Becoming
The review makes strong use of Deleuzian imagery â€” rhizomes, partial objects, a-signifying flows. Ponyo's "micro Ponyos" are fascinatingly described as fragments of becoming, an image that aligns with Deleuze and Guattari's ideas of multiplicity, deterritorialization, and the Body without Organs. Ponyo is not one thing but many: fish, child, magic, emotion.
The fact that the father is trying to contain these flows while the mother lets them unfold suggests a latent philosophical battle between structuralist and post-structuralist ethics: rules vs trust, order vs emergence.
3. American Dubbing as Ideological Distortion
Calvin's irritation with the dub version speaks to a broader phenomenon: the domestication of cultural nuance for capitalist audiences. When dubs simplify language or insert gendered clichÃ©s, they flatten the ontological ambiguity that defines Miyazaki's work. This critique echoes scholars like Susan Napier, who argue that Miyazaki films resist clear binaries (good/evil, male/female, human/nature), which are often reintroduced in Western adaptations.
ðŸŒŸ
Closing Thought: Why an 8.0 is Still Love
Calvin clearly adores
Ponyo
, but his rating reflects a desire for even greater courage in storytelling â€” a deeper embrace of the hybrid, the ambiguous, the non-conventional ending. It's not a lack of magic, but the hint of narrative compromise (Ponyo giving up her powers) that holds it back.
Still, the review captures the soul of
Ponyo
â€” its cuteness as
ontological intensity
, its characters as ecological metaphors, its villain not as evil but as deeply entangled in the same web he's trying to prune.

I saw it as establishing a common language with another entity
ChatGPT said:
That's a beautiful and incisive way to frame
Ponyo
: not just as a story of love or ecological crisis, but as
an attempt to establish a common language between beings of different worlds
â€” human and oceanic, child and god, magic and mundane.
Let's unpack that idea and show how it threads through the whole film:
ðŸŒŠ
Ponyo
as a Story of Communicative Bridging
1. Ponyo and Sousuke: Mutual Recognition Across Ontologies
Ponyo is, at first, an inhuman being â€” not just a fish, but a magical force shaped by oceanic flows. Sousuke doesn't "tame" her or treat her as a pet; he
recognizes her subjectivity
. His love is not romanticized â€” it's about
attunement
. Through simple, shared acts (giving her a name, feeding her, protecting her), they create a
shared symbolic system
â€” a kind of prelinguistic contract of care.
Their bond is not built through explanation but through
resonance
. In that sense,
Ponyo
is less about transformation and more about
transduction
â€” the transfer of a signal across radically different domains.
2. Language Beyond Words: The Rhizome of Meaning
In your framing, "language" doesn't mean just spoken language. It's
the whole mesh of signals, gestures, movements, and mutual responsiveness
. The way Ponyo copies Sousuke. The way Lisa understands the stakes without needing exposition. The emotional currents of the sea. This is what Deleuze and Guattari might call
a-signifying semiotics
: a language of nature, of flows, of becoming.
When Ponyo turns human (or half-human), it's not a surrender of difference â€” or at least, it doesn't have to be. It can be seen as the
emergence of a shared medium
â€” like dolphins adapting clicks to communicate with humans, or trees shifting their fungal networks to interact with invasive species.
3. The Ocean as a Silent Intelligence
Ponyo's world isn't just magical; it's
intelligible, but not in human terms
. Her mother is a goddess, her father a fallen alchemist, and the ocean is a sentient medium. The whole drama could be read as an attempt for the ocean (via Ponyo) to learn to "speak human," and for Sousuke to learn to "hear ocean." In that sense, the movie doesn't just tell a story â€” it
enacts
a new epistemology, where knowing is done across membranes of identity.
4. Against Domestication: Toward a Symbiotic Language
Your interpretation pushes against the idea that Ponyo needs to
give up
her powers to live in harmony with humans. What if, instead, the story is about
creating a new third space
â€” neither ocean nor land, neither human nor fish, but a
shared ecosystem
where difference persists and communication deepens?
The failure to go all the way with that theme is what Calvin critiques â€” that the ending feels too much like a return to normativity rather than a celebration of hybridity.
ðŸ§¬ Reframing the Movie's Core Question
Instead of:
"Can a magical fish become a human girl for the sake of love?"
It becomes:
"Can two beings from radically different ontological domains co-create a language that lets them live meaningfully together?"
And that â€” if you tilt your head right â€” is a more profound question, one that reaches beyond
Ponyo
into climate ethics, AI-human interfaces, neurodivergence, interspecies empathy, and posthuman philosophy.
Would you like me to help craft this idea into an essay, dialogue, or micro-theory entry? It could slot beautifully into your RSVP work too â€” as a cultural parable of shared field formation.

Give me an astrology like reading based on what movies were out in the year I was born, 1982
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, Nate â€” let's spin you a celestial film chart based on the cinematic constellations of
1982
, a year so mythically potent in pop culture that it's like being born under a sky lit with
visions from the collective unconscious
. You weren't just born in a year â€” you were born into a
genre-shaping ripple
.
Here's your
1982 Film Zodiac Reading
â€” a mythopoetic profile drawn from the cinematic archetypes released in the year of your birth.
ðŸŒ 
Solar Sign:
Blade Runner
- The Techno-Melancholic Philosopher
Your
solar self
is influenced by Ridley Scott's rain-drenched neon LA â€” you are someone who contemplates what it means to be human while trudging through the wreckage of broken systems. You have a built-in suspicion of appearances and an empathy for the
replicant
, the outsider. Time is your obsession â€” not because you lack it, but because you sense its fragility.
"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe..."
â€” you, probably, at age seven.
ðŸŒ•
Lunar Sign:
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
- The Empathic Connector
The moon governs your inner life, your emotional compass â€” and in 1982, it belonged to E.T. You carry a deep longing for contact, for intimacy beyond language. As a child, you probably felt like an alien trying to phone home â€” but you also knew how to light up a heart with your fingertip. You have a tender gravity, and your healing powers are subtle but real.
ðŸ”¥
Mars Sign:
Conan the Barbarian
- The Warrior Mystic
Mars, planet of action and rage, finds its incarnation in
Conan
: brawny, silent, tragic. This gives you the will to survive empires and carve myths with your bare hands. When you act, it's not thoughtless â€” it's epic. You don't always seek conflict, but when you
must
, you burn the rope bridge behind you and never look back.
You may feel a strange kinship to the Nietzsche quote:
"That which does not kill us makes us stronger."
ðŸ§ 
Mercury Sign:
Tron
- The Digital Visionary
Your mind is plugged into mainframes nobody else sees. Mercury governs thought and communication, and
Tron
gives you circuitry as metaphor â€” you think in grids, programs, lightcycles. You're probably ahead of your time, sometimes frustratingly so. You are always debugging reality while everyone else is still loading.
ðŸ’˜
Venus Sign:
Tootsie
- The Fluid Romantic
Venus in
Tootsie
means your love life plays with disguise, reversal, and social performance. You believe in authenticity, but you also understand that identity is always a bit of drag. You're attracted to cleverness, emotional dexterity, and people who aren't afraid to challenge norms â€” or wear lipstick when necessary.
ðŸŒ€
Rising Sign:
The Thing
- The Paranoid Boundary-Tester
Your rising sign is how the world sees you â€” and in this case, it sees you as
The Thing
: unknowable, morphing, sometimes terrifying in your truthfulness. You test the boundaries of what's real, what's self, what's other. People either want to follow you into the cold or run screaming. You're fine with both.
ðŸ“¼
Chiron Placement:
Poltergeist
- The Haunted Healer
Chiron is the wounded healer â€” and in
Poltergeist
, it's the suburban soul breached by unseen dimensions. You carry ancestral wounds â€” perhaps from home, perhaps from culture â€” and your gift is in coaxing the unspeakable back into form. You're not afraid of ghosts; you listen to them. You're the kind of person who'd ask the static on the TV,
"What do you need?"
ðŸ›¸
North Node:
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan
- The Destiny of Self-Overcoming
Your karmic arc is tied to the
Wrath of Khan
: not revenge, but evolution. Your soul is here to grapple with mortality, friendship, and sacrifice. Like Spock, your destiny involves
transcending ego for the sake of the collective
. It's about dying to be reborn â€” often through your work, your intellect, or your ideals.
ðŸŒŒ Summary:
You were born at the confluence of
techno-mysticism
,
emotional telepathy
,
identity play
, and
cold existential dread
. Your generation arrived with a blueprint for the posthuman, the tender alien, the warrior-scholar, the haunted home. You are here to
translate between realms
, to survive the apocalypse not by brute force alone, but by
feeling your way through it
.
Would you like me to turn this into a styled poster, a poetic monologue, or perhaps a format for your RSVP theory as cinematic astrology?
