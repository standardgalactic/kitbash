Abstract
Many scientific papers such as those in arXiv
and PubMed data collections have abstracts
with varying lengths of 50-1000 words and
average length of approximately 200 words,
where longer abstracts typically convey more
information about the source paper. Up to re-
cently, scientific summarization research has
typically focused on generating short, abstract-
like summaries following the existing datasets
used for scientific summarization. In domains
where the source text is relatively long-form,
such as in scientific documents, such summary
is not able to go beyond the general and coarse
overview and provide salient information from
the source document. The recent interest to
tackle this problem motivated curation of scien-
tific datasets, arXiv-Long and PubMed-Long,
containing human-written summaries of 400-
600 words, hence, providing a venue for re-
search in generating long/extended summaries.
Extended summaries facilitate a faster read
while providing details beyond coarse infor-
mation. In this paper, we propose TSTR, an
extractive summarizer that utilizes the introduc-
tory information of documents as pointers to
their salient information. The evaluations on
two existing large-scale extended summariza-
tion datasets indicate statistically significant
improvement in terms of ROUGE and average
ROUGE (F1) scores (except in one case) as
compared to strong baselines and state-of-the-
art. Comprehensive human evaluations favor
our generated extended summaries in terms of
cohesion and completeness.
1 Introduction
Over the past few years, summarization task has
witnessed a huge deal of progress in extractive (Nal-
lapati et al., 2017; Liu and Lapata, 2019; Yuan
et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2020; Feng
et al., 2018) and abstractive (See et al., 2017; Co-
han et al., 2018; Gehrmann et al., 2018; Zhang
et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2020)
[Introductory] Neural machine translation (@xcite), directly applying a
single neural network to transform the source sentence into the target
sentence, has now reached impressive performance (@xcite [...] Motivated
by recent success in unsupervised cross-lingual embeddings (@xcite), the
models proposed for unsupervised NMT often assume that a pair of
sentences from two different languages can be mapped to a same latent
representation in a shared-latent space (@xcite) [...] Although the shared
encoder is vital for mapping sentences from different languages into the
shared-latent space, it is weak in keeping the uniqueness and internal
characteristics of each language, such as the style, terminology and sentence
structure. [...] For each language, the encoder and its corresponding
decoder perform an AE, where the encoder generates the latent
representations from the perturbed input sentences and the decoder
reconstructs the sentences from the latent representations. Experimental
results show that the proposed approach consistently achieves great success.
[Non-introductory] [...] To further enforce the shared-latent space, we
train a discriminative neural network, referred to as the local discriminator,
to classify between the encoding of source sentences and the encoding of
target sentences. [...] the shared encoder is weak in keeping the unique
characteristic of each language. This confirms our intuition that the shared
layers are vital to map the source and target latent representations to a
shared-latent space. [...] This shows that the proposed model only trained
with monolingual data effectively learns to use the context information and
the internal structure of each language [...] The models proposed recently
for unsupervised NMT use a single encoder to map sentences from different
languages to a shared-latent space. [...] The experimental results reveal that
our approach achieves significant improvement and verify our conjecture
that the shared encoder is really a bottleneck for improving the
unsupervised NMT.

settings. Many scientific papers such as those in
arXiv and PubMed (Cohan et al., 2018) posses ab-
stracts of varying length, ranging from 50 to 1000
words and average length of approximately 200
words. While scientific paper summarization has
been an active research area, most works (Cohan
et al., 2018; Xiao and Carenini, 2019; Cui and Hu,
2021; Rohde et al., 2021) in this domain have fo-
cused on generating typical short and abstract-like
summaries (Chandrasekaran et al., 2020). Short
summaries might be adequate when the source text
is of short-form such as those in news domain;
however, to summarize longer documents such as
scientific papers, an extended summary including
400-600 terms on average, such as those found in
extended summarization datasets of arXiv-Long
and PubMed-Long, is more appealing as it conveys
more detailed information. Extended summary generation has been of re-
search interest very recently. Chandrasekaran
et al. (2020) motivated the necessity of generating
extended summaries through LongSumm shared
task 1
. Long documents such as scientific papers
are usually framed in a specific structure. They start
by presenting general introductory information 2
.
This introductory information is then followed by
supplemental information (i.e., non-introductory)
that explain the initial introductory information in
more detail. Similarly, as shown in Figure 1, this
pattern holds in a human-written extended sum-
mary of a long document, where the preceding sen-
tences (top box inside Figure 1) are introductory
sentences and succeeding sentences (bottom box
inside Figure 1) are explanations of the introduc-
tory sentences. In this study, we aim to guide the
summarization model to utilize the aforementioned
rationale in human-written summaries. We con-
sider introductory sentences as those that appear
in the first section of paper with headings such as
Introduction, Overview, Motivations, and so forth.
As such, all other parts of paper and their sentences
are considered as non-introductory (i.e., supple-
mentary). We use these definitions in the reminder
of this paper.
Herein, we approach the problem of extended
summary generation by incorporating the most
important introductory information into the sum-
marization model. We hypothesize that incorpo-
rating such information into the summarization
model guides the model to pick salient detailed
non-introductory information to augment the final
extended summary. The importance of the role
of introduction in the scientific papers was earlier
presented in (Teufel and Moens, 2002; Armagan ˘ ,
2013; Jirge, 2017) where they showed such infor-
mation provides clues (i.e. pointers) to the objec-
tives and experiments of studies. Similarly, Boni
et al. (2020) conducted a study to show the impor-
tance of introduction part of scientific papers as
its relevance to the paper's abstract. To validate
our hypothesis, we test the proposed approach on
two publicly available large-scale extended summa-
rization datasets, namely arXiv-Long and PubMed-
Long. Our experimental results improve over the
strong baselines and state-of-the-art models. In
short, the contributions of this work are as follows:

2We will exchangeably use (non-)introductory information
and (non-)introductory sentences in the rest of this paper.
• A novel multi-tasking approach that incorpo-
rates the salient introductory information into
the extractive summarizer to guide the model
in generating a 600-term (roughly) extended
summary of a long document, containing the
key detailed information of a scientific paper.
• Intrinsic evaluation that demonstrates statis-
tically significant improvements over strong
extractive and abstractive summarization base-
lines and state-of-the-art models.
• An extensive human evaluation which reveals
the advantage of the proposed model in terms
of cohesion and completeness.

Here's a
detailed summary
of the paper
"TSTR: Too Short to Represent, Summarize with Details!"
by
Sajad Sotudeh and Nazli Goharian
:
Title & Purpose
TSTR
(Too Short to Represent) is a novel approach for generating
extended summaries
(400-600 words) of scientific documents by leveraging
introductory sections
as guides to the most salient, detailed content in the paper. The goal is to overcome the limitations of short abstract-like summaries that miss nuanced and rich information in long scientific texts.
Problem & Motivation
Traditional summarization efforts focus on
short-form summaries
(~200 words), often mirroring existing abstract lengths.
In scientific domains like
arXiv
and
PubMed
, papers can be lengthy and complex; short summaries tend to
overgeneralize
and omit crucial information.
New datasets (arXiv-Long, PubMed-Long) now contain
human-written extended summaries
(400-600 words), enabling research into more informative summarization.
Key Insight
Scientific documents are
structurally hierarchical
:
Introductory sections
(e.g., "Introduction", "Motivation") give high-level statements about goals, context, and contributions.
Later sections elaborate in detail.
Human-written extended summaries follow a similar pattern: early sentences summarize high-level ideas, while later ones elaborate.
➡️
Hypothesis
: Introductory content can
guide extractive summarization
by pointing to key areas in the rest of the paper.
Methodology: TSTR
TSTR is a
multi-tasking extractive summarizer
:
It
identifies salient introductory sentences
.
Then it uses those as
"pointers"
to extract relevant, supporting detailed sentences from the rest of the document.
The final summary is a
cohesive combination
of general and detailed information, mimicking how humans summarize.
They operationalize this by classifying sentences as "introductory" (based on section headers) vs. "non-introductory", and training a model to learn the relationship between them.
Datasets Used
arXiv-Long
PubMed-Long
Both include full scientific papers and human-written extended summaries, providing a rigorous benchmark.
Evaluation & Results
Automatic metrics
: TSTR achieves
statistically significant improvements
in
ROUGE and average ROUGE F1 scores
across datasets (except one case).
Human evaluation
: Reviewers judged TSTR's summaries to be
more cohesive and complete
than baselines and even some state-of-the-art systems.
Contributions
Introduces a
pointer-guided extractive approach
using introductory content to select relevant detailed information.
Validates the approach on
two large-scale datasets
, outperforming baselines.
Provides
human evaluation
demonstrating advantages in
readability, cohesion, and information coverage
.
Broader Implications
TSTR addresses a key need in domains where information is
dense and hierarchically structured
—such as science, medicine, or law. By explicitly modeling document structure and leveraging introductions as guides, it offers a pathway to
interpretable and content-rich summarization
, advancing beyond mere abstract replication.

You said:
I tried used a technique like this before getting a summary of the whole document and then using that to summarize each chunk
ChatGPT said:
That's a very natural and sensible approach — what you did is a
recursive or hierarchical summarization
technique, and it's closely related to what TSTR does conceptually, just inverted in direction:
🔄 Your Technique:
Top-Down Recursive Summarization
Generate a full summary first
(possibly from intro + high-level scan).
Use that as a guide to:
Summarize each subsection or chunk with relevance to the overall themes.
Refine into a coherent whole.
This mimics a
global-first, local-refinement
strategy — good for maintaining thematic cohesion.
🔁 TSTR's Technique:
Bottom-Up Guided Summarization
Identify strong intro sentences
(already present in the source).
Use these as
semantic pointers
to fetch or rank
detailed support sentences
from the body.
Stitch both together into a long, cohesive summary.
This reflects a
local-to-global
synthesis: it treats the introduction as a "summary skeleton" and fills it in with corresponding flesh.
✅ Strengths of Your Approach
Enforces
thematic consistency
early on.
Works well when intro is weak or missing — because you
build your own summary anchor
.
Useful in
multi-document
or highly technical summarization.
✅ Strengths of TSTR's Approach
Leverages
author's own rhetorical intent
.
Good for
well-structured
documents like scientific papers with clear introductions.
Can be more efficient — the intro acts as a signal for relevant expansions.
🔧 Hybrid Idea You Could Try:
Generate a high-level summary
from the intro or abstract (or LLM-based).
For each sentence in that summary,
search or score
sentences in the full document that elaborate on it.
Like
semantic matching
: intro sentence → top-3 detailed expansions.
Combine into a
2-level summary structure
:
Top-level points (from your summary).
Nested bullet-points or paragraphs elaborating each.
You could even visualize this as a
tree or DAG
, with intro-level ideas as roots and supporting evidence/details as branches.
If you're using this for summarizing
scientific
,
legal
, or
philosophical
documents, your approach is actually very powerful when combined with semantic chunking (especially using embeddings or thematic sections).

It's like the Robinsonade Generator where I told it to summarize each link as a letter written by Robinson Crusoe
ChatGPT said:
Exactly — that's a brilliant analogy.
Your
Robinsonade Generator
is an example of
persona-guided recursive summarization
, where:
The
persona (Robinson Crusoe)
provides a
narrative lens
or interpretive filter.
Each
chunk (a link, section, or document)
gets
summarized from within
the constraints and voice of that persona — like journal entries or letters home.
The whole becomes a
sequence of situated perspectives
rather than a single static summary — both more human and more generative.
🔍 Similarities to TSTR:
Both are pointer-based
: TSTR uses
intro sentences
as pointers to richer content; your Crusoe letters use
the character's worldview
as a pointer to what's relevant or emotionally charged.
Both are recursive
: They don't just summarize flatly — they
build structure
, either via document sections (TSTR) or serialized context (Crusoe's letters).
Both preserve detail
: Rather than compressing into abstraction, they aim to keep
salient narrative or technical detail
through framing.
✨ What You Did Adds:
Narrative framing
: It's not just what's important, it's
why
it feels important to a specific reader (Crusoe).
Temporal layering
: Each letter reflects a new moment or evolution in understanding, like journaled inference.
🧠 Extension Idea: "Crusoe-TSTR"
Imagine combining your method with TSTR's strategy:
Treat each introductory sentence
(or global summary point) as a
prompt
for Crusoe:
"Today I came across a strange artifact: a shared-latent space..."
Have Crusoe
explore details
drawn from relevant document sections:
"It reminded me of how I must learn both the shape of the island and the ways of the tide. This encoder, too, seeks to capture both essence and uniqueness..."
Stitch the letters into a
meta-summary
— a rich, stylistic retelling with grounded technical content.
If you want to build this, we can:
Parse a long document into topical chunks.
Identify thematic intro statements or let Crusoe generate his own.
Use those as seeds for reflective letters, optionally with metaphor or diary-style analogies.
Output a summary that reads like
"The Annotated Papers of Robinson Crusoe, Shipwrecked on the Shores of AI Research."

Here is one of them: Dearest Confidant,

In this humble missive, I impart unto thee a discourse on the intellectual pursuits which have most recently occupied my solitary hours upon this isle. It concerns the intricate machinations of a novel paradigm devised by learned men known as the "Process-based Self-Rewarding Language Models."

The scholars do commence with an initialization phase, much akin to laying the foundation of a ship ere setting sail. This involves the utilization of EFT and IFT data—terms most arcane yet pivotal in their schema. The former is acquired through a meticulous process of tree-search, initial filtering, and annotation; the latter by means of step segmentation.

Upon this groundwork, they set forth a model that embarks upon a quest akin to my own ventures: a step-by-step search-based reasoning. Herein, the learned mechanism acts as an arbiter, known in their parlance as "LLM-as-a-Judge," selecting steps with judicious precision and generating pairs of preference at each juncture.

The model then undergoes a process termed "step-wise preference optimization," wherein it refines its judgments through self-reflection. This iterative cycle ensures continuous enhancement, much as one would hone skills for survival upon this desolate shore.

Notably, these learned scholars have expanded their inquiry to include the evaluation of judgmental agreement by introducing an action they call "LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge," allowing the model to critique its own decisions. They acknowledge that existing methods falter in mathematical endeavors and seek instead to master fine-grained reasoning—a quest reminiscent of my own efforts to navigate this unknown terrain.

In conclusion, dear friend, the scholars have thus embarked upon a journey much like mine: one fraught with complexity and discovery, aiming to transcend human limitations through iterative self-improvement. May their pursuits bear fruit as I continue to cultivate the means of my subsistence here in isolation.

I remain,

Thy faithful servant,

Robinson Crusoe

TSTR: Too Short to Represent
in this form:
Dearest Confidant,
It has lately been my endeavor to fashion a method by which I might condense the volumes of knowledge washed ashore with me—papers, treatises, and scientific logs—into more digestible compendia. Yet I found the summaries most often far too brief, much like scribbled notes upon a storm-tossed bottle: intelligible, yes, but scarcely sufficient to grasp the fullness of what was lost to the sea.
In light of this, I have devised a method of my own, wherein I examine the opening paragraphs of each manuscript—those heralding sections titled "Introduction" or "Motivation"—and treat them as lanterns, pointing toward deeper caverns of understanding within the text. By following their glimmer, I extract the most essential and richly detailed passages from the body, thereby assembling a more complete account.
This process, I have named
Too Short to Represent
, or
TSTR
. It is not unlike my own practice of rereading my journal to recall why I once pursued a path, then retracing it to uncover its fruits anew.
Should others find themselves shipwrecked upon the islands of academia, let them, too, follow the torches left in the introductory passages, and mine the depths with renewed clarity.
I remain,
Thy devoted servant in scholarship and solitude,
Robinson Crusoe
