View Answer Report Error Comment  
Answer & Explanation 
 
Answer: Option B 
 
Explanation : 
Suppose you enter a command like cp x y. Unlike the user, who uses the name to identify 
and differentiate files, the system uses i-node number to uniquely identify a file. Any file 
name has an associated i-node number. In UNIX. different files can have the same name. But 
the associated i-nodc number will be different. The filename---i-node correspondence can be 
found in the directory which has to be the first one that is to be searched, as nothing can be 
done to a file without knowing its i-node number.

A.

C.  
All the three 
D.  
None of the above 
  
View Answer Report Error Comment  
Answer & Explanation 
 
Answer: Option B 
 
Explanation : 
Directory entries have two fields. One for the file name and the other for the i-node number. 
The i-node has many fields for storing all the information about the file, except the file name 

and the actual content of the tile. The content of the file will be in a separate place. So. the 
details of any file will be spread over these three places. When a file is updated its name and 
i-node number will remain the same. Only the contents and some fields in the i-node (like 
file size, time of last access, etc.) need to be changed. Hence the answer

Explanation : 
For regular (ordinary) files the first character (i.e. b here), will be just a underscore. For 
directories d. for character special files ' ' and ' b' for a block read special file. The last 
column will have lp for line printer. hp for disk drives. tty for terminals etc. The 3 in 3 ,

View Answer Report Error Comment  
Answer & Explanation 
 
Answer: Option D 
 
Explanation : 
First, the i-node number corresponding to idevi tty (i.e. the terminal currently used) is 
procured. Then the i-node is accessed. From it, the system understands, it is a character 
special file. So, whatever you type, if followed by ' n ' will he echoed in the terminal. Typing 
control d, also lushes the buffer contents to t ty. But unlike 'control d is not transmitted. So. if 
you type ab ( Ad) cd ( Ad) first ab will be immediately transmitted, then cd will be 
transmitted. Whenever you press control d. then what you have typed between the previous 
control d (or from the start of the current line) to the current control d will be transmitted. So. 
if you type two control d consecutively or a single control d. at the beginning of a line then 
you are telling it to transmit. but nothing is there to be transmitted. So. the command gets 
terminated.

a C program that 
can be written

C.  
It produces a C' code that executes slower than a C program 
that can be%%ritten separately to accomplish the same task 
D.  All of these 
  
View Answer Report Error Comment  
Answer & Explanation 
 
Answer: Option D 
 
Explanation : 
The purpose of lex is to generate a 'C' function yylex, that will recognize any pattern that is 
given as input to lex, as a regular expression. Also, it can perform the specified action (like 
deleting, printing, changing to some other pattern, enciphering, etc.) when the specified 
pattern is matched. It does this by converting regular expression into a non deterministic 
finite state automata- then a finite state automata—then reduces the number of states in it. 
lex is a program generator, which means we can write our own code, which functions the 
same as the lex output. Since lex applies a general set of rules to achieve this, what it 

generates will not make efficient use of memory and is slower too. Yet it is a powerful 
tool.that simplifies the programmer's job.

All the library i /o functions (like getchar, scanf , gets etc.) use the same interme-diate buffer 
and share the same file pointer. So, they can be interleaved in any order to access 
consecutive characters in a tile without causing any inconsistency. Unlike them. system calls 
(like read and write) directly manipulate the tile. So, mixing system calls and library function
