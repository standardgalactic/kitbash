Project Interrelation Summary
Title:
Interrelations of Speculative Cognitive, Technological, and Ecological Systems in the Unified Framework
Abstract:
This document provides a structured academic summary of interconnected speculative projects developed. These projects span cognitive architectures, symbolic computation, terraforming infrastructures, embodied installations, and post-capitalist governance systems. All projects are interwoven through a shared ontological and semiotic substrate informed by theories such as Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH), Aspect Relegation Theory (ART), and the Inforganic Codex. The purpose of this summary is to clarify the theoretical lineage, practical instantiations, and systemic dependencies of the projects, as well as to frame their cumulative vision: the simulation and synthesis of a recursive civilization-scale cognition ecology.
1. Speculative Computation & Symbolic Devices
Everlasting Self-Knitting Yarnball
: A CRDT-based hypergraph simulator modeling cognitive rewinding through bidirectional graph rewriting. Interrelates with ART by demonstrating recursive relegation and with SITH by enacting temporal care loops.
Keyhole Message Transmission Device
: A semantic compressor for symbolic payloads using λ-calculus and Huffman encoding. Works as the transmission module for Semantic Metabolism and mirrors the loop-gated architecture of the Reflex Arc.
Pattern Generalizer Neuron
: Implements hierarchical clustering via prosodic and quaternion fields. Serves as a modular component in the Inforganic Wildtype and Trodden Path Mind architectures.
2. Terraforming Systems & Mytho-Tech Infrastructure
Cyclex Architecture (incl. Volsorial Pediments, Gravitational Batteries)
: A geoengineering framework deploying mobile oceanic units for climate regulation, integrating kelp-based carbon drawdown with deep-sea gravitational energy storage. These interact with SITH via eco-empathy logic and local semantic regulation.

Vertical Rainforest Trellises
: A structural-ecological synthesis bridging biological productivity with symbolic value encoding (e.g. care biomass).
3. Cognitive and Semiotic Frameworks
Inforganic Codex
: An evolving document defining cognition as an ecological, symbolically-regulated, relegation-based process. Centralized around the interaction between Organic Learning, Infomorphic Neural Networks, and ART.
Semantic Metabolism
: Models semantic flow as metabolic recombination rather than extraction. Forms the processing layer beneath the Keyhole Device and Recursive Cloakproof Chain Generator.
Aspect Relegation Theory (ART)
: The control mechanism for shifting cognitive labor between reflective and automatic processes. Directly underlies the operation of the Reflex Arc Logistics Manager.
4. Artistic & Embodied Installations
Womb Body Bioforge
: A probiotic fabrication device using yogurt as both symbol and substrate. Symbolically tied to the Keyhole Device and Motile Womb Theory.

and
Emotion-Sorted Organizer
: Translate emotional and cognitive states into physical artifacts and acoustic modulation. Connected to Lexical Compression Rituals and the Swarm Syntax System.

: A post-capitalist allocation system based on care entropy and symbolic labor. Implements ART and SITH as guiding moral-logistical frameworks.
GAIACRAFT
: A civilization-scale divergence engine using the Stars! ergodic scouting model, simulating eco-memetic evolution. Sits atop the Reflex Arc as a planetary cognitive orchestration protocol.
Fractal Labor Encoding & Postcapitalist Room-Build Protocols
: Experimental contracts and symbolic housing simulations developed in Unreal/JSON-LD to validate equitable resource flows.
6. Language, Ritual & Narrative Systems
Recursive Cloakproof Chain Generator
: A poetic/cryptographic tool that mirrors symbolic succession and version control. Interfaces with ABRAXAS and the Standard Galactic Alphabet Decoding Project.
Paper Straw Ion Channel Tool
: A neuro-semiotic teaching model linked metaphorically to prenatal cognition and the Motile Womb.

Conclusion:
All projects described above are components of a recursive, care-driven intelligence architecture that operates across symbolic, ecological, and social layers. Whether deployed as installations, theoretical models, governance experiments, or simulations, each project functions as both tool and metaphor. Together, they instantiate a living ecosystem of cognitive infrastructure—a Yarnball Earth model for posthuman planetary coordination.
