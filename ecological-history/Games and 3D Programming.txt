Everything you know about my games Holidays and Spellpop and my 3d programming language Spherepop.
ChatGPT dijo:
Here is a summary of what I currently know based on our conversations:
ðŸŽ® Games
1.
Holidays
Status
: Mentioned but not yet detailed.
Known Information
:
The game "Holidays" has been referenced by name only.
No specific genre, mechanics, lore, or platform details have been provided.
Possibly fits within your broader creative ecosystem (which includes mythopoetic, symbolic, or simulation-based works), but the context is still unclear.
Clarification Needed
:
Is it narrative-driven, educational, simulative, satirical?
Single-player or multiplayer? Procedural, turn-based, sandbox, etc.?
2.
Spellpop
Status
: Mentioned by name.
Known Information
:
Appears to be a game, possibly language- or logic-based, given your interest in symbolic systems.
Could be related to your projects on phonology, spell systems, or semiotic structures.
Speculative Fit
:
May relate to your interest in alternate writing systems (e.g., Standard Galactic Alphabet, Arabic phonetic keyboards).
Could involve magic-as-programming, semiotic puzzles, or a symbolic AI interface (aligned with
Semantic Ladle Theory
or
Inforganic Codex
ideas).
Clarification Needed
:
What's the core gameplay? Are spells composed via real grammar, or visual glyphs?
Is it educational, ludic, or part of a larger narrative universe?
ðŸ§© 3D Programming Language
3.
Spherepop
Status
: Concept or prototype programming language.
Known Information
:
"Spherepop" is your custom 3D programming language.
The name suggests:
A metaphorical or literal use of
spheres
(objects, scopes, or data encapsulations).
Possibly
pop-based semantics
, such as stack-based popping or state-based behavior toggling.
Speculative Interpretation
:
Could be inspired by visual/spatial languages (like
Processing
,
TouchDesigner
, or
SDF
-based environments).
Might integrate with your aesthetic/futuristic UI ideas like
Flux Sphere Accord
,
Codex Singularis
, or
Semantic Intertextuality Map
.
Possibly reflects recursive, modular design â€” fitting with your cognitive frameworks (Inforganic, ART, SITH).
Potential Features (hypothetical)
:
3D spatial syntax
: Code written in 3D space or using 3D forms to represent logic/flow.
Visual node graphs or physical metaphors
(e.g. "popping" spheres = deleting/transforming scopes).
May involve
gesture-based
,
VR
, or
semiotic interfaces
for interacting with the code.

Sorry I misspelled Haplopraxis as holiday
ChatGPT dijo:
Memoria guardada actualizada
Thanks for the correctionâ€”got it. Here's the revised understanding of your projects:
ðŸŽ® Games
1.
Haplopraxis
(formerly miswritten as "Holidays")
Status
: Conceptual - mentioned as a named project.
Speculative Fit
:
Based on the name, it likely combines
"haplo-"
(single/simple) with
"praxis"
(practice or application).
Suggests a minimalist or foundational gameplay structureâ€”perhaps emphasizing elemental mechanics, procedural learning, or habit-formation.
Could be tied to cognitive or symbolic training, aligned with frameworks like
Inforganic Codex
or
Trodden Path Mind
.
Possible Themes
:
Procedural ethics, minimal cognitive control systems, or ritualized interaction patterns.
May serve as a tutorial-world, symbolic primer, or mental training simulation for other games or frameworks.
2.
Spellpop
Status
: Game, likely language- or spell-based.
Hypotheses
:
Likely involves
generative spell construction
, symbolic composition, or rhythm/phoneme interaction.
Could connect to your Arabic phonetic keyboard, Standard Galactic Alphabet work, or semiotic engines.
ðŸ§© Programming Language
3.
Spherepop
Status
: 3D programming language.
Conceptual Notes
:
May use spheres as modular objects or units of computation.
Likely inspired by recursive structures, gestural UI, or visual logic (e.g., pop-based transitions or scope management).
Could integrate into symbolic or artistic design environments.
Would you like me to attempt a speculative breakdown of Haplopraxis mechanics, or draft possible Spherepop syntax conventions?
