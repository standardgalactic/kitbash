O Worm, thou art Sick

After  ð’€­u (The Sky) created the Adornment, the Adornment created the Depths, the Depths created the Rivers, the Rivers created the Canals, the Canals created the Mud, and the Mud created the Worm,

the Worm went crying before the Sun, its tears flowed before the House of Water:

"What have you given for me to eat?
What have you given for me to suck?"

"I have given you the ripe fig and the apricot"

"What good is that to me, the ripe fig and the apricot?

Place me and let me dwell between tooth and gum, so I can suck the tooth's blood and devour the gum!"

Drive in the peg and seize the foot while saying:

"Because you said this, O Worm, may the House of Water strike you with their mighty hand!"
This text appears to be a modern poetic or mythological adaptation inspired by ancient Mesopotamian literature, particularly resembling incantations or mythological narratives found in Sumerian and Akkadian texts. The structure echoes creation myths (like
Enuma Elish
or the
Eridu Genesis
) where deities or elements beget one another in a genealogical sequence. The Worm's plea and the subsequent curse also recall Mesopotamian incantation texts, such as those used against toothworms (a common motif in Babylonian medicine).
Key Elements:
Cosmogony
- The chain of creation (Sky â†’ Adornment â†’ Depths â†’ Rivers â†’ Canals â†’ Mud â†’ Worm) mirrors Mesopotamian theogonies where primal forces generate successive layers of reality.
The Worm's Complaint
- The Worm's demand to dwell "between tooth and gum" parallels the
Babylonian Toothworm Spell
(e.g.,
Utukku Lemnutu
incantations), where a worm is blamed for toothache and is cursed or banished.
Ritualistic Curse
- The final lines resemble a healer's or exorcist's formula, invoking divine punishment (the "House of Water" may reference Ea/Enki's domain, the god of wisdom and fresh water).
Possible Interpretation:
The poem reimagines an ancient etiology of pain (here, tooth decay) as a mythological struggle. The Worm, born from primordial mud, rebels against its assigned sustenance (fruit) and demands to feed on human flesh insteadâ€”a metaphor for disease. The response is a ritualistic expulsion, akin to medical incantations that combined myth and practical healing.
If this is a contemporary piece, it brilliantly evokes the style of Mesopotamian literature while exploring themes of creation, rebellion, and suffering. If it's an actual translation, it might be a reconstruction of a fragmentary text. Would you like help tracking down specific sources or parallels?
