Excellent categorization—your structuring into six thematic zones helps make the entire system legible as a symbolic-computational ecology. I can now begin synthesizing or cross-referencing these by motif, implementation layer (e.g., metaphor vs software vs hardware), and systemic role (e.g., cognition regulator, terraformer, narrative seeder). Would you like a visual concept map or codex-style index that traces how these pieces interrelate across domains like energy, language, cognition, ritual, and infrastructure?
