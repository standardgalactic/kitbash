<p>Title: A Participatory Universe in the Realist Mode: On the
Separation of Observational and Agentive Perspectives in Classical and
Quantum Mechanics</p>
<p>Author: Jenann Ismael</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper explores the concept of interference, both in classical
and quantum mechanics, to understand the differences between these two
frameworks. The author introduces “Interference” as a phenomenon that
arises when a system’s representation of its domain is connected to its
own actions or knowledge-gathering activities. This connection makes it
impossible to stabilize certain features of the world independently of
the act of assigning them probabilities.</p>
<p>In classical physics, interference can be channeled and focused into
the future. However, in quantum mechanics, interference is endemic due
to the nature of quantum interactions (measurements). The author argues
that this distinction highlights the sense in which the universe is
participatory.</p>
<p>Ismael critiques the traditional epistemic attitude towards the
world, suggesting that it’s only possible in settings where our actions
don’t significantly affect what we’re trying to represent or learn
about. In a quantum setting, the act of measurement disturbs the system
and creates interference, making it impossible to stabilize properties
independently.</p>
<p>The author argues that this perspective is aligned with John
Wheeler’s observer-participancy but incorporated into an ontological
account of material processes and interactions. She proposes that
quantum measurements should be reconceptualized as choices rather than
discoveries, reflecting the agentive nature of quantum interactions.</p>
<p>Ismael discusses various interpretations of quantum mechanics
(Everettian quantum mechanics, relational quantum mechanics, retrocausal
interpretation) to illustrate how these theories accommodate this
participatory view while maintaining an objective ontology. She
concludes by emphasizing that the deep insight of Wheeler was the
breakdown of the epistemic/ontic distinction, revealing the ultimate
inseparability of subject and object, self and world, and representation
and represented.</p>
<p>The paper contributes to the ongoing debate on quantum foundations by
offering a perspective that respects the reality of an objective world
while acknowledging the participatory nature of our interactions with
it, particularly at the quantum level.</p>

<p>The author, presumably a physicist or philosopher of science, is
responding to Peter Lewis’ paper “Uncertainty and Probability for
Branching Selves,” particularly focusing on the concept of uncertainty
in Everett’s many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Acknowledgment of Error</strong>: The author begins by
acknowledging a mistake in their previous work, conceding that there
isn’t genuine pre-measurement uncertainty in a literally branching world
according to the Everett interpretation. They had previously argued for
such uncertainty but now recognize this as incorrect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpretation of Born Probabilities</strong>: The
author’s project was to provide a physical interpretation for the Born
probabilities within an Everett universe. They propose that these
probabilities represent degrees of surprise from a post-measurement
perspective, rather than assigning expectation values to future events.
This interpretation maintains that the Born probability of an up-result
in a spin measurement is the probability of observing an up result at a
location in one of the post-measurement branches, picked out by ‘here’,
which refers to different locations for each post-measurement
successor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Empirical Coherence</strong>: The author argues against
Lewis’ claim that without an interpretation for Born probabilities in an
Everett universe, the view is empirically incoherent. They contend that
their proposed interpretation satisfies this requirement as it
constrains long-term frequencies of measurement results in the universe
and along each branch, leading to agreement with observed
frequencies—the same way as in a Copenhagen interpretation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prediction vs. Confirmation</strong>: The author
disagrees with Lewis’ interpretation of what constitutes a prediction
for a theory. While acknowledging that probabilities must be assignable
before measurements to confirm the theory, the author argues that this
requirement is not met only by theories making predictions about future
events but also by historical theories like continental drift or
evolution, which have no predictive power in Lewis’ sense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sleeping Beauty</strong>: The author briefly discusses
the Sleeping Beauty problem and argues against using reflection
principles or intertemporal consistency constraints to generate
pre-measurement uncertainty. They propose that the relevant question for
Sleeping Beauty isn’t about changing probabilities upon discovering what
scientists plan to do, but rather her level of certainty about attending
a concert on Tuesday after waking up.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indefinite Probabilities</strong>: The author defends the
existence of indefinite probabilities (probabilities of event types
approached by relative frequencies) in an Everett universe, contrasting
this with Lewis’ claim that there should be no place for probability
within Everett’s theory. They argue that identifying particular outcomes
to which definite probabilities could attach pre-measurement is
ill-defined from a pre-measurement perspective, not the identification
of event types (both pre- and post-measurement) itself.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the author agrees with Lewis’ correction about there
being no genuine pre-measurement uncertainty in Everett’s branching
universe but disputes his broader claims regarding empirical coherence
and the nature of predictions in quantum theory interpretations. The
author proposes interpreting Born probabilities as degrees of surprise
after measurements, maintaining that this interpretation can be
empirically adequate and consistent with observational data gathered by
situated observers along their respective branches.</p>

<p>The paper discusses the challenges in understanding thermodynamic
phenomena from a microphysical perspective. It focuses on David Albert’s
book “Time and Chance” and his use of the Past Hypothesis (PH) to
reconcile Newtonian mechanics with thermodynamics. The author argues
that while PH is necessary for generating thermodynamic generalizations,
it doesn’t provide a satisfactory explanation of why these
generalizations should hold in our world specifically.</p>
<p>The author critiques the global interpretation of PH, which pushes
the uniform probability distribution over microstates compatible with
macroconditions back to the beginning of the universe. This approach,
while maintaining consistency with mechanics, makes the content of the
probability distribution mostly extrinsic to the actual world. The
author suggests that a more intelligible explanation requires
understanding why there are general mechanisms in place that produce
thermodynamic behavior regardless of initial conditions or under almost
all choices of initial conditions.</p>
<p>The author proposes two potential solutions: the Shuffling Hypothesis
and the Leeds proposal. Both provide local mixing mechanisms to ensure
that exogenous influences on open systems are typically random, thereby
explaining why microstates are evenly distributed across compatible
states. These proposals discharge the need for a global probability
distribution over initial conditions in favor of assumptions about
unbalanced perturbing influences.</p>
<p>The Shuffling Hypothesis introduces internal randomizing mechanisms
that stabilize relative frequencies at the local level, addressing
explanatory lacunae in Albert’s account. It offers a purely mechanical
understanding of thermodynamic phenomena from a microphysical
perspective. On the other hand, the Leeds proposal suggests a dynamical
explanation for the initial conditions’ adherence to SP by appealing to
our intuition about what constitutes ‘special’ or ‘ordered’ initial
conditions without requiring a primitive measure over them.</p>
<p>In summary, the paper critiques Albert’s global approach to PH and
proposes alternative solutions that offer more intelligible mechanical
explanations of thermodynamic phenomena. The Shuffling Hypothesis and
Leeds proposal both aim to provide local mechanisms for ensuring
randomness in open systems, dispensing with a primitive sense of
specialness over initial conditions and highlighting the local
mechanisms that make anti-thermodynamic behavior atypical.</p>
<h3 id="curies-principle">Curies-Principle</h3>
<p><strong>Curie’s Principle: Summary and Explanation</strong></p>
<p>Curie’s Principle, proposed by Pierre Curie in 1894, states that the
symmetry of a cause (Curie-cause) is always preserved in its effects
(Curie-effect). This principle has been subject to criticism and
misinterpretation, often dismissed as false or irrelevant. However,
Jenann Ismael argues for its truth and significance in physics and
philosophy of science.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Definition of Curie-Cause and Effect</strong>: A physical
theory specifies the structure and relationships between objects. For
any such theory, there is a many-one mapping from possible
specifications of a Curie-cause (A) to specifications of its effect (B).
In other words, A determines B according to the laws of the
theory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry</strong>: Symmetries are transformations that
preserve certain aspects of the system. Characteristic symmetries apply
to all specifications of a cause or effect, while idiosyncratic
symmetries only apply to some.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Principle Statement</strong>: Curie’s Principle asserts
that all characteristic symmetries of a Curie-cause are also
characteristic symmetries of its effect. Conversely, any idiosyncratic
asymmetry in the effect must correspond to an idiosyncratic asymmetry in
the cause.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proof</strong>: The proof is straightforward from
definitions. If Curie’s Principle were false, it would imply a
characteristic symmetry of the cause not present in its effect,
violating determinism. Deterministic laws ensure that each cause has a
unique effect, preserving all relevant symmetries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: The principle’s physical
significance lies in understanding how symmetries relate causes and
effects. Symmetries of a set of equations (laws) correspond to
permutations of irrelevant parameters or compensating transformations of
relevant parameters, preserving the described relation. Geometric
symmetries can be understood similarly once formulated
covariantly.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ismael’s Defense</strong>: She argues against common
objections: - The principle is a priori, addressing empirical questions
appropriately by focusing on the logical structure of causes and
effects. - ‘Spontaneous symmetry breaking’ (SSB) doesn’t contradict it;
SSB refers to idiosyncratic asymmetries in specific instances rather
than violating Curie’s Principle. - The principle applies in
indeterministic contexts, guiding how to conceptualize causes and
effects even when outcomes aren’t uniquely determined. - It’s not empty
but profoundly informative about the nature of physical laws and their
symmetries.</p>
<p><strong>Implications</strong>: Recognizing Curie’s Principle can
enhance our understanding of symmetry in physics, guiding how we
interpret laws and their implications for causes and effects. It
underscores that symmetries aren’t just mathematical niceties but carry
profound physical meaning.</p>
<p>The text discusses Curie’s Principle, a concept in physics that
relates the symmetries of an effect (B) to those of its cause (A). The
principle is outlined as follows: if A causes B and T is a geometric
transformation under which A remains invariant while B does not, then
either A or the conditions determining A were asymmetric.</p>
<p>The author highlights potential tensions in our understanding of
initial conditions, suggesting that what we typically consider as
initial conditions (sufficient to ensure an effect’s appearance) may not
align with the full specification of a Curie-cause. This is because
initial conditions usually exclude certain aspects of a system’s
intrinsic spatiotemporal structures that distinguish systems related by
non-symmetry transformations, which might be crucial in specifying the
cause (A).</p>
<p>Doubts about Curie’s Principle stem from various misconceptions. One
is the assumption of determinism, as the world might be indeterministic,
meaning we cannot infer past asymmetries solely based on current
conditions. The principle should be reformulated to state that we can
infer either an asymmetric A or no A when B exhibits an asymmetry.</p>
<p>Another doubt arises from restricting what counts as a cause in such
a way that intrinsic features only are considered causes, excluding
aspects like the state of motion of a system. However, this restricted
notion of cause is inconsistent with examples Curie used and our general
scientific practice.</p>
<p>A prevalent doubt originates from a faulty definition of symmetry,
exemplified by A.F. Chalmers’ misunderstanding. Chalmers defined
symmetries as transformations that leave the mathematical form of laws
unchanged, leading to confusion in situations where laws predict
different outcomes for symmetric initial conditions due to inherent
asymmetries in the laws themselves.</p>
<p>The principle’s applicability in indeterministic contexts is also
discussed. The author argues that while deterministic laws map
state-descriptions onto other state-descriptions, indeterministic laws
map them onto probability functions. Curie’s Principle can still apply
here; the asymmetry of an effect results from an asymmetric probability
distribution over possible states, not individual events.</p>
<p>The principle offers a criterion for distinguishing between chance
and law-governed aspects of a system in indeterministic contexts. The
‘coarse state’ describes the complete state-description with unit
probability, while ‘fine states’ are those with non-zero probabilities.
Transformations that are symmetries of the coarse state but not fine
states are considered permutations of chance features.</p>
<p>Finally, the text addresses spontaneous symmetry breaking—phenomena
often thought to contradict Curie’s Principle. The author argues that
these phenomena do not actually violate the principle. For instance,
Euler buckling (a rod bending under load) might seem like a violation
because an initially symmetric system becomes asymmetric when loaded
beyond a critical point. However, this apparent symmetry breaking is due
to the introduction of boundary conditions (the weight distribution and
support at the base), which are not invariant under all possible
transformations, thus aligning with Curie’s Principle.</p>
<p>Curie’s Principle, as interpreted by Jennan Ismael, asserts that if
certain causes (A) produce specific effects (B), then the symmetry
elements of the causes must be present in the produced effects. The
principle is not violated when symmetry breaks spontaneously due to
non-linear dynamics or external perturbations. Instead, it suggests that
there are hidden asymmetries in the initial state, which become apparent
under certain conditions.</p>
<p>In more detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Symmetry Breaking</strong>: The principle does not
contradict instances of symmetry breaking, like those observed in liquid
heating experiments or fluid masses rotation. These phenomena occur when
a scalar parameter reaches a critical value, causing the system to
transition from a symmetric state to an asymmetric one. This is possible
because the symmetry of the initial state is larger than that of the
resulting state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-linear Dynamics</strong>: The principle also
accommodates non-linear dynamics where small changes in parameters can
lead to large, seemingly asymmetrical effects. In such cases, the causes
are not entirely symmetrical; they contain hidden fluctuations or minute
asymmetries that only become apparent under specific conditions (like
reaching a critical parameter value).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hidden Variables</strong>: Curie’s Principle is connected
to the concept of hidden variables – attributes of a system that are not
directly observable but influence its behavior. If A is the cause of B,
and B exhibits an asymmetry T, then at least one characteristic of A
must also be asymmetric concerning T. This hidden asymmetry might not be
immediately apparent in the causes but emerges under certain conditions
or through careful analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deterministic Evolution</strong>: In deterministic
systems, if an initially symmetric state evolves into an apparently
asymmetric state, Curie’s Principle implies that the initial state
contained hidden asymmetries. For instance, molecular biological
processes like frog zygote development, which seems symmetrical at each
stage but introduces increasing asymmetry over time, are consistent with
this principle. The apparent symmetry of early stages conceals inherent
asymmetries that manifest later.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Applicability to Physical Theories</strong>: When
combined with a methodological principle requiring hidden variables only
as nomological determinants of observable asymmetries, Curie’s Principle
restricts the range of acceptable physical theories. It suggests that
the hidden causes postulated by our theories should collectively conceal
as much, if not more, asymmetry as is revealed in their
effects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exegetical Support</strong>: Ismael argues that Curie
intended his principle to apply to characteristic symmetries of cause
and effect families rather than specific instances. This interpretation
avoids counterexamples and aligns with how Curie applied the principle
in his original paper to derive intrinsic symmetries of physical
quantities like electric and magnetic fields.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, Curie’s Principle, as interpreted by Ismael, is not
trivial but rather a profound statement about the relationship between
cause and effect, symmetry, and hidden variables. It underscores that
apparent symmetries in effects often mask underlying, hidden asymmetries
in causes – a concept with far-reaching implications across physics and
beyond.</p>
<p>The text discusses Curie’s Principle, a concept in physics and
philosophy that relates symmetries in physical systems to their causes
and effects.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Curie’s Principle</strong>: The principle states that if
a transformation (T) leaves the cause (A) of an effect (B) unchanged but
alters B itself, then T is not a characteristic symmetry of A. In other
words, any asymmetry in the effect must be mirrored in its cause when
viewed through the lens of physical laws.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physical Laws as Functions</strong>: The author
recommends viewing physical laws as functions from one set of states
(domain) to another (range). This perspective makes it easier to
understand relationships between physical figures or systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry in Physical Laws</strong>: Curie’s Principle
highlights the importance of symmetries in understanding physical laws.
It suggests that if a law describes a simple relation between symmetries
in domain and range, this can lead to conclusions about hidden
structures that might not be apparent otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Historical Context</strong>: The text contrasts the
approaches of Sophus Lie and Pierre Curie. While Lie emphasized
symmetries as mathematical properties of physical laws, Curie focused on
the characteristic symmetries of physical states themselves.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Applications of Curie’s Principle</strong>: The principle
has various applications, such as guiding the postulation of hidden
variables in theoretical models and providing a criterion for separating
chancy aspects of a system’s evolution from its deterministic parts. It
also aids in understanding causal relationships between physical
phenomena.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-Generally Covariant Formulations</strong>: The text
delves into the nuances of dynamical theories, explaining how they can
be formulated without and with covariance (or coordinate invariance),
and how symmetries play a role in each formulation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philosophical Implications</strong>: Curie’s Principle
suggests an understanding of causality where A is causally relevant to B
if the laws governing B are not symmetric regarding arbitrary
permutations of A’s values, and if (counterfactually) Ai occurred, then
Bi would also have occurred. This perspective echoes traditional
scientific understanding but provides a more robust framework for
considering hidden structures in physical systems.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, Curie’s Principle underscores the profound connection
between symmetries in physical phenomena and their underlying causes,
offering a powerful tool for unraveling complex systems’ hidden
structures through the study of observable asymmetries.</p>

<p>Title: How to Combine Chance and Determinism: Thinking about the
Future in an Everett Universe* Author: Jenann Ismael Published:
Philosophy of Science, Vol. 70, No. 4 (October 2003)</p>
<p>Jenann Ismael’s paper discusses how to reconcile the principles of
chance and determinism in the context of Everett interpretations of
quantum mechanics, also known as Many Worlds or Multi-World Theories.
These theories propose that every quantum event results in multiple
parallel universes (or “worlds”), each representing a possible
outcome.</p>
<p>Ismael argues for an understanding where there can be genuine
uncertainty about future events despite the deterministic nature of the
universe and the complete knowledge of initial conditions. She
challenges the tendency among Everettians to incorporate consciousness
or non-physical elements into their physical description.</p>
<p>Key Points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Everett Universe</strong>: The universe is depicted as an
infinite branching set of histories, represented by a tree-like
structure where each node corresponds to a measurement, and branches
represent possible outcomes. Each sequence of results is realized in
this structure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probability Interpretation</strong>: Providing an
interpretation for probability (a measure over the space of histories)
in an Everett universe requires three elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A method to extract a tree-like universe from the universal wave
function without using a preferred basis.</li>
<li>Showing how chance can arise within a deterministic context.</li>
<li>Defending Born’s Rule as the quantitative method for calculating
probabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>The Problem</strong>: Deterministic evolution of the
universe according to Schrodinger’s equation doesn’t leave room for
chancy events, and this is especially problematic in Everett
interpretations where all possible outcomes are realized in different
branches. The challenge is to find something in an Everett universe for
Born probabilities to attach to without introducing non-physical
elements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preliminary Attempt</strong>: Ismael suggests that the
key lies in identifying ‘picking’ events in the history, i.e., points
where outcomes are selected according to Born’s probabilities. However,
due to the symmetrical nature of branches in an Everett universe, it
seems impossible to pinpoint a unique trajectory or world for the
probabilities to pertain to without invoking non-physical facts about
personal identity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Second Pass</strong>: The author proposes that one need
not single out a specific trajectory (or ‘humunculus’) as uniquely
‘mine’. Instead, Born’s probabilities can be interpreted as giving the
probability of obtaining an up-result at a location in a
post-measurement branch of the universe. Each observer uses Born’s Rule
to compute probabilities for their respective worlds based on their
pre-measurement histories. This approach doesn’t require
non-supervenient facts about personal identity or non-physical relations
between person stages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complications</strong>: The major complication lies in
the fact that individual measurement results cannot be identified
descriptively from a pre-measurement perspective due to symmetrical
relations they bear with the pre-measurement history. This leads to
linguistic awkwardness but does not undermine the Everett picture, as no
non-physical elements are added.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Global Determinism and Local Chanciness</strong>: Ismael
explains how global determinism can coexist with local chanciness by
highlighting that symmetries in the universe allow for events to occur
without being determined by their histories, creating a form of internal
indeterminism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The paper concludes by emphasizing
the importance of understanding personal identity within a deterministic
framework and the role of indexical language in describing individual
experiences without invoking non-physical entities. It also highlights
how this approach can help combat the tendency to incorporate
consciousness or homunculi into physical descriptions, maintaining a
purely physical interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p></li>

<h3 id="quantum-holism">Quantum-Holism</h3>
<p>The text discusses the interpretive pressure in quantum mechanics
towards a common ground explanation for entangled systems, rather than
positing new fundamental relations or treating components as distinct
entities with additional entanglement relations. Two examples of
holistic views are presented: Spacetime State Realism Streamlined and
Wave Function Realism.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Spacetime State Realism Streamlined</strong>: This
ontology posits the whole spacetime bearing a density operator as
fundamental, with subsystems (like Alice and Bob) recoverable through
partial trace operations. The idea is that entangled wholes are more
fundamental than their parts, and the cosmos as a whole forms one vast
entangled system due to initial entanglement at the Big Bang and
Schrödinger evolution spreading entanglements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wave Function Realism</strong>: This view treats the wave
function in conﬁguration space (and perhaps the world-particle) as
fundamental. The shape of the wave (and possibly the position of the
world-particle) explains the coordinated behavior of Alice and Bob from
a common source, even though it may seem to have multiple independent
degrees of freedom at first glance. The text argues that these degrees
of freedom are not actually independent due to global constraints on the
wave function’s squared amplitudes and entanglement properties.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The main argument against positing new fundamental relations or
treating components as distinct entities with additional entanglement
relations is that it introduces unnecessary complexity without empirical
support. The text also contrasts this holistic approach with an
alternative, which posits new entanglement relations alongside
spatiotemporal relations but does not treat components as joint
manifestations of a common ground.</p>
<p>Finally, the text revisits Einstein’s objection to quantum mechanics’
“holism,” which stems from his belief that spatial separation implies
metaphysical separation (Einstein’s Inference). However, the authors
side with Bohr and argue that there are no compelling empirical or
conceptual grounds for this connection between spatial separation and
metaphysical grounding.</p>
<p>In summary, the text advocates for common ground explanations of
quantum entanglement, such as Spacetime State Realism Streamlined and
Wave Function Realism, over alternative approaches involving new
fundamental relations or treating components as distinct entities with
additional entanglement relations. These holistic views are favored due
to their simplicity, consistency with empirical evidence, and lack of ad
hoc complexity.</p>
<p>The text discusses the implications of quantum mechanics for
philosophical views on reality, specifically focusing on Einstein’s
notion of locality (referred to as “Einstein’s Inference”). This
inference suggests that if two entities are spatially separated, they
must be distinct existences.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Common Ground Explanations</strong>: The authors propose
extending the concept of common cause explanations to common ground
explanations and further generalize them to common source explanations.
They suggest that interpretations of quantum mechanics permitting a
common source explanation of nonseparability gain plausibility in this
way.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spacetime State Realism Streamlined</strong>: This view
posits the whole material cosmos as fundamental, with Alice and Bob
(spacially separated individuals) not being distinct existences because
they are grounded in the whole. Therefore, rejecting Einstein’s
Inference outright is a logical consequence of this
perspective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wave Function Realism</strong>: Here, the fundamental
space isn’t necessarily manifest 3-dimensional space. Instead, it could
be a more abstract configuration space from which our familiar
three-dimensional space emerges.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Einstein’s Inference, Manifest</strong>: If non-identical
entities are spatially separated in our everyday 3D space, they’re
distinct existences. This principle is implausible under Wave Function
Realism as it treats 3D space as an emergent phenomenon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Einstein’s Inference, Fundamental</strong>: If
non-identical entities are spatially separated in the more fundamental
space (like configuration space), they’re distinct existences. This
version of Einstein’s Inference can be upheld by Wave Function Realists
without implying that our 3D space is fundamental.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Discomfort with Atomistic Views</strong>: The authors
argue that any discomfort with quantum holism stems from a background
assumption of an atomistic picture, where fundamental entities are seen
as independent bits in familiar 3D space. Quantum mechanics challenges
this view.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the text explores how different interpretations of
quantum mechanics navigate Einstein’s Inference and highlights that
plausibility can be found when these interpretations allow for a common
source explanation of nonseparability (like Spacetime State Realism
Streamlined or Wave Function Realism with its Fundamental version of
Einstein’s Inference). It underscores how our intuitive, atomistic view
of reality might not align with the implications of quantum
mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="realism-without-reification">Realism-without-Reification</h3>
<p>The text discusses the philosophical and scientific exploration of
temporal experience from two main perspectives: Heraclitian (the
universe as an absolute, irreversible process) and Parmenidean (a fixed
four-dimensional block of events). It delves into how we, as embodied
participants, experience time through asymmetry, flow, passage, and the
fixity of the past with openness towards the future.</p>
<p>The author introduces two key concepts: Temporally Embedded Momentary
Perspective (TEMP) and Temporally Evolving Point of View (TEvPoV). TEMP
represents a snapshot of time from an individual’s current perspective,
encompassing perceptual experiences with finite temporal breadth and
embedded in a psychological context rich with memory. TEvPoV, on the
other hand, is the progression of views over a life as a whole,
stringing together TEMPs according to their temporal parameter.</p>
<p>The author also outlines how such temporal structures could be built
within a cognitive system: starting from sensory input, introducing
temporality into representational states, allowing recursive memory, and
generating an autobiographical history. This leads to the emergence of
decision-making capabilities that influence future representations.</p>
<p>The paper highlights several features of temporal experience, such as
the finite duration of perceptual states, the abundant internal
structuring along the temporal dimension, and a directional flow of
information through perception, memory, and decision processes. It
underscores how Heraclitian properties like flow, passage, and openness
emerge from changes in perspective relative to an absolute time
background.</p>
<p>The text also explores the relationship between these subjective
experiences and objective scientific views of time. While some argue
that the flow of time is an illusion (e.g., Gold), others suggest it’s a
fundamental aspect of reality (Ellis, Norton). The author concludes by
suggesting physics’ increasing move towards an absolute view of time
might be better understood when we consider how our experiences arise
from this perspective.</p>
<p>In essence, the text explores the complex interplay between
subjective temporal experience and objective scientific descriptions of
time, proposing that understanding these connections can enrich both
philosophical and physical interpretations of time.</p>
<h3
id="review-of-the-blind-spot-nature-physics">Review-of-the-Blind-Spot-Nature-Physics</h3>
<p>“The Blind Spot: Why Science Cannot Ignore Human Experience” is a
book written by Adam Frank, Marcelo Gleiser, and Evan Thompson,
published by MIT Press (2024). The authors explore the idea that
science’s traditional approach to understanding reality often overlooks
human experience.</p>
<p>The central argument of the book revolves around the concept of
‘articulation,’ a process where an organism begins to distinguish
between its subjective experiences and objective realities. Initially,
this distinction is not conscious; everything perceived is part of one’s
inner world. However, as this process develops, entities like visual
images or sounds gain dual significance—they are both personal sensory
experiences and manifestations of an external world.</p>
<p>The authors contend that science, in its quest for a complete and
abstract understanding of the universe, has displaced human experience.
They argue that this displacement is problematic, contributing to
scientific, social, and spiritual issues. These include a
misunderstanding of fundamental concepts like time, life, cosmos,
consciousness, and quantum mechanics, as well as a growing rift between
humans and nature leading to environmental crises.</p>
<p>The authors identify several ways in which science has overlooked
experience. For instance, they criticize the interpretation of
Einstein’s relativity theory, arguing that while it correctly describes
the four-dimensional structure of the universe, equating this
mathematical representation with ‘time itself’ is a mistake. They assert
that doing so confuses the map (the mathematical model) with the
territory (the lived experience of time).</p>
<p>Instead of advocating for adding subjective experience as a new
physical field or quantity into science, the authors propose
repositioning human experience at the center of our reality conception
without reducing it to a mere aspect. They aim to bridge the gap between
objective and subjective understandings, showing how abstract scientific
concepts are rooted in human experience rather than replace or diminish
it.</p>
<p>The book does not provide a solution on integrating experience into
the physical world objectively but instead questions why and how our
perception becomes separate from the external world. The authors propose
returning to the pre-fissure state where existence and experience were
synonymous, thereby understanding how scientific abstractions are
grounded in human experiences.</p>
<p>The reviewer, Jenann Ismael from Johns Hopkins University, commends
the book for its powerful diagnosis of fundamental philosophical issues
in contemporary science and its challenge to established orthodoxies.
She argues that while one might not initially agree with the authors,
their argument is compelling and hard to ignore once understood.</p>
<p>In essence, “The Blind Spot” presents a critique of the scientific
worldview’s tendency to exclude human experience, suggesting that
reintegrating subjective experience into our understanding of reality
could lead to a more holistic view of the universe.</p>

id="simplicity-as-guide-to-scientific-metaphysics">Simplicity-as-Guide-to-Scientific-Metaphysics</h3>
<p>The text discusses the role of simplicity in scientific modeling,
particularly in physics. It argues that simplicity is a crucial
criterion for constructing models due to its ability to provide powerful
and accurate inductive hypotheses. The author uses the concept of
degrees of freedom as a measure of complexity, with simpler models
better capturing the compositional structure of the world up to the
level discernible by macroscopic effects.</p>
<p>The preference for simplicity is not about generating models that
reproduce observed behavior compactly but also about making new
predictions and guiding interventions. The author distinguishes between
data gathering, processing, and modeling, with the latter being
essential for artful induction leading to novel phenomena and
discovery.</p>
<p>The text addresses potential objections: (i) the abstract nature of
degrees of freedom does not distinguish different accounts of
compositional structure; (ii) rearranging points in phase space can
alter dimensionality; (iii) simple descriptions neutral about underlying
structure may suffice; and (iv) quantum mechanics challenges classical
ontology. The author responds by clarifying that simplicity is an
auxiliary goal, with the primary interest being powerful and accurate
predictions.</p>
<p>The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of simplicity in
scientific modeling, as it unifies various theoretical practices and
explanatory principles. It suggests that simplicity can serve as a
unifying focus for understanding a wide range of aspects in science.</p>

<p>Title: Space, Quantum Mechanics, and Bohm’s Fish Tank</p>
<p>Author: Jenann Ismael</p>
<p>In this chapter from “The Foundation of Reality: Fundamentality,
Space, and Time,” Jenann Ismael explores the possibility that space
might not be a fundamental structure in physics. This idea is motivated
by considerations from cosmology and quantum gravity, where many
theories describe fundamental structures that are
non-spatiotemporal.</p>
<p>The chapter focuses on two key aspects of quantum mechanics:
entanglement and complementarity. To elucidate these concepts, Ismael
introduces low-dimensional examples that mimic features of quantum
phenomena while avoiding the technical complexities often associated
with them.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Bohm’s Fishtank</strong>: This example involves a 3D fish
tank filmed from both front and side by two cameras projecting their
images onto a 2D screen in an adjacent room. An observer conﬁned to this
2D screen would notice correlations between the images (for instance, if
one image shows a lionfish’s tail from the side, the corresponding image
will show it from the front). These correlations seem instantaneous but
are actually due to redundancy in the space where the fish images
appear—a lower-dimensional projection of the actual 3D tank. This
example mirrors entanglement in quantum mechanics, where two particles
can be correlated without direct interaction or signaling through
spacetime.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complementarity</strong>: Ismael illustrates
complementarity using the fish tank scenario. Certain aspects of a
fish’s appearance (like front and back) are mutually exclusive; you
cannot see both at once on the 2D screen, just as certain quantum
observables (like position and momentum) are complementary—you can’t
simultaneously measure them precisely due to Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle. This occlusion in the fish tank corresponds to
non-commutativity of quantum observables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Ismael then discusses two types of causal notions and spaces:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Causal Notions</strong>: The directed acyclic graph (DAG)
representation captures causal relationships by intervention
counterfactuals, while causal processes involve exchanges of conserved
quantities. In quantum mechanics, the search for such clear-cut causal
processes in spacetime has led to various interpretations denying the
necessity for them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notions of Space</strong>: Ismael distinguishes between
‘Our-space’ (the manifest space we experience) and ‘Ur-space’ (a
hypothetical underlying space that might explain quantum phenomena). She
argues that treating Our-space as an “image space” could resolve the
puzzles of entanglement and complementarity without needing extra
dimensions or hidden variables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The author concludes by emphasizing that this perspective isn’t
driven by metaphysical predilections but rather by clues in quantum
phenomena, suggesting a shift from viewing Our-space as fundamental to
seeing it as a derivative structure emerging from a more fundamental
Ur-space. This view aligns with the broader trend in modern physics of
treating space and spacetime as emergent, derived structures rather than
fundamental entities.</p>

<p>Title: Symmetry as a Guide to Superfluous Theoretical Structure</p>
<p>Authors: Jenann Ismael and Bas C. van Fraassen</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The article explores the role of symmetries in identifying
superfluous theoretical structure within physical theories. The authors
aim to provide a general framework applicable to all theories,
addressing philosophical problems related to the nature of scientific
theories and their representations.</p>
<p>Key Concepts: 1. Superfluous Structure: Excess elements or relations
in a theory that are dispensable for its intended purpose but may have
relevance from other perspectives (e.g., aesthetic, historical). 2.
Theory Structure: A structured set of possibilities (possibility space)
comprising an initial framework (ontology) and laws selecting physical
possibilities. 3. Qualitative vs Measurable Quantities: The distinction
between directly observable features accessible through perception and
quantifiable values that may not have a direct observational
correspondence but are still measurable under specific conditions. 4.
Symmetries of Theory (ToT): Transformations preserving the satisfaction
or non-satisfaction of laws, acting on the initial possibility space;
they need not preserve any particular characteristic of physically
possible worlds. 5. Qualitative Structure Preservation: A subset of ToTs
that also conserves qualitative features in every model, serving as a
guide to identify superfluous structure.</p>
<p>Arguments and Key Points: 1. The authors introduce the idea that
symmetries can help determine superfluous theoretical structure by
identifying transformations preserving qualitative but not necessarily
quantitative aspects of worlds (physical possibilities). These are
qualified as trivial, implying redundant structures within a theory. 2.
They argue against interpretations that would equate symmetries with
essential features, claiming such views lead to overly restrictive
conclusions and fail to capture the complexity inherent in physical
theories. 3. The authors critique Belot’s (2001) interpretation of
Leibniz’s Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR), which suggests
identifying qualitatively identical worlds as a way to minimize
superfluous structure. They provide counterexamples, such as a simple
theory involving triangles and squares, where symmetries do not preserve
qualitative structures while still mapping physically possible worlds
onto each other. 4. The authors emphasize the distinction between
qualitative-structure-preserving symmetries of laws (indicating
superfluous structure) and symmetries of a world, which merely map it
into itself without revealing any physical redundancy or excess
structure. 5. They highlight the importance of symmetry in theory
construction as an essential tool for understanding the intrinsic
character of represented phenomena by simplifying models while
preserving their capacity to embed observed facts. 6. The authors stress
that eliminating superfluous structures is not just a cleanup process
after formulation but lies at the heart of theorizing, guiding
researchers in developing simpler, more accurate representations of
reality. 7. Throughout the discussion, they illustrate how historical
developments in quantum mechanics exemplify this two-stage process of
generating rich models and subsequently simplifying them by exposing and
eliminating excess structure.</p>
<p>Implications: 1. Symmetries can be used to identify superfluous
theoretical structures within physical theories, helping researchers
create more parsimonious representations of reality without losing
empirical content. 2. The concept of qualitative-structure-preserving
symmetries of laws serves as a guide for distinguishing between
essential and redundant features in scientific theories. 3. This
approach underscores the significance of formal simplicity in modern
physics, where ontologies are shaped by mathematical elegance rather
than philosophical prejudices or physical intuition.</p>

id="symmetry_and_superfluous_structure">Symmetry_and_superfluous_structure</h3>
<p>The chapter by Jenann Ismael discusses a method for identifying and
removing superfluous structure in theoretical formalisms, particularly
focusing on space-time physics. This method employs mathematical
symmetries to guide the process of understanding the fundamental
ontology or degrees of freedom in nature.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Historical Context</strong>: Pre-scientific metaphysics
relied heavily on imagination to infer insights into reality. As
complexity increased, mathematics emerged as an essential tool for
recognizing and uncovering hidden patterns within vast data sets. This
shift is evident from Galileo’s discovery of the pendulum law (1602) to
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion (1609, 1619), where imagination was
complemented by mathematical regularities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathematical Methods in Physics</strong>: Mathematics
enables physicists to compactly represent large bodies of data and
reveal regularities hidden within phenomena. It provides a means for
transforming complex pattern-recognition problems into simpler,
first-order problems that the biological brain can handle more
effectively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identifying Dynamical Symmetries</strong>: The central
idea is to identify symmetries in the laws of motion (dynamical
symmetries) that map solutions onto empirically indistinguishable
counterparts, which are physically equivalent situations. This process
helps eliminate dynamically irrelevant structure and results in a more
concise description of the underlying ontology or state space.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Example: From Newtonian to Galilean Space-Time</strong>:
Initially, Newton’s mechanics was formulated against an absolute space
and time with rich geometric structure (E3 for space and real line for
time). However, observing symmetries like Galilean boosts that mapped
physically distinct solutions onto indistinguishable ones, it became
apparent that Newtonian Mechanics recognized physical structures
irrelevant to dynamics. By eliminating point identity over time while
retaining absolute acceleration distinctions between inertial and
non-inertial motion but not absolute rest and velocity, Galilean
space-time emerged.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Special Relativity (STR)</strong>: As phenomena resisted
Newtonian treatment, STR replaced it. Here, symmetries of the laws that
map solutions onto empirically indistinguishable counterparts led to the
elimination of geometric structures not invariant under Poincare
transformations, resulting in Minkowski space-time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General Relativity (GR)</strong>: GR’s dynamics aren’t
defined against a fixed background space-time; instead, multiple
distinct solutions are possible. Using diffeomorphisms to identify
physically equivalent solutions, one can construct the reduced state
space by treating structures not invariant under these transformations
as insignificant. This approach avoids unobservable indeterminism and
allows for an interpretation of GR without the Hole Argument.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenges</strong>: Implementing this method isn’t
straightforward due to various difficulties: determining which structure
is physically meaningful, excising superfluous structure while
preserving essential dynamics, and interpreting results
judiciously.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gauge Theories</strong>: This method extends beyond
space-time theories to non-space-time ones like electrostatics,
electromagnetism, or quantum mechanics, focusing on internal symmetries
that alter values representing a system’s internal degrees of freedom.
Local and global gauge symmetries present unique challenges in
identifying physically meaningful structures.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why the Method Works</strong>: Despite lacking an a
priori logical principle guaranteeing its success, two promising routes
suggest why this method works: (i) evidential rationality shifting
burden of proof by demanding empirical distinguishability for structures
related by symmetry, and (ii) issues about reference and redundancy in
formalism.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, this chapter illustrates how mathematical symmetries
guide physicists in excising superfluous structure from their theories,
leading to more parsimonious descriptions of nature’s fundamental
ontology. The method is rooted in historical success, though open
questions remain about its justification and applicability.</p>

id="tls-the-impossible-man-by-patchen-barss-_-book-review-">TLS-The-Impossible-Man-by-Patchen-Barss-_-Book-review-</h3>
<p>The text is a book review of “The Impossible Man: Roger Penrose and
the Cost of Genius” by Patchen Barss, focusing on the life and work of
renowned mathematician and physicist Sir Roger Penrose. The review
provides an overview of Penrose’s contributions to science, particularly
his groundbreaking work on black holes and twistor theory, while also
delving into his personal life.</p>
<p>Penrose is celebrated for his intellectual leaps, which often seem to
stem from epiphanies rather than conventional calculation methods. His
discovery of the existence of black holes in 1964, through a sudden
insight during a casual conversation with colleague Ivor Robinson,
exemplifies this. This finding was later confirmed as one of the most
significant post-Einsteinian results in general relativity and led to
the popularization of the term “black hole.”</p>
<p>Penrose’s geometric approach to problem-solving is highlighted, where
he manipulates pieces of information until they coalesce into a
comprehensive understanding. This contrasts with the more common
brute-force method, which relies on extensive calculations.</p>
<p>The book also explores Penrose’s personal life, revealing his timid
nature and complex relationships. His first marriage was reportedly
unfulfilling, and he later fell in love with Judith, a woman many years
his junior. Correspondence between the two is quoted extensively,
offering an intimate portrayal of their relationship.</p>
<p>However, the reviewer questions the necessity of focusing so intently
on Penrose’s personal life when his intellectual contributions are so
monumental. The book presents a contrast between Penrose’s ordinary
persona and the immense scope of his ideas, which might be its central
thematic point.</p>
<p>Penrose’s later work, including twistor theory and conformal cyclic
cosmology, is described as evidence of his unrelenting creativity and
intellectual fearlessness. Despite facing criticism from experts for his
theories on consciousness, which suggest that it can’t be computed due
to Gödel’s incompleteness results, Penrose remains optimistic about his
contributions to understanding this complex phenomenon.</p>
<p>Overall, while Barss provides a meticulously researched and personal
account of Penrose’s life, the review suggests that the book might have
benefited from focusing more on the intellectual journey that led to
Penrose’s groundbreaking discoveries rather than his romantic
relationships and domestic life.</p>
