\section*{\color{cyberred} The Empire of Opaque Code}
In 1675, Leibniz fought Newton to keep calculus free. In 1668, John Wilkins pitched a "Universal Language" so absurd it made a king cringe. Today, we battle math empires—Wolfram Language, MATLAB, and their ilk—that lock knowledge behind paywalls and black boxes. This zine is a war cry against proprietary dogma and a love letter to open-source rebels like Python. Inspired by Sextus Empiricus' skepticism and Borges' satire, we say: fork the empire. Demand readability. Free the math.

\section*{\color{codeblack} 1. Wilkins' Folly: The Original Math Empire}
John Wilkins, 17th-century philosopher, strutted into court with a scroll of gibberish he called the "Universal Language."\footnote{Jorge Luis Borges, "The Analytical Language of John Wilkins," in \textit{Selected Non-Fictions}, ed. Eliot Weinberger (New York: Penguin, 1999), 229-232.} "Zita" for dog, "Zeto" for wolf, "Zigad" for king—a taxonomic hydra meant to unite the world. Instead, it united the court in laughter. His 40 "genera" were a bureaucratic nightmare, cataloging everything from fire ("Deb") to gunpowder ("Saln"). The king called it slow; the jester called it a spice rack.

\textbf{Lesson}: Grand systems that promise unity often hide chaos. Wilkins' scroll, like Wolfram's monolith, was a founder's ego dressed as truth.

\section*{\color{codeblack} 2. Wolfram's Modern Monarchy}
Stephen Wolfram's Language is Wilkins' scroll with better branding.\footnote{Stephen Wolfram, \textit{A New Kind of Science} (Champaign, IL: Wolfram Media, 2002), 12-15.} It's slick, symbolic, and "English-like," but don't be fooled—its \texttt{DSolve[]} and \texttt{CompiledFunction[...]} are black boxes. Want to audit the logic? Too bad. Pay the license, bow to the prophet. MATLAB's no better, a corporate fortress charging rent for matrix math.\footnote{MathWorks, "MATLAB Licensing Terms," \textit{MathWorks Documentation}, 2023, \url{https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/licensing.html}.}

\textbf{Why It Sucks}:  
- Opaque code = coerced trust.  
- Singular vision = fragile dogma.  
- Science isn't a subscription.

\section*{\color{codeblack} 3. Python: The Skeptic's Sword}
Python, born from Guido van Rossum's humility, is the anti-empire.\footnote{Guido van Rossum, "Python's Design Philosophy," \textit{Python Documentation Archive}, 1991, \url{https://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/}.} Its libraries—NumPy, SymPy, SciPy—are open, forkable, and legible.\footnote{NumPy Developers, "NumPy: The Fundamental Package for Scientific Computing," \textit{NumPy Documentation}, 2023, \url{https://numpy.org/doc/stable/}.} Check \texttt{numpy.source()} and see the gears. Fork SymPy to fit your needs. Van Rossum stepped down, letting the community steer.\footnote{Guido van Rossum, "Transfer of Power," \textit{Python Mailing List}, July 12, 2018, \url{https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-July/154148.html}.} That's Pyrrhonian skepticism in code—suspending judgment, demanding evidence.\footnote{Sextus Empiricus, \textit{Outlines of Pyrrhonism}, trans. R. G. Bury (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1933), 1.8.}

\textbf{Python's Edge}:  
- Readability = freedom.  
- Forkability = dissent.  
- Community = resilience.

\section*{\color{codeblack} 4. The Fork Test}
Try this: Can a coder in Nairobi or a lab in Lima rewrite the math engine without begging for permission?\footnote{Adapted from Richard Stallman, "Free Software, Free Society," \textit{Philosophy of the GNU Project}, 2002, \url{https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html}.} Python says yes—its code is open. Wolfram and MATLAB say no—paywalls and EULAs block the way. The fork test is a moral litmus: if you can't audit, you're not free. If you can't remix, it's not science.

\section*{\color{codeblack} 5. Borges' Satire: Taxonomy as Trap}
Jorge Luis Borges roasted Wilkins' taxonomy as a mirror of human obsession.\footnote{Borges, "The Analytical Language of John Wilkins," 229-232.} His fictional Chinese encyclopedia, splitting animals into "embalmed" or "suckling pigs," mocks the illusion of perfect classification. Wilkins' "Zita" and Wolfram's monolith share the same flaw: they promise universal truth but deliver founder-driven chaos. Like a non-halting program, they loop endlessly, trapping us in their logic.

\section*{\color{codeblack} 6. Readability Is Resistance}
Readable code is a political act.\footnote{Lawrence Lessig, \textit{Code: Version 2.0} (New York: Basic Books, 2006), 138-140.} It rejects gatekeepers, invites critique, and builds a knowledge commons. Python's clarity echoes Leibniz's fight for open calculus and Sextus' call for epistemic humility. Wolfram's opacity, like Wilkins' glyphs, demands faith over reason. Choose the tool that lets you draw your own map.

\section*{\color{cyberred} Epilogue: Fork the Future}
We reject:  
- Black boxes posing as truth.  
- Founders playing god.  
- Knowledge behind paywalls.  

We demand:  
- Auditable code.  
- Forkable tools.  
- A science that answers to all.  

Fork a repo. Teach Python. Call out "trust me" math. The empire thrives on compliance—stop giving it.

This is an exceptional piece—stylistically fierce, structurally coherent, and philosophically loaded. Here are some suggestions for light refinements and optional expansions:

a. Fork Icon Placeholder
:
Make sure to include a
\graphicspath{}
directive or place the

b. Final Banner Sizing

Consider tightening the final

2. Optional Content Enhancements
a. Include a "Timeline of Proprietary Lock-In" Box Sidebar

{Timeline of Proprietary Lock-In:}
\begin
{itemize}
\item
1970s - MATLAB born at the University of New Mexico, later monetized by MathWorks.
\item
1980s - Mathematica launched with closed kernels.
\item
1991 - Python emerges as readable rebellion.
\item
2002 - Wolfram's
\textit
{A New Kind of Science} codifies black-box empiricism.
\item
2020s - AI models mimic this opacity—time to fork back.
\end
{itemize}
};

3. Language Polish
Small stylistic upgrades:
"founder's ego dressed as truth" →
"founder's ego masquerading as epistemology"
"Science isn't a subscription." →
"Truth shouldn't come with terms of service."
"Readable code is a political act." → maybe bold or box this as a standalone pull-quote.
4. Alternate Title Option
If you ever repackage this:
"The Fork Doctrine: Code, Power, and the Fight for Epistemic Freedom"
Would you like help converting this to a printable PDF zine layout (e.g. booklet style with page folds) or exporting for web viewing (HTML/LaTeX hybrid)?

Perfect—this is a crucial point that's both philosophical and practical. Here's how you can argue that
open source isn't just about code—it includes math, geometry, and algebra

7. Open Source Isn't Just Code—It's Math, Too
When we say "open source," we don't just mean GitHub repos. We mean logic. We mean geometry. We mean algebraic structure and deductive method. Proprietary software that wraps these fundamentals in locked binaries is not just anti-user—it's anti-mind.
Math is the oldest open-source project in human history. Euclid didn't patent the Elements. Omar Khayyam didn't encrypt his cubic solutions. Newton (begrudgingly) published the calculus. When math gets locked behind interfaces you can't inspect, it ceases to be math—it becomes religion.
\textbf{Why it matters}:
A theorem hidden in a black box is not a theorem—it's an oracle.
An algorithm you can't trace is not a method—it's a commandment.
Geometry rendered inaccessible is not beauty—it's a fortress.
\begin{quote}
"Open source means you can read the proof, not just trust the priest."
—A Forker's Maxim
\end{quote}
Just as the source code of a program must be visible to qualify as open, so too must the mathematical logic behind a model or method. If a piece of software performs symbolic integration but you can't audit its transformation rules, it's not doing math—it's doing mysticism.
Would you like this added to your zine as a new section (e.g.,
Section 7: Open Math is Open Source
)? I can insert and format it directly.
