Preface
First Edition
This text is an introduction to algebra for undergraduates who are interested in
careers which require a strong background in mathematics. It will benefit stu-
dents studying computer science and physical sciences, who plan to teach math-
ematics in schools, or to work in industry or finance. The book assumes that
the reader has a solid background in linear algebra. For the first 12 chapters el-
ementary operations, elementary matrices, linear independence and rank are im-
portant. In the second half of the book abstract vector spaces are used. Students
will need to have experience proving results. Some acquaintance with Euclidean
geometry is also desirable. In fact I have found that a course in Euclidean geom-
etry fits together very well with the algebra in the first 12 chapters. But one can
avoid the geometry in the book by simply omitting chapter 7 and the geometric
parts of chapters 9 and 18.
The material in the book is organized linearly. There are few excursions away
from the main path. The only significant parts which can be omitted are those
just mentioned, the section in chapter 12 on PSL(2, Fp), chapter 13 on abelian
groups and the section in chapter 14 on Berlekamp's algorithm.
The first chapter is meant as an introduction. It discusses congruences and
the integers modulo n. Chapters 3 and 4 introduce permutation groups and linear
groups, preparing for the definition of abstract groups in chapter 5. Chapters 8
and 9 are devoted to group actions. Lagrange's theorem comes in chapter 10 as

PREFACE
an application. The Sylow theorems in chapter 11 are proved following Wielandt
via group actions as well. In chapter 13, row and column reduction of integer
matrices is used to prove the classification theorem for finitely generated abelian
groups. Chapter 14 collects all the results about polynomial rings in one variable
over a field that are needed for Galois theory. I have followed the standard Artin
- van der Waerden approach to Galois theory. But I have tried to show where
it comes from by introducing the Galois group of a polynomial as its symmetry
group, that is the group of permutations of its roots which preserves algebraic
relations among them. Chapters 18, 19, 20 and 21 are applications of Galois
theory. In chapter 20 I have chosen to prove only that the general equation
of degree 5 or greater cannot be solved by taking roots. The correspondence
between radical extensions and solvable Galois groups I have found is often too
sophisticated for undergraduates.
This book also tries to show students how software can be used intelligently in
algebra. I feel that this is particularly important for the intended audience. There
is a delicate philosophical point. Does a software calculation prove anything?
This is not a simple question, and there does not seem to be a consensus among
mathematicians about it. There are a few places in the text where a calculation
does rely on software, for example, in calculating the Sylow 2-subgroups of S8.
The Mathematica notebooks corresponding to the software sections are available
at the book's web site, as are the equivalent Maple worksheets.
Some of the exercises are referred to later in the text. These have been marked
with a bullet • . There are exercises where the software is useful but not essential,
and some where it is essential. However, I have deliberately not tried to indicate
which ones these are. Learning to decide when software is useful and when not,
seems to me to be an important part of learning to use it.
I am grateful to many people for help with this book at various stages, in
particular to Edward Bierstone, Imtiaz Manji, David Milne, Kumar Murty, Joe
Repka and Paul Selick. In discussions over the years, Ragnar Buchweitz has made
many suggestions about teaching undergraduate algebra, for which I am most
thankful. The section on quartics and the associated pencil of conics is one of

several topics in the book suggested by him. The software was originally written
with the help of George Beck, Keldon Drudge and Petra Menz. The present
version is due to David Milne. The software which produced the pictures of the
Platonic solids in chapter 7 was also written by George Beck.

PREFACE
Introduction
The first part of this book is an introduction to group theory. It begins with a
study of permutation groups in chapter 3. Historically this was one of the starting
points of group theory. In fact it was in the context of permutations of the roots
of a polynomial that they first appeared (see 7.4). A second starting point was
the study of linear groups, i.e. groups of matrices, introduced in chapter 4. These
appeared as groups of transformations which preserve different geometries, such
as Euclidean spaces, the hyperbolic plane (see 8.8) or projective spaces. They also
arose as symmetry groups of objects like regular polygons or platonic solids in
in Euclidean space, discussed in chapter 7, or of tessellations of the Euclidean
or hyperbolic plane. The algebra underlying these special types of groups can be
unified in the concept of the abstract group. This is introduced in chapter 5.

1
Congruences
This is an introductory chapter. The main topic is the arithmetic of congruences,
sometimes called 'clock arithmetic'. It leads to the construction of the integers
modulo n. These are among the simplest examples of groups, as we shall see
in chapter 5. If n is a prime number, then the integers modulo n form a field.
In chapter 4, we will be looking at matrices with entries in these fields. As an
application of congruences we also discuss divisibility tests. In order to be able to
solve linear congruences we review greatest common divisors and the Euclidean
algorithm.
1.1
Basic Properties
Definition 1.1. Fix a natural number n. The integers a and b are congruent
modulo n or mod n, written
a ≡b
(mod n) ,
if a −b is divisible by n.
For example,
23 ≡1
(mod 11)
23 ≡2
(mod 7)
23 ≡−2
(mod 25)

CHAPTER 1. CONGRUENCES
If you measure time with a 12-hour clock, then you are calculating the hour mod-
ulo 12. For example, 5 hours after 9 o'clock is not 14 o'clock but 2 o'clock. We
keep track of the days by reckoning modulo 7. If today is a Wednesday, then 10
days from today will be a Saturday. January 19 was a Wednesday in the year 2000.
To determine what day of the week it was in 1998, we can calculate
2 · 365 = 730 ≡2
(mod 7) .
Therefore January 19 was a Friday in 1998. Calculating modulo n is very similar
to calculating in the integers. First we note that congruence modulo n is an
equivalence relation.
Theorem 1.2.
(i) a ≡a (mod n) ;
(ii) if a ≡b (mod n) then b ≡a (mod n) ;
(iii) if a ≡b (mod n) and b ≡c (mod n) , then a ≡c (mod n).
It is easy to see why this is true. Clearly a −a = 0 is divisible by n. If a −b
is divisible by n then so is b −a = −(a −b). And lastly, if a −b and b −c are
divisible by n, then so is a −c = (a −b) + (b −c).
Any integer a is congruent to a unique integer r , 0 ≤r ≤n −1. Simply
divide a by n:
a = qn + r,
for some q and r , 0 ≤r < n.
Then a ≡r (mod n). From this you see that a is also congruent to a unique
integer between 1 and n, or between −57 and n−58. Addition and multiplication
make sense modulo n:
Theorem 1.3.
(i) if a ≡b (mod n) , and c ≡d (mod n) then a + c ≡b + d
(mod n);
(ii) if a ≡b (mod n) , and c ≡d (mod n) then ac ≡bd (mod n);
Proof. Well, since b−a and d−c are divisible by n then so are (b+d)−(a+c) =
(b −a) + (d −c) and bd −ac = bd −bc + bc −ac = b(d −c) + c(b −a).

1.2. DIVISIBILITY TESTS

1.2
Divisibility Tests
With these simple properties we can establish some divisibility tests for natural
numbers. Let's begin by deducing the obvious tests for divisibility by 2 and 5
using congruences. Suppose a is a natural number given in decimal form by
a = ak · · · a1a0 , in other words
a = ak10k + · · · + a110 + a0
with 0 ≤aj < 10 for all j. Then since 10j ≡0 (mod 2) for any j,
a ≡a0
(mod 2) .
So a is even if and only if its last digit a0 is even. Similarly 10j ≡0 (mod 5) so
that
a ≡a0
(mod 5) .
Thus a is divisible by 5 if and only if a0 is, which is the case precisely when a0 is
0 or 5. Next let's look at divisibility by 3 and 9.
Test 1.4. Divisibility by 3 or 9
(i) A natural number a is divisible by 3 if  and only if  the sum of  its digits is divisible
by 3.
(ii) A natural number a is divisible by 9 if  and only if  the sum of  its digits is divisible
by 9.
Proof. We have for k > 0,
xk −1 = (x −1)(xk−1 + · · · + x + 1) .
Taking x = 10, we see that 10k −1 is divisible by 9 and in particular by 3. So
10k ≡1
(mod 9)
and
10k ≡1
(mod 3).
Therefore if
a = ak10k + · · · + a110 + a0 ,

6
CHAPTER 1. CONGRUENCES
then
a ≡ak + · · · + a1 + a0
(mod 9)
and
a ≡ak + · · · + a1 + a0
(mod 3) .
So a is divisible by 9, respectively 3, if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible
by 9, respectively 3.
There is a test for divisibility by 11 which is similar. It is discussed in exercise
5. The tests for divisibility by 7 and 13 are more subtle. Here is the test for 7.
The test for 13 is in exercise 6.
Test 1.5. Divisibility by 7
Let a be a natural number. Write a = 10b + a0, where 0 ≤a0 < 10. Then a is
divisible by 7 if  and only if b −2a0 is divisible by 7.
Proof. We have
10b + a0 ≡0
(mod 7)
if and only if
10b + a0 ≡21a0
(mod 7)
since 21a0 ≡0 (mod 7) . Equivalently,
10b −20a0 ≡0
(mod 7) ,
i.e. 7 divides 10b −20a0 = 10(b −2a0) . Since 10 is not divisible by 7, this
holds if and only if 7 divides b −2a0. In other words,
b −2a0 ≡0
(mod 7) .
For example,
426537183 ≡39 ≡0
(mod 3) , but
426537183 ≡39 ≡3
(mod 9) .
So 426537183 is divisible by 3 but not by 9. And
98 = 9 · 10 + 8 ≡0
(mod 7)
since
9 −2 · 8 = −7 ≡0
(mod 7) .

There is another divisibility question with a pretty answer. When does a nat-
ural number n divide 10k −1 for some k > 0 ? Not surprisingly this is related to
the decimal expansion of 1/n. First remember that every rational number m/n
has a repeating decimal expansion (see [1], §6.1). This expansion is finite if and
only the prime factors of the denominator n are 2 and 5. Otherwise it is infinite.
If n divides 10k −1, then the expansion of 1/n is of a special form. Suppose
that
na = 10k −1 ,
a ∈N .
Write out the decimal expansion of a:
a = a110k−1 + · · · + ak−110 + ak .
So
a110k−1 + · · · + ak−110 + ak = 10k
n −1
n .
Divide this equation by 10k:
0.a1 . . . ak−1ak = 1
n −10−k

The sums converge because the series on the right is a geometric series. The sum
in the middle telescopes, leaving 1/n, and the left hand side is a repeating decimal
fraction. So
1
n = 0.a1 . . . aka1 . . . aka1 . . . .
(1.1)
Conversely, it is easy to show that if 1/n has a decimal expansion of this form,
then n divides 10k −1. The shortest such sequence of numbers a1, . . . , ak is
called the period of 1/n and k the length of the period. If we have any other
expansion for 1/n,
1
n = 0.b1 . . . blb1 . . . blb1 . . . ,
for some b1, . . . , bl, then we see that l must be a multiple of the period. So the
answer to our original question is:
Theorem 1.6.
10k −1 ≡0
(mod n)
if  and only if 1/n has a decimal expansion of  the form (1.1) and k is a multiple of  the length
of  the period of 1/n.

1.3. COMMON DIVISORS

Taking n = 7, we can calculate that
1
7 = 0.142857142857 . . . .
So 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7 is the period of 1/7, which has length 6. Then 106−1 = 999999
is divisible by 7, and for no smaller k is 10k −1 divisible by 7.
1.3
Common Divisors
Recall that d is a common divisor of two integers a and b (not both 0) if d divides a
and d divides b. The greatest common divisor is the largest one and is written (a, b).
Every common divisor of a and b divides the greatest common divisor. We can
compute (a, b) by the Euclidean algorithm. We divide a by b with a remainder r.
Then we divide b by r with a remainder r1, and so on until we get a remainder 0.
a = qb + r
0 ≤r < b
b = q1r + r1
0 ≤r1 < r
...
...
ri−1 = qi+1ri + ri+1
0 ≤ri+1 < ri
...
...
rn−2 = qnrn−1 + rn
0 ≤rn < rn−1
rn−1 = qn+1rn
In chapter 14 we shall see the same algorithm for polynomials.
The reason that this algorithm computes (a, b) is the following:
Lemma 1.7. Let u and v be integers, not both 0. Write
u = qv + r ,
for some integers q and r with 0 ≤r < |v|. Then
(u, v) = (v, r) .

10
CHAPTER 1. CONGRUENCES
Proof. If d is a common divisor of u and v, then d divides r = u −qv and is
therefore a common divisor of v and r. Conversely, if d is a common divisor of
v and r, then d divides u = qv + r and is therefore a common divisor of u and
v. So the greatest common divisor of the two pairs must be the same.
Applying this to the list of divisions above we obtain
(ri−1, ri) = (ri, ri+1)
for each i < n. Now the last equation says that rn | rn−1. This means that
(rn−1, rn) = rn .
Therefore arguing by induction,
(ri−1, ri) = rn
for all i, in particular
(a, b) = rn .
The proof of the lemma also shows that any common divisor of a and b divides
(a, b).
We can read more out of the list of equations. The first equation tells us that r
is a linear combination of a and b. The second one, that r1 is a linear combination
of b and r, and therefore of a and b. The third, that r2 is a linear combination of
r1 and r, and therefore of a and b. Continuing like this, we get that rn is a linear
combination of a and b. Thus there exist integers s and t such that
(a, b) = sa + tb .
Example 1.8. Take a = 57 and b = 21. Then
57 = 2 · 21 + 15
21 = 15 + 6
15 = 2 · 6 + 3
6 = 2 · 3 .

1.3. COMMON DIVISORS
11
Therefore
3 = (57, 21) .
Furthermore
15 = 57 −2 · 21
6 = 21 −15 = −57 + 3 · 21
3 = 15 −2 · 6 = 3 · 57 −8 · 21 .
So we can take s = 3 and t = −8.
△
Another way to look at the Euclidean algorithm is as an algorithm which
expresses the rational number a/b as a continued fraction. We have
a
b = q + r
b = q +
1
(
b
r
) .
But

so
a
b = q +

Continuing like this, our list of equations gives us the continued fraction

For more about the origins of the Euclidean algorithm, and its connection with
the rational approximation of real numbers, see [2]. To read more about contin-
ued fractions in number theory, see [1].
Returning to the greatest common divisor, we say that a and b are relatively
prime if (a, b) = 1, that is, if they have no common divisors except ±1. Thus, if
a and b are relatively prime, there exist integers s and t such that
1 = sa + tb .
For example, 16 and 35 are relatively prime and
1 = −5 · 35 + 11 · 16 .
Related to the greatest common divisor of two integers is their least common
multiple. The least common multiple m of a, b ∈Z is the smallest common
multiple of a and b, i.e. the smallest natural number which is divisible by both a
and b. We shall write
m = lcm(a, b) .
It is not hard to see that m divides every common multiple of a and b, and that
ab
(a, b) = lcm(a, b).
In example 1.8 above,
lcm(57, 21) = 57 · 21/3 = 399 .

1.4. SOLVING CONGRUENCES
13
1.4
Solving Congruences
It is very useful to be able to solve linear congruences, just the way you solve
linear equations.
Theorem 1.9. If (a, n) = 1, then the congruence
ax ≡b
(mod n)
has a solution which is unique modulo n.
Proof. Write 1 = as + nt for some integers s and t. Then b = bas + bnt. Thus
b ≡abs
(mod n)
and x = bs is a solution of the congruence. If we have two solutions x and y
then ax ≡ay (mod n) i.e. n divides ax −ay = a(x −y). Since a and n are
relatively prime, this means that n divides x −y. Thus x ≡y (mod n).
Example 1.10. Let's solve the congruence
24x ≡23
(mod 31) .
First we use the Euclidean algorithm to find integers s and t such that 24s+31t =
1. One such pair is s = −9 and t = 7. Then
23 = 24(23s) + 31(23t)
so that
24(23s) ≡23
(mod 31) .
Thus x = −207 ≡10 (mod 31) is a solution of the congruence. We could
also just compute multiples of 24 modulo 31.
△
In particular the congruence ax ≡1 (mod n) has a solution, unique modulo
n,
if (a, n) = 1. For example, if a = 7 and n = 36, then 5 · 7 ≡−1 (mod 36).
So −5 ≡31 (mod 36) is a solution of 7x ≡1 (mod 36).

14
CHAPTER 1. CONGRUENCES
Remark 1.11. If n is prime, then all a with a ̸≡0 (mod n) are relatively prime
to n and have 'multiplicative inverses' mod n.
Notice however that
9x ≡1
(mod 36)
does not have a solution. For if such an x did exist we could multiply the con-
gruence by 4 and get
0 ≡4 · 9x ≡4
(mod 36) .
But 0 −4 is not divisible by 36. In fact it is true in general, that if a and n are
not relatively prime, then
ax ≡1
(mod n)
does not have a solution. For suppose that a = a′d and n = n′d with d > 1.
Then n′a = n′a′d ≡0 (mod n) so that
0 ≡n′ax ≡n′ ̸≡0
(mod n) .
Therefore no such x can exist.
In general we let φ(n) denote the number of integers a, 0 < a ≤n, which
are relatively prime to n. For example if p is prime then φ(p) = p −1.
Later we will also need to solve simultaneous congruences. The result which
tells us that this is possible is called the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
Theorem 1.12. If n1 and n2 are relatively prime, then the two congruences
x ≡b1
(mod n1)
and
x ≡b2
(mod n2)
have a common solution which is unique modulo n1n2.
Proof. A solution of the first congruence has the form b1 + sn1. For this to be a
solution of the second congruence, we must have that
b1 + sn1 ≡b2
(mod n2)
or equivalently
n1s ≡b2 −b1
(mod n2) .

1.5. THE INTEGERS MODULO N
15
Since (n1, n2) = 1, the previous theorem assures us that such an s exists. If x
and y are two solutions, then x ≡y (mod n1) and x ≡y (mod n2), i.e. x −y
is divisible by n1 and by n2. As n1 and n2 are relatively prime, x −y must be
divisible by n1n2. Thus x ≡y (mod n1n2).
Example 1.13. Solve
x ≡14
(mod 24)
x ≡6
(mod 31)
.
Solutions of the first congruence are of the form 14+24s. So we must solve
14 + 24s ≡6
(mod 31)
or equivalently
24s ≡23
(mod 31) .
This is the congruence we solved in example 1.10. We saw that s = 10 is a
solution. Therefore x = 254 as a solution of the two congruences we began
with.
△
1.5
The Integers Modulo n
As pointed out in theorem 1.2, congruence modulo n is an equivalence relation.
The equivalence classes are called congruence classes. The congruence class of
an integer a is
¯a := a + nZ := {a + sn | s ∈Z}
The set of all congruences classes is denoted by Z/nZ and called the set of integers
modulo n. Since every integer a is congruent to a unique r satisfying 0 ≤r < n,
¯a contains a unique r, 0 ≤r < n. Thus there is a one-to-one correspondence

16
CHAPTER 1. CONGRUENCES
between Z/nZ and {0, 1, . . . , n −1}. For example, in Z/2Z there are two
congruence classes:
0 + 2Z = {2s | s ∈Z},
the even integers, and
1 + 2Z = {1 + 2s | s ∈Z},
the odd integers. We can define addition on Z/nZ by
¯a + ¯b = a + b .
Because of theorem 1.2 this makes sense. You can think of this as adding two
natural numbers a and b in {0, 1, . . . , n −1} modulo n, i.e., their sum is the
remainder after division of a + b by n. This addition in Z/nZ is associative and
commutative:
(¯a + ¯b) + ¯c = ¯a + (¯b + ¯c)
¯a + ¯b = ¯b + ¯a .
And
¯a + ¯0 = ¯0
¯a + (−a) = ¯0 .
For example, in Z/10Z,
¯5 + ¯7 = ¯2 , ¯4 + ¯6 = ¯0 .
Multiplication can also be defined on Z/nZ:
¯a · ¯b := ab .
As with addition we can think of this as just multiplication modulo n for two
numbers from {0, 1, . . . , n −1}. It too is associative and commutative, and ¯1
is the identity element. If (a, n) = 1 then as pointed out in remark 1.6, ¯a has a

1.5. THE INTEGERS MODULO N
17
multiplicative inverse. For example, we checked that in Z/36Z the multiplicative
inverse of ¯7 is 31. We also saw that because ¯4 · ¯9 = ¯0 , ¯9 has no multiplicative
inverse.
We have seen that Z/nZ, at least when n is prime, has many formal properties
in common with the set of real numbers R and complex numbers C. We can
collect these properties in a formal definition.
Definition 1.14. A field F is a set with two binary operations, called 'addition'
and 'multiplication', written + and · respectively, with the following properties (a
binary operation on F is just a mapping F × F →F):
(i) Addition and multiplication are both associative and commutative;
(ii) For a, b, c ∈F, a(b + c) = ab + ac ;
(iii) There exist distinct elements 0, 1 ∈F such that for any a ∈F,
a + 0 = a
a · 1 = a .
(iv) For any a ∈F there exists a unique element, written −a, such that
a + (−a) = 0,
and for any a ∈F, a ̸= 0, there exists a unique element, written a−1, such
that
a · a−1 = 1.
These are the formal properties satisfied by addition and multiplication in R
and C, as well as in Z/pZ for p prime. We introduce the notation Fp for Z/pZ.
As pointed out above, if n is not prime, then not all non-zero elements in Z/nZ
have multiplicative inverses, so that in these cases Z/nZ is not a field.

Introduction to Software
The main purpose of this section is to give you a chance to practice using Math-
ematica. It has several functions which are relevant to this section. For making
computations in the integers modulo n there is a built-in function Mod. Thus
In[1]:= Mod[25+87,13]
Out[1]= 8
and
In[2]:= Mod[2^12,7]
Out[2]= 1
A more efficient way of computing powers mod n is to use the function PowerMod:
In[3]:= PowerMod[2,12,7]
Out[3]= 1
For any real number a the function N[a, m] will compute the first m digits
of a. For example,
In[4]:= N[1/7, 20]
Out[4]= 0.14285714285714285714
So we see that the period of 1/7 is 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7 , as discussed above. Similarly
In[5]:= N[1/19, 40]

1.6. INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE
19
Out[5]= 0.0526315789473684210526315789473684210526
Thus the period of 1/19 is 0, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4, 2, 1 , which
has length 18. And
In[6]:= Mod[10^18 - 1, 19]
Out[6]= 0
but for smaller k, 10k −1 ̸≡0 (mod 19). We can do these calculations for all
the primes less than 30 say, and tabulate the results. They confirm theorem 1.6.

Similarly,

Out[7]= 0
What do you think is going on? Experiment a bit and try to make a conjecture.
Given a pair of integers a and b, the function ExtendedGCD will compute
(a, b) and integers s and t such that (a, b) = as + bt . For example,

20
CHAPTER 1. CONGRUENCES
In[8]:= ExtendedGCD[57, 21]
Out[8]= {3,{3,-8}}
This means that 3 = 3 · 57 −8 · 21. If we want to find the multiplicative inverse
of 105 in F197, we can enter
In[9]:= ExtendedGCD[105, 197]
Out[9]= {1,{-15,8}}
So 1 = −15 · 105 + 8 · 197 and −15 = 182 is the multiplicative inverse of 105.
There is a function called ChineseRemainder which will solve two such
congruences simultaneously. In fact it will solve a system:
x ≡b1
(mod n1)
...
x ≡br
(mod nr)
Simply enter
In[10]:= ChineseRemainder[{b1, ... , br},{n1, ...
, nr}]
So in our example:
In[11]:= ChineseRemainder[{14, 6},{24, 31}]
Out[11]= 254

Permutations
2.1
Permutations as Mappings
In the next chapter, we will begin looking at groups by studying permutation
groups. To do this we must first establish the properties of permutations that we
shall need there. A permutation of a set X is a rearrangement of the elements of
X. More precisely
Definition 2.1. A permutation of a set X is a bijective mapping of X to itself.
A bijective mapping is a mapping that is one-to-one and onto. We are mainly
interested in permutations of finite sets, in particular of the sets {1, 2, . . . , n}
where n is a natural number. A convenient way of writing such a permutation α
is the following. Write down the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n in a row and write down
their images under α in a row beneath:
( 1
2
. . .
n
α(1)
α(2)
. . .
α(n)
)
.
For example, the permutation α of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} with α(1) = 3, α(2) =
1, α(3) = 5, α(4) = 2, and α(5) = 4 is written
α =

We denote by SX the set of all permutations of a set X, and by Sn the set of
permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n}. It is easy to count the number of permutations
in Sn. A permutation can map 1 to any of 1, 2, . . . , n. Having chosen the image
of 1, 2 can be mapped to any of the remaining n −1 numbers. Having chosen
the images of 1 and 2, 3 can be mapped to any of the remaining n −2 numbers.
And so on, until the images of 1, . . . , n −1 have been chosen. The remaining
number must be the image of n. So there are n(n −1)(n −2) · · · 1 choices.
Thus Sn has n! elements.
If we are given two permutations α and β of a set X then the composition
α ◦β is also one-to-one and onto. So it too is a permutation of the elements of
X. For example, if α is the element of S5 above, and
β =
(1
2
3
4
5
2
3
5
1
4
)
,
then
α ◦β =
(1
2
3
4
5
1
5
4
3
2
)
.
The entries in the second row are just (α ◦β)(1), . . . , (α ◦β)(5). Notice that
β ◦α =
(1
2
3
4
5
5
2
4
3
1
)
̸= α ◦β .
The order in which you compose permutations matters.
Since a permutation is bijective, it has an inverse which is also a bijective
mapping. The inverse of the element β ∈S5 above is
β−1 =
(1
2
3
4
5
4
1
2
5
3
)
.
To compute the entries in the second row, find the number which β maps to 1,
to 2, etc. You can quickly check that
β−1 ◦β = β ◦β−1 =
(1
2
3
4
5
1
2
3
4
5
)
,
which is the identity permutation.

2.2. CYCLES
27
From now on, for convenience, we are going to write the composition of two
permutations α and β as a 'product':
αβ := α ◦β .
So to calculate (αβ)(i), we first apply β to i and then apply α to the result. In
other words, we read products 'from right to left'.
2.2
Cycles
Let
α =
(1
2
3
4
5
3
2
4
1
5
)
∈S5.
So α(1) = 3, α(3) = 4, α(4) = 1 and α fixes 2 and 5. We say that α permutes 1,
3, and 4 cyclically and that α is a cycle or more precisely, a 3-cycle. In general, an
element α ∈Sn is an r-cycle, where r ≤n, if there is a sequence i1, i2, . . . , ir ∈
{1, . . . , n} of distinct numbers, such that
α(i1) = i2, α(i2) = i3, . . . , α(ir−1) = ir, α(ir) = i1,
and α fixes all other elements of {1, . . . , n}.
Cycles are particularly simple. We shall show that any permutation can be
written as a product of cycles, in fact there is even a simple algorithm which does
this. Let's first carry it out in an example. Take
α =
(1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
2
4
5
1
3
8
6
7
)
.
We begin by looking at α(1), α2(1), . . . . We have
α(1) = 2, α(2) = 4, α(4) = 1.
As our first cycle α1 then, we take the 3-cycle
α1 =
(1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
2
4
3
1
5
6
7
8
)
.

28
CHAPTER 2. PERMUTATIONS
The smallest number which does not occur in this cycle is 3. We see that
α(3) = 5, α(5) = 3.
So take as our second cycle, the 2-cycle
α2 =
(1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
1
2
5
4
3
6
7
8
)
.
The smallest number which is left fixed by α1 and α2 is 6. Now
α(6) = 8, α(8) = 7, α(7) = 6.
So let
α3 =
(1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
1
2
3
4
5
8
6
7
)
,
The numbers {1, 2, . . . , 8} are all accounted for now, and we see that
α = α3α2α1 .
The cycles are even disjoint, that is, no two have a number in common. This
works in general:
Theorem 2.2. Any permutation is a product of  disjoint cycles.
To see this, let α ∈Sn. Consider α(1), α2(1), . . . . At some point this
sequence will begin to repeat itself. Suppose that αt(1) = αs(1) where s < t.
Then αt−s(1) = 1. Pick the smallest r1 > 0 such that αr1(1) = 1. Let α1 be
the r1-cycle given by the sequence
1, α(1), α2(1), . . . , αr1−1(1)
Now pick the smallest number i2 ̸= αi(1) for any i. Consider α(i2), α2(i2), . . ..
Again pick the smallest r2 such that αr2(i2) = i2 and let α2 be the r2-cycle given
by the sequence
i2, α(i2), α2(i2), . . . , αr2−1(i2).

2.2. CYCLES
29
Continuing this way we find cycles α1, α2, . . . , αk such that
α = αk · · · α2α1 .
And these cycles are disjoint from one another.
At this point it is convenient to introduce cycle notation. If α ∈Sn is an r-cycle
then there exist i1, . . . , ir ∈{1, . . . , n} distinct from one another such that
α(ik) = ik+1 , for 1 ≤k < r , α(ir) = i1 , α(j) = j otherwise .
Then we write
α = (i1 i2 · · · ir) .
So in the example above,
α1 = (1 2 4) , α2 = (3 5) , α3 = (6 8 7) .
And in cycle notation, we write
α = (1 2 4)(3 5)(6 8 7) .
We do not write out 1-cycles, except with the identity permutation, which is writ-
ten (1) .
The order in which you write the cycles in a product of disjoint cycles does
not matter for the following reason:
Theorem 2.3. Disjoint cycles commute with each other.
To see this, suppose that α, β, ∈Sn are disjoint cycles given by
α = (i1 · · · ir) , β = (j1 · · · js) .
Then





α(β(j)) = j = β(α(j)),
for j /∈{i1, . . . , ir, j1, . . . , js},
α(β(ik)) = ik+1 = β(α(ik)),
for 1 ≤k ≤r,
α(β(jk)) = jk+1 = β(α(jk)),
for 1 ≤k ≤s.

30
CHAPTER 2. PERMUTATIONS
It is understood that ir+1 := i1 and js+1 := j1.
A 2-cycle is called a transposition. Any cycle can be written as a product of
transpositions. For example,
(1 2 3 4) = (1 4)(1 3)(1 2) .
or equally well,
(1 2 3 4) = (1 2)(2 4)(2 3) .
In general, if (i1 i2 · · · ir) ∈Sn, then
(i1 i2 · · · ir) = (i1 ir) · · · (i1 i3)(i1 i2) .
Combining this with the theorem above, we see that
Theorem 2.4. Any permutation can be written as a product of  transpositions.
For example
(1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
2
4
5
1
3
8
6
7
)
= (1 2 4)(3 5)(6 8 7) = (1 4)(1 2)(3 5)(6 7)(6 8) .
Actually this theorem is intuitively obvious. If you want to reorder a set of
objects, you naturally do it by switching pairs of them.
2.3
Sign of  a Permutation
In writing a permutation as a product of transpositions, the number of transpo-
sitions is not well-defined. For example,
(2 3)(1 2 3) = (2 3)(1 3)(1 2)
and
(2 3)(1 2 3) = (1 3) .

2.3. SIGN OF A PERMUTATION
31
However the parity of this number does turn out to be well-defined: the permu-
tation can be written as the product of an even number or an odd number of
transpositions, but not both.
To see this, let A be a real n × n matrix and α ∈Sn. Let Aα denote the
matrix obtained from A by permuting the rows according to α. So the first row
of Aα is the α(1)th row of A, the second row of Aα is the α(2)th row of A, and
so on. This is sometimes called a row operation on A. Recall that
Aα = IαA ,
where I is the identity matrix. In particular, taking A = Iβ,
(Iβ)α = IαIβ .
Now (Iβ)α = Iαβ (because we are reading products from right to left). So
Iαβ = IαIβ ,
and therefore
det(Iαβ) = det(Iα) det(Iβ) .
If α is a transposition, then
det(Iα) = −1 .
(Interchanging two rows of a determinant changes its sign.) So if α is the product
of r transpositions, then
det(Iα) = (−1)r .
The left hand side depends only on α and the right hand side only depends on
the parity of r.
We define the sign of α, written sgn α by
sgn α := det(Iα) .
A permutation α is even if sgn α is 1, i.e. if α can be written as a product of an
even number of transpositions, and odd if sgn α is −1. Thus the product of two
even permutations is even, of two odd ones even, and of an even one and an odd
one odd.

Definition
Suppose you have a square and number its vertices.
.

Each symmetry of the square permutes the vertices, and thus give you an element
of S4. We can make a table showing the 8 symmetries of the square and the
corresponding permutations:

(1 2 3 4)
rotation counterclockwise through π
(1 3)(2 4)

CHAPTER 3. PERMUTATION GROUPS
Let D4 ⊂S4 denote the set of permutations in the right-hand column,
D4 = {(1 2 3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4 3 2), (1), (2 4), (1 3), (1 2)(3 4), (1 4)(2 3)} .
Now the set of all symmetries of the square has the following two properties:
(i) the composition of two symmetries is a symmetry;
(ii) the inverse of a symmetry is a symmetry.
And it is easy to see that under the correspondence above, products map to
products. So the set D4 will have the same properties. You can also check this
directly. Sets of permutations with these algebraic properties are called permuta-
tion groups. As we shall see they arise in many contexts.
Definition 3.1. A non-empty set of permutations G ⊂Sn is called a permutation
group (of degree n) if for all α, β ∈G
(i)
αβ ∈G
(ii)
α−1 ∈G .
Sn itself is a permutation group, called the full permutation group (of degree n)
or symmetric group (of degree n). Another example is
V ′ = {(1 2), (3 4), (1 2)(3 4), (1)} ⊂S4 .
We see that
(1 2)(3 4) · (1 2) = (1 2) · (1 2)(3 4) = (3 4)
(1 2)(3 4) · (3 4) = (3 4) · (1 2)(3 4) = (1 2)
(3 4) · (1 2) = (1 2) · (3 4) = (1 2)(3 4)
(1 2)2 = (3 4)2 =
(
(1 2)(3 4)
)2 = (1)
(
(1 2)(3 4)
)−1 = (1 2)(3 4) , (1 2)−1 = (1 2) , (3 4)−1 = (3 4) .

3.2. CYCLIC GROUPS
37
So V ′ is a permutation group. With appropriate software it is easy to check
whether a set of permutations is a permutation group. This will be explained
below.
Let An ⊂Sn denote the set of all even permutations. In chapter 2, it was
pointed out that the product of two even permutations is even and that the inverse
of an even permutation is also even. Therefore An is a permutation group, called
the alternating group (of degree n). Of the 6 elements of S3, 3 are even: the two
3-cycles and the identity. Thus
A3 = {(1), (1 2 3), (1 3 2)}.
The number of elements in a permutation group G is called the order of G,
written |G|. Thus |Sn| = n!, |A3| = 3 and |V ′| = 4.
3.2
Cyclic Groups
There is a very simple class of permutation groups. You construct them in the fol-
lowing way. Take any α ∈Sn, for some n. Consider the powers of α: α, α2, . . ..
Since Sn is finite, at some point an element in this list will be repeated. Suppose
that
αt = αs, for some s < t.
Then multiplying both sides by α−s, we see that
αt−s = (1) .
Let r be the smallest natural number such that
αr = (1) .
Set
G = {(1), α, . . . , αr−1} ⊂Sn.
Now check that G is a permutation group: we have
(αi)−1 = α−i = αr−i
for any i, 1 ≤i < r.

38
CHAPTER 3. PERMUTATION GROUPS
and
αiαj = αi+j = αk,
where i + j ≡k
(mod r), 0 ≤k < r .
G is called the cyclic permutation group generated by α and will be denoted by
⟨α⟩. It has order r. As you can imagine there is a connection between a cyclic
permutation group of order r and the integers mod r. This will be made clear in
theorem 6.2.
Examples 3.2.
(i) Take α = (1 2). Since (1 2)2 = (1), {(1), (1 2)} is a cyclic permutation
group of order 2.
(ii) Take α = (1 2 3). Since (1 2 3)3 = (1) , and (1 2 3)2 = (1 3 2),
{(1), (1 2 3), (1 3 2)} is a cyclic permutation group of order 3. In fact this
group is the alternating group of degree 3, A3.
These examples suggest that the cyclic permutation group generated by an
r-cycle should have order r. Indeed, if
α = (i1 i2 · · · ir),
then αr = (1), but for j < r, αj(i1) = ij ̸= i1, so that αj ̸= (1). Therefore
the cyclic permutation group generated by α does have order r.
Definition 3.3. The order of a permutation α, written |α|, is the order of the
cyclic permutation group ⟨α⟩generated by α, or equivalently, the smallest r ∈N
such that αr = (1)
Remark 3.4. Suppose that αs = 1, for some s ∈N. Let r = |α|. Write s = qr+t,
for some q, t ∈Z where 0 ≤t < r. Then
(1) = αs = αqr+t = αt.
But then by the definition of |α| we must have t = 0. So r divides s.

3.3. GENERATORS
39
Example 3.5. Suppose we write α as a product of disjoint cycles,
α = α1α2 · · · αk
where αi is an ri-cycle. Suppose αs = 1, for some s. Since α1, α2, . . . , αk are
disjoint cycles, this implies that
αs
i = (1)
for all i, 1 ≤i ≤k. (Check this!) But then by the remark above, ri divides s for
all i. So s is a common multiple of these orders. And therefore the order of α is
the least common multiple of r1, r2, . . . , rk.
△
3.3
Generators
The group V ′ above is not cyclic. Each of its elements has order 2 except for the
identity. There is no element of order 4. However our calculation showed that if
we begin with (1 2) and (3 4) say, we can express the remaining two elements of
V ′ in terms of them. Similarly, in exercise 2.2 we saw that every element of S3
can be written in terms of (1 2) and (1 2 3). We say that V ′ or S3 is generated by
{(1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4)}, respectively {(1 2), (1 2 3)}. In general a permutation
group G is said to be generated by a subset g ⊂G if every element in G can be
written as a product of elements of g.
Theorem 2.4 tells us that the set of all transpositions generates Sn. This is
a relatively large set: there are
(n
2
)
transpositions in Sn. In fact the set of n −1
transpositions
g = {(1 2), (2 3), · · · , (n −1 n)}
will do. To see this we just need to convince ourselves that any transposition can
be expressed in terms of transpositions in g. Because every permutation can be
written in terms of transpositions, it follows then that every permutation can be

40
CHAPTER 3. PERMUTATION GROUPS
written in terms of elements of g. Well, take a transposition (i j), where i < j.
We have
(i j) = (j −1 j)(j −2 j −1) · · · (i i + 1) · · · (j −2 j −1)(j −1 j) .
But we can do even better than that. Just as in the case of S3, we can generate
Sn using just one transposition and one n-cycle. Let
α = (1 2)
,
β = (1 2 · · · n) .
Then for 1 < i < n,
(i i + 1) = βi−1αβ−i+1 = βi−1αβn−i+1 .
So every transposition in g and therefore every permutation can be written in
terms of α and β and thus {α, β} generates Sn.
In practice, it is very clumsy to describe a permutation group by listing all
its elements. In fact for a permutation group of any moderately large size it is
impossible -- try writing out all the elements of S10! A more convenient way is
to give a set of generators for it. So suppose we begin with a set of permutations
g ⊂Sn for some n. What do we mean by the permutation group G generated by g ?
In some sense G is the set of all permutations which can be expressed in terms
of elements of g. The following theorem makes this more precise.
Theorem 3.6. Let G be the smallest permutation group containing g. Then
G =
∞
∪
i=0
gi
The set gi is the set of all products of i elements of g, i.e.
gi = {α1α2 · · · αi | α1, α2, . . . , αi ∈g} .
Proof. Let H denote the right hand side. If G is a permutation group containing
g, then gi ⊂G for all i. So H is contained in any such G. We just need to

3.3. GENERATORS
41
convince ourselves that H is a permutation group. Well, the product of any two
elements in H lies in H. And if α ∈g, then as we saw in the previous section,
α−1 ∈gi for some i. But for any α1, . . . , αi ∈g, (α1 · · · αi)−1 = α−1
i
· · · α−1
1
(cf. exercise 2.3). So the inverse of any element in H also lies in H. Thus H is a
permutation group and therefore G = H.
Now we can make our definition:
Definition 3.7. The permutation group generated by a set of permutations g is
the smallest permutation group containing g or equivalently, the set of products
G =
∞
∪
i=0
gi .
For computational purposes this description is very inefficient. A simple
algorithm which allows one to compute the elements of the permutation group
generated by g, provided that the degree of g is small, is given in the exercises.
Example 3.8. Let's look at more permutation groups of degree 4. First there
are the cyclic permutation groups. In S4 there are five different types of per-
mutations: the identity, 2-cycles, 3-cycles, 4-cycles and products of two disjoint
2-cycles. The last have order 2. Non-cyclic groups that have already been men-
tioned are S4 itself and A4. There are also four copies of S3: take the full group
of permutations of any three of 1, 2, 3, 4. As well there is the permutation group
V ′ mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. Another permutation group of
order 4, which looks similar to V ′, is
V = {(1), (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)} .
All non-trivial elements have order 2 and any two of them generate V . Notice
that V ⊂A4. There is also a permutation group of order 8 called D4, generated
by {(1 2 3 4), (1 2)(3 4)}. This is in fact the permutation group corresponding
to the symmetries of a square, mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. There
are actually several copies of this permutation group, depending on the choice of
4-cycle you make.

Software and Calculations
The package 'Groups.m' can be used to make useful calculations in permutation
groups. To start, you must load it:
In[1]:= << Groups.m;
Next you have to know how our notation for permutations is implemented. In
this package, a permutation (in mapping notation) is given by the list of its images
with the header, M. For example
(1
2
3
4
5
6
2
4
1
6
3
5
)
is represented by
M[2,4,1,6,3,5]
You can name this permutation:
In[2]:= a = M[2,4,1,6,3,5]
Out[2]=
(1 2 3 4 5 6
2 4 1 6 3 5
)
If b is another permutation then the product ab is given by
a.b
For example if
In[3]:= b = M[4,2,3,6,1,5]
Out[3]=
(1 2 3 4 5 6
4 2 3 6 1 5
)

3.4. SOFTWARE AND CALCULATIONS
43
then entering
In[4]:= a.b
Out[4]=
(1 2 3 4 5 6
6 4 1 5 2 3
)
To find the inverse of a, enter
In[5]:= Inverse[a]
Out[5]=
(1 2 3 4 5 6
3 1 5 2 6 4
)
A permutation in cycle notation is written as the list of its cycles, which are in
turn lists, and is preceded by the header P. For example (1 2)(3 4 5) is represented
by
P[{1,2},{3,4,5}]
You can take products and inverses using cycle notation just as with mapping
notation:
In[6]:= P[{1,2},{3,4,5}].P[{1,2,3,4,5}]
Out[6]= (2 4 3 5)
In[7]:= Inverse[ P[{1,2},{3,4,5}] ]
Out[7]= (1 2)(3 5 4)

44
CHAPTER 3. PERMUTATION GROUPS
Output is in standard mathematical cycle notation.
You can apply these functions to lists of permutations. When you take the
product of two lists of permutations, the product of every permutation in the
first list with every one in the second will be computed: for example
In[8]:= {a,b}.{a,b}
Out[8]=
{ (1 2 3 4 5 6
2 6 4 5 3 1
)
,
(1 2 3 4 5 6
4 6 2 5 1 3
)
,
(1 2 3 4 5 6
6 2 3 5 4 1
)
,
(1 2 3 4 5 6
6 4 1 5 2 3
) }
These functions are useful for checking whether a set of permutations form a
group. For example let
In[9]:= G = {M[2,3,1,5,4], M[4,1,2,5,3], M[1,3,5,2,4],
M[2,1,3,4,5], M[1,2,3,4,5]}
Out[9]=

is not in the set G and therefore G is not a permutation group.
The function Group calculates the permutation group generated by a given
set of permutations. All computations take place in Sn where n is the largest
number occurring in the cycles in the input. The algorithm used is the one given
in exercise 3.8. For example, the permutation group G = ⟨(1 2 3 4 5), (1 2)(3 5)⟩
is given by
In[11]:= G = Group[ P[{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}] , P[{1,2},{3,5}]
]
Out[11]= ⟨(1 2 3 4 5), (1 2)(3 5) ⟩
To see a list of the elements in G, you use the function Elements:
In[12]:= Elements[G]
Out[12]= {(1), (1 2 3 4 5), (1 3 5 2 4), (1 4 2 5

(1 2)(3 5), (1 3)(4 5), (1 4)(2 3), (1

(2 5)(3 4)}
The function Generators will print out the generators of G again:
In[13]:= Generators[G]
Out[13]= {(1 2 3 4 5), (1 2)(3 5)}
The order of the permutation group is given by the function Order:

CHAPTER 3. PERMUTATION GROUPS
In[14]:= Order[G]
Out[14]= 10
We can verify by computation that (1 2) and (1 2 3 4 5 6) generate S6:
In[15]:= Order[ Group[ P[1,2], P[1,2,3,4,5,6] ] ]
Out[15]= 720
Since 6! = 720, they do generate S6.
Let's look for generators of A4, which is also not cyclic. We know that the
even permutations of degree 4 are the 3-cycles, the products of two disjoint trans-
positions and the identity. We first try two 3-cycles:
In[16]:= Order[ Group[ P[{1,2,3}], P[{2,3,4}] ] ]
Out[16]= 12
It is not hard to show that the order of An is n!/2 (see exercise 11). Therefore the
two 3-cycles do generate A4. How about a 3-cycle and a product of two disjoint
transpositions?
In[17]:= Order [ Group[ P[{1,2,3}], P[{1,2},{3,4}]
] ]
Out[17]= 12
These two appear to generate A4 as well. Let's see how these calculations extend
to A5. We could use two 3-cycles again. But that would not work in A6. So we
shall try with a 5-cycle and a 3-cycle:

3.5. EXERCISES
47
In[18]:= Order [ Group[ P[{1,2,3,4,5}], P[{1,2,3}]
] ]
Out[18]= 60
And 60 is the order of A5. We now try a 5-cycle and a product of two disjoint
transpositions:
In[19]:= Order[ Group[ P[{1,2,3,4,5}], P[{1,2},{3,4}]
] ]
Out[19]= 60
This works too. Do these calculations extend to A6? Do they generalize to An ,
for arbitrary n?

Linear Groups
4.1
Definitions and Examples
Think of the set of all rotations about the origin in the Euclidean plane. Let α(t)
denote the rotation through the angle t counterclockwise. It can be represented
by the matrix
(
cos t
−sin t
sin t
cos t
)
.
If we multiply two such rotations together we get another rotation, and the in-
verse of a rotation is also a rotation. In fact,
α(t)α(t′) = α(t + t′)
α(t)−1 = α(−t) .
So if we set
G = {α(t) | t ∈R} ,
we get a collection of real 2×2 matrices which has the same algebraic properties
as a permutation group. Such sets of square matrices are called linear groups. We
want to allow matrices with coefficients in an arbitrary field.
An m × n matrix defined over a field F is a rectangular array

CHAPTER 4. LINEAR GROUPS
where aij ∈F for 1 ≤i ≤m, 1 ≤j ≤n. Matrix multiplication and addition
can be defined just as in the case F = R. And they have the same formal
properties. We denote by M(m, n, F) the set of all m × n matrices over F,
by M(n, F) the set of all n × n matrices, and by GL(n, F) the subset of all
invertible matrices in M(n, F).
Definition 4.1. A linear group G is a non-empty set of matrices in GL(n, F)
such that
(i) if α, β ∈G, then αβ ∈G;
(ii) if α ∈G, then α−1 ∈G .
Thus GL(n, F) itself is a linear group, called the general linear group (of degree
n over F). Another simple example is the special linear group which is defined by
SL(n, F) := {α ∈GL(n, F) | det α = 1}.
The determinant of a matrix α ∈M(n, F) is defined just as for F = R and has
the same basic properties. Now for α, β ∈SL(n, F),
det(αβ) = det α det β = 1
det(α−1) = (det α)−1 = 1
Thus SL(n, F) is also a linear group.
We are particularly interested in linear groups over the finite fields Fp. If
a linear group G is finite then the order of G, written |G|, is defined to be the
number of elements of G. If G is infinite, we write |G| = ∞.
Examples 4.2.
(i) For any field F let
T =
{(1
b
0
1
)  b ∈F
}
⊂GL(2, F) .
There is a one-to-one correspondence between F itself and T. Under this
correspondence addition in F corresponds to matrix multiplication in T.
It follows that T is a linear group.

4.1. DEFINITIONS AND EXAMPLES
53
(ii) Let N(p) be the set of upper triangular matrices in GL(2, Fp),
N(p) =
{(a
b
0
d
)  a, b, d ∈Fp, ad ̸= 0
}
⊂GL(2, Fp) .
It is easy to see that N(p) is a linear group of order p(p −1)2.
(iii) Let
G(p) =
{( a
b
br
a
)  a, b ∈Fp, a2 −b2r ̸= 0
}
⊂GL(2, Fp)
where r ∈Fp is not a square. It is easy to check that the product of two
matrices in G(p) lies in G(p), as does the inverse of any matrix in G(p).
So G(p) is a linear group.
To compute its order we have to know precisely which matrices have non-
zero determinant. Now the determinant of such a matrix is a2 −b2r. So
first we solve the congruence
a2 −b2r ≡0
(mod p) .
If b ̸≡0 (mod p) then multiplying by b−2 we get
(ab−1)2 −r ≡0
(mod p) .
But then x = ab−1 would be a solution of
x2 ≡r
(mod p)
This has no solutions since r is not a square mod p. Thus we must have
b ≡0 (mod p), which means that a2 ≡0 (mod p) and hence a ≡0
(mod p). Therefore the only solution of our original quadratic congruence
is the trivial one, a = b = 0. It follows that
G(p) =
{( a
b
br
a
)  a, b ∈Fp, a ̸= 0 or b ̸= 0
}
This tells us that
|G| = p2 −1 .

54
CHAPTER 4. LINEAR GROUPS
(iv) Let's compute the order of GL(2, Fp). The number of matrices in M(2, Fp)
is p4. One of these is in GL(2, Fp) if and only if it has rank 2. We need to
determine how many matrices have rank less than 2. A matrix has rank less
than 2 if and only if its column vectors are linearly dependent, i.e. if and
only if one is a multiple of the other. Now for the first column there are
p2 possible choices. For each of these, except (0, 0), there are p distinct
multiples, i.e. possibilities for the second column. This gives (p2 −1)p
possible matrices in all. If the first column is (0, 0), then the second col-
umn can be any vector. This gives another p2 possibilities. So in all there
are
(p2 −1)p + p2 = p3 + p2 −p
matrices of rank less than 2. Therefore the order of GL(2, Fp) is
p4 −p3 −p2 + p = (p −1)2p(p + 1) .
4.2
Generators
As for permutations, we can define the order |α| of an element α of a linear
group to be the smallest n ∈N such that αn = 1. If there is no such n, then we
say that α has infinite order, and write |α| = ∞. In example (i), let
α =
(1
1
0
1
)
.
Then
αb =
(1
b
0
1
)
.
for any b ∈Z. If F = Fp, then
|α| = p .

4.2. GENERATORS
55
But if F = Q, then
|α| = ∞.
Two more examples: for any field F,
(0
1
1
0
)
∈GL(2, F)
has order 2. In GL(2, F5),
(1
0
0
2
)
has order 4 because 24 = 1 in F5, but 22, 23 ̸= 1.
If the order of a matrix α is infinite, then α−1 is not a positive power of α.
So in defining a cyclic linear group, we must include powers of α−1.
Definition 4.3. Let α ∈GL(n, F) for some field F. The cyclic linear group
generated by α is the linear group ⟨α⟩:= {αb | b ∈Z}.
As in permutation groups, we see that the order of an element α is the order
of ⟨α⟩. In general we say that a linear group G is generated by a set g ⊂G if every
element of G can be written as a product of elements of g and their inverses.
Example 4.4. Using row and column operations we can find generators for
GL(2, F). These operations work over an arbitrary field F in exactly the same
way as over R. We begin with a matrix
(a
b
c
d
)
,
a, b, c, d ∈F, ad −bc ̸= 0 .
By interchanging the rows or the columns we can ensure that a ̸= 0. This means
we multiply on the left or on the right by the matrix
(0
1
1
0
)
.
Next, we add a multiple of the first row to the second to eliminate the entry c.
This means multiplying on the left by a matrix of the form
(1
0
x
1
)
, x ∈F .

56
CHAPTER 4. LINEAR GROUPS
We now have a matrix which looks like
(a
b
0
d
)
, ad ̸= 0 .
The next step is to eliminate the entry b. To do this, we add a multiple of the first
column to the second. This means multiplying on the right by a matrix
(1
y
0
1
)
, y ∈F .
We are left with a diagonal matrix which looks like
(a
0
0
d
)
=
(a
0
0
1
) (1
0
0
d
)
, a, d ∈F \ {0} .
So any matrix in GL(2, F) can be written as a product of matrices
(a
0
0
1
)
,
(1
0
0
d
)
,
(1
0
c
1
)
,
(1
b
0
1
)
,
(0
1
1
0
)
, a, d ∈F\{0} , b, c ∈F .
But we can do better:
(0
1
1
0
) (1
c
0
1
) (0
1
1
0
)
=
(1

and
(0
1
1
0
) (d
0
0
1
) (0
1
1
0
)
=
(1
0
0
d
)
.
So all we need are matrices
(a
0
0
1
)
,
(1
b
0
1
)
,
(0
1
1
0
)
, a ∈F \ {0} , b ∈F .
This is our set of generators of GL(2, F), for any field F. If F = Fp, then we
can reduce the number of generators further. As we mentioned before
(1
b
0
1
)
=
(1
1
0
1
)b
for b ∈Z. Thus
{(1

,
(0

)
,
(a

generates GL(2, Fp). It can be shown that
{(a
0
0
1
)  a ∈F \ {0}
}
is a cyclic linear group (see chapter 14). So in fact you can find a set of 3 matrices
which generates GL(2, Fp). For example, take p = 5. In F5 we have 22 =
4, 23 = 3, 24 = 1. Thus every non-zero element of F5 is a power of 2. So every
matrix of the form
(a
0
0
1
)
=
(2
0
0
1
)i
for some i. Therefore
{(1

,
(0

)
,
(2

(4.1)
generates GL(2, F5).
△
This discussion has actually given us an algorithm for expressing a matrix in
GL(2, F) in terms of these generators. Let's apply it to the matrix
(0
2
3
1
)
∈GL(2, F5) .
To begin we must have a non-zero entry in the upper left-hand corner. So we
will interchange columns, or equivalently, multiply the given matrix on the right
by
(0
1
1
0
)
.
This gives us
(0
2
3
1
) (0
1
1
0
)
=
(2
0
1
3
)
.
Next we add 2(row 1) to row 2 to eliminate the first entry:
(1
0
2
1
) (2
0
1
3
)
=
(2
0
0

)
.
So
(1

=

So we have now written the given matrix in terms of the generators (4.1).
Given g ⊂GL(n, F), for some field F and some natural number n, the
linear group generated by g, written ⟨g⟩, is the smallest linear group containing
g. If F is finite then definition 3.7 and the remarks with it apply, as does the
algorithm for computing ⟨g⟩.
4.3
Software and Calculations
The package 'Groups.m' also allows you to make calculations with linear groups
over a field Fp. After loading the package, you must first choose a prime with
the function ChoosePrime . For example

4.3. SOFTWARE AND CALCULATIONS
59
In[1]:= << Groups.m;
In[2]:= ChoosePrime[11]
Out[2]= 11
All your calculations will then be modulo this prime. You can change it at any
time, but if you do not make a choice none of the functions will evaluate. Matrices
are usually represented in Mathematica as lists of lists. In this package, however,
such a representation is wrapped with L[] in order to give a mechanism for
reducing modulo the chosen prime at each step in the calculations. (As well it
avoids confusion with permutations in cycle notation which are also represented
in Mathematica as lists of lists). For example, the general 2 × 2 matrix
(a
b
c
d
)
which is usually represented in Mathematica as
{{a, b}, {c, d}} ,
is represented in this package as
L[{a, b}, {c, d}] .
The same functions you used with permutation groups are defined for linear
groups. For example if
In[3]:= a = L[{1,2},{3,4}]
Out[3]=
(1 2
3 4
)
In[4]:= b = L[{6,3},{7,5}]

60
CHAPTER 4. LINEAR GROUPS
Out[4]=
(6 3
7 5
)
then
In[5]:= Inverse[a]
Out[5]=
(9 1
7 5
)
In[6]:= a.b
Out[6]=
(9 2
2 7
)
Now suppose
In[7]:= ChoosePrime[7]
Out[7]= 7
and
In[8]:= G = { L[{1,1},{1,2}], L[{2,3},{4,1}],
L[{2,6},{6,1}], L[{1,0},{0,1}],
L[{2,1},{6,4}] }
Out[8]=
{ (1 1
1 2
)
,
(2 3
4 1
)
,
(2 6
6 1
)
,
(1 0
0 1
)
,
(2 1
6 4
) }

4.3. SOFTWARE AND CALCULATIONS
61
Then
In[9]:= Inverse[G]
Out[9]=
{ (2 6
6 1
)
,
(2 1
6 4
)
,
(1 1
1 2
)
,
(1 0
0 1
)
,
(2 3
4 1
) }
So G is closed under taking inverses. Let's check whether it is closed under
products:
In[10]:= G.G
Out[10]=
{ (0 5
2 5
)
,
(1 0
0 1
)
,
(1 1
0 4
)
,
(1 1
1 2
)
,
(1 5
0 2
)
,
(2 1
6 4
)
,
(2 2
5 6
)
,
(2 3

)
,
(2 3

,
(2 6

,
(3 4

,
(3 6

(3 6

)
,
(5 4
4 2
)
,
(5 5
4 3
)
,
(6 4
3 5
) }
You see immediately that the product of L[{1,1},{1,2}] with itself is not in
G. So G is not a linear group.
We can verify that GL(2, F5) is generated by the three matrices given in the
previous section. First we change the chosen prime to 5.
In[11]:= ChoosePrime[5]
Out[11]= 5

62
CHAPTER 4. LINEAR GROUPS
Let
In[12]:= H = Group[ L[{{2,0},{0,1}}], L[{{0,1},{1,0}}],
L[{{1,1},{0,1}}] ]
Out[12]=
⟨(2 0

,
(0 1

,
(1 1

Now we check:
In[13]:= Order[H]

Groups
In chapters 3 and 4 we discussed permutation groups and linear groups in a way
that brought out the formal similarities between them. These similarities lead to
the definition of an abstract group. First we must make clear what 'multiplication'
means in a general context and then what its basic properties should be.
5.1
Basic Properties and More Examples
Definition 5.1. A binary operation on a set G is a mapping: G × G →G.
We write such an operation as a 'multiplication', keeping in mind that it can
mean such different operations as matrix multiplication or composition of per-
mutations or addition of real numbers. The basic properties that our operation
should have are those which it has in our two examples.
Definition 5.2. A set G with a binary operation on it is called a group if it has the
following properties:
(i) the operation is associative, i.e. for any α, β, γ ∈G
(αβ)γ = α(βγ) ;
(ii) there is an identity element, written 1 ∈G, i.e. for any α ∈G
α · 1 = 1 · α = α ;
65

66
CHAPTER 5. GROUPS
(iii) every element in G has an inverse, i.e. for every α ∈G there exists an
element written α−1 ∈G such that
α · α−1 = α−1 · α = 1 .
The binary operation on G is called the group operation.
Examples 5.3.
(i) Take G to be a permutation group with composition as
the group operation, as explained in chapter 3. By the definition of a per-
mutation group this is an operation in the above sense. It is certainly as-
sociative. The identity element is the identity permutation (1). And the
inverse of a permutation is the inverse permutation, which belongs to G
again by definition.
(ii) Take G to be a linear group, with matrix multiplication as the group opera-
tion. The definition of a linear group ensures that this is a binary operation.
It is associative. The identity element is the identity matrix I. And every
matrix in G has an inverse in G by definition.
(iii) Let G = Z (or Q, or R or C) with the operation addition. Addition is
associative, the identity element is 0, and the inverse of any a ∈Z is −a.
In fact any field F is a group under addition, as is Z/nZ for any n ∈N.
(iv) Let
F × := {a ∈F | a ̸= 0}
with the operation multiplication. It is associative, with identity element
1 ∈F, and the inverse of any a ∈F is a−1.
(v) The non-zero integers do not form a group under multiplication because
no integer except ±1 has a multiplicative inverse.

5.1. BASIC PROPERTIES AND MORE EXAMPLES
67
(vi) For m ∈N, let
(Z/mZ)× = {¯a ∈Z/mZ | (a, m) = 1} .
If (a, m) = 1 and (b, m) = 1 then (ab, m) = 1. Furthermore, if (a, m) =
1 then as we saw in theorem 1.9, there exists an integer x such that ax ≡1
(mod m). For this congruence to hold, x must be relatively prime to m.
Therefore (Z/mZ)× is a group under multiplication mod m, called the
multiplicative group of Z/mZ. In the particular case where m is a prime
p, we get F×
p .
(vii) Let G = Rn with operation vector addition. It is associative, the vector
(0, 0, . . . , 0) is the identity element, and the inverse of a vector
(a1, a2, . . . , an) is (−a1, −a2, . . . , −an).
(viii) The space of matrices M(m, n, F) under matrix addition is a group.
(ix) Let
S = {a ∈C | |a| = 1} .
Under multiplication S is a group.
(x) Let GL(n, Z) be the set of all invertible n × n matrices with integer
entries whose inverses also have integer entries. Under matrix multipli-
cation GL(n, Z) is a group, just like GL(n, F) for a field F. If α ∈
GL(n, Z) then det(α) and det(α−1) = det(α)−1 are integers. Since
det(α) det(α−1) = 1 , they must both be ±1.
(xi) A mapping α : Rn →Rn is a rigid motion or isometry if it preserves distances,
in other words,
∥α(v) −α(w)∥= ∥v −w∥
for all v, w ∈Rn, where ∥v∥denotes the length of v (cf. [4]). The com-
position of two isometries is again one. It is easy to see that an isometry

68
CHAPTER 5. GROUPS
is injective. One can also show that it is surjective. Thus any isometry has
an inverse, which is also an isometry. Let Iso(n) denote the set of isome-
tries. Composition is a binary operation on Iso(n) which is associative.
The identity mapping is an isometry. So Iso(n) is a group.
(xii) The trivial group is the group with only 1 element, the identity element:
{1}.
(xiii) And now for something completely different: the braid group. Imagine that
we have two parallel lines. On the first one, on the right, we have n points
labelled 1, 2, . . . , n. On the second, on the left, we also have n points
1, 2, . . . , n which are just the translates of the corresponding points on
the first. We join each point on the first line to one on the second line with
a thread, going from right to left, in such a way that no two points on the
first are joined to the same point on the second. This is called a braid.

We consider two such constructions to be the same braid if we can get one
from the other by moving about the strands without changing their end
points. So what matter are the end points and the way the strands cross
each other. We can combine two braids by placing them end to end to get
a new braid.

The trivial braid, in which 1 is joined to 1, 2 to 2, and so on, without any

The inverse of a braid is just the braid obtained by running along the
strands from their end points to their starting points. The braid below
is the inverse of the braid we started with. And the composition shown
above is just the inverse composed with the original braid. You can see
that by moving the strands, you will get the trivial braid.

With this operation the set of braids, denoted by Bn, forms a group. It's a
good idea to make a model with string of braids with 2 strands.
In examples (iii), (iv), (vi), (vii), and (ix) the multiplication is commutative, i.e.
αβ = βα
for all α, β ∈G .
In examples (i) and (ii), as we have seen, it is generally not. A group is called
commutative or abelian if the group operation is commutative. Group elements can
be manipulated formally in the ways you expect:
Theorem 5.4. Let G be a group.
(i) The identity element is unique.
(ii) The inverse of  an element α is unique.
(iii) For any α ∈G,
(
(α)−1)−1 = α.
(iv) For any α, β ∈G, (αβ)−1 = β−1α−1 .
(v) Cancellation rules: For any α, β, γ ∈G,
a) if αβ = αγ, then β = γ;
b) if βα = γα, then β = γ.

5.1. BASIC PROPERTIES AND MORE EXAMPLES
71
Proof. (i) Suppose ϵ ∈G is another identity element, i.e.
ϵα = αϵ = α, for all α ∈G.
Take α = 1. Thus ϵ · 1 = 1. But since 1 is also an identity element ϵ · 1 = ϵ.
Therefore ϵ = 1.
(ii) Let α′ be another inverse for α. So
1 = αα′ = α′α .
Multiply the first equation on the left by α−1 and use associativity:
α−1 = α−1(αα′) = (α−1α)α′ = 1 · α′ = α′ .
Thus α−1 = α′.
(iii) The inverse of α−1 is characterized by the property
(
(α)−1)−1α−1 = 1 = α−1(
(α)−1)−1
But comparing with property (iii) in the definition of a group, we see that α also
satisfies these equations. Since there is a unique inverse for α−1, we must have
(
(α)−1)−1 = α.
(iv) We have
(β−1α−1)(αβ) = β−1(α−1α)β = (β−1 · 1)β = β−1β = 1 .
Similarly
(αβ)(β−1α−1) = 1 .
Therefore β−1α−1 is the inverse of αβ.
(v) Suppose
αβ = αγ.
Multiply on the left by α−1:
α−1(αβ) = α−1(αγ).

72
CHAPTER 5. GROUPS
By associativity,
(α−1α)β = (α−1α)γ
which gives
1 · β = 1 · γ
or
β = γ.
The proof of (b) is analogous.
If a group G is finite, then the number of elements in G is the order of G,
written |G|. If G is infinite, we write |G| = ∞. Suppose α ∈G and there exists
n ∈N so that αn = 1. Then the order of α, written |α|, is the smallest such n.
If no such n exists, we say that α has infinite order, |α| = ∞. As in chapters 3
and 4, we can consider ⟨α⟩= {αn | n ∈Z}. It is easy to see that ⟨α⟩with the
operation inherited from G is a group. And
|⟨α⟩| = |α| .
Of course these definitions just generalize the definitions we made for permuta-
tion groups and linear groups.
Example 5.5. The order of (Z/mZ)× is φ(m) (see page 14). If (10, m) = 1,
then ¯10 ∈(Z/mZ)×. And by theorem 1.6 the order of ¯10 is the length of the
period of 1/m. In particular, this implies that if p is prime, then the length of the
period of 1/p divides p −1.
5.2
Homomorphisms
In example (xii) there is a natural mapping from Bn to Sn. Each braid ζ defines
a permutation αζ with
αζ(j) = endpoint of strand starting at j .

5.2. HOMOMORPHISMS
73
For any α ∈Sn there are many braids ζ ∈Bn with αζ = α. So this mapping is
surjective but not injective. It is well-behaved with respect to the multiplications
in Bn and Sn: from the diagrams we see that
αζ2ζ1 = αζ2αζ1
for any ζ1, ζ2 ∈Bn. Since we know a bit about Sn, the mapping tells us some-
thing about what the group Bn looks like. Such a mapping from one group to
another is called a homomorphism.
Definition 5.6. Let G and H be groups. A mapping f : G →H is called a
(group) homomorphism if for any α, β ∈G,
f(αβ) = f(α)f(β) .
Examples 5.7. We have already seen several other mappings between groups
which are homomorphisms. At the end of chapter 2 we defined the permutation
matrix Iα ∈GL(n, R) belonging to a permutation α ∈Sn. Recall that the jth
row of Iα is just the α(j)th row of the identity matrix. We saw that
Iαβ = IαIβ
for any α, β ∈Sn. Thus the mapping p : Sn →GL(n, R) given by
p : α 7→Iα
is a homomorphism. We also know that for any field F, the determinant
det : GL(n, F) →F ×
satisfies
det(αβ) = det(α) det(β)
for any α, β ∈GL(n, F). So det is also a homomorphism. A final example:
addition in Z/nZ was defined so that the canonical mapping Z →Z/nZ given
by a 7→¯a is a homomorphism.

74
CHAPTER 5. GROUPS
Homomorphisms have the formal properties that you would expect.
Theorem 5.8. Let f : G →H be a group homomorphism. Then
(i) f(1G) = 1H ;
(ii) f(α−1) = f(α)−1 for any α ∈G ;
(iii) if f is bijective, then f −1 : H →G is also a homomorphism.
Proof. We have
f(1G) = f(1G1G) = f(1G)2 .
Multiply on the left by f(1G)−1:
1H = f(1G)−1f(1G) = f(1G)−1f(1G)2 = f(1G) .
It follows that for any α ∈G,
1H = f(1G) = f(αα−1) = f(α)f(α−1) .
Therefore f(α−1)
=
f(α)−1. Lastly suppose that f is bijective. For any
σ, τ ∈H, we have
f
(
f −1(στ)
)
= στ
On the other hand,
f
(
f −1(σ)f −1(τ)
)
= f
(
f −1(σ)
)
f
(
f −1(τ)
)
= στ
as well. Since f is injective, it follows that
f −1(στ) = f −1(σ)f −1(τ) .
A homomorphism which is bijective is called an isomorphism. Two groups G
and H are said to be isomorphic, written G ∼= H, if there exists an isomorphism
f : G →H.

5.2. HOMOMORPHISMS
75
Example 5.9. Let R+ denote the positive real numbers. Under multiplication
R+ is an abelian group. Let
f : R →R+
be the exponential mapping
f : x 7→ex .
Since ex+y = exey, f is a homomorphism. It has an inverse, the logarithm:
log : R+ →R
So the exponential is an isomorphism of groups. The formula log(zw) = log(z)+
log(w) just says that log is a homomorphism.
△
Given two groups G and H we define their direct product to be the set G × H
with the operation:
(
(α1, β1), (α2, β2)
)
7→(α1α2, β1β2)
where α1, α2 ∈G and β1, β2 ∈H. It is not hard to see that this operation makes
G × H into a group (see exercise 16). For example, R2 with vector addition is
the direct product of R with itself. The two projections:
p1 : G × H →G
p1 : (α, β) 7→α
and
p2 : G × H →H
p2 : (α, β) 7→β ,
for α ∈G, β ∈H, are homomorphisms.

76
CHAPTER 5. GROUPS
Example 5.10.
(i) Let's show that GL(3, R) is isomorphic to SL(3, R) ×
R×. We define a mapping
f : SL(3, R) × R× →GL(3, R)
by
f : (α, a) 7→aα
for α ∈SL(3, R) and a ∈R×. We see immediately that f is a homomor-
phism. To define an inverse to f, first notice that the mapping
h : R× →R×
given by
h(a) = a3
is an isomorphism. And if α ∈GL(3, R), then (det α)−1/3α has deter-
minant 1. Therefore, since det is a homomorphism, the mapping
g : α 7→((det α)−1/3α, (det α)1/3)
is a homomorphism from GL(3, R) to SL(3, R)×R×. It is clearly inverse
to f.
(ii) Suppose that m, n ∈N and (m, n) = 1. For any a ∈Z, let ¯a denote its
residue class mod mn, ¯a1 denote its residue class mod m and ¯a2 denote
its residue class mod n. Define a mapping
g : Z/mnZ →(Z/mZ) × (Z/nZ)
by
g(¯a) := (¯a1, ¯a2) .
This mapping is well-defined because for any k ∈Z ,
a + kmn ≡a
(mod m)
and
a + kmn ≡a
(mod m) .

5.3. EXERCISES
77
We have
g(¯a + ¯b) = (¯a1 + ¯b1, ¯a2 + ¯b2) = (¯a1, ¯a2) + (¯b1,¯b2) = g(¯a) + g(¯b) .
So g is a homomorphism. Now the Chinese remainder theorem (theorem
1.12) says precisely that g is an isomorphism. Why is this? Well, what does
it mean for g to be surjective? Given integers a and b, we must show that
there exists an integer c such that
c ≡a
(mod m)
and
c ≡b
(mod n) .
And to say that g is injective is to say that such an integer c is unique mod
mn.

Subgroups
6.1
Definition
Subgroups are subsets of groups which are groups themselves under the oper-
ation inherited from the group. Of course for this to be possible, the product
of two elements of the subgroup must lie in it, and so must the inverse of every
element. It turns out that this is in fact enough.
Definition 6.1. Let G be a group. A non-empty subset H ⊆G is a subgroup
of G, written H < G, if for all α, β ∈H
αβ ∈H
(i)
α−1 ∈H .
(ii)
Condition (i) ensures that the group operation on G gives us an operation on
H. It is associative because the operation on G is. Since H is non-empty, there
exists an element α ∈H. By (ii), α−1 ∈H as well. Therefore 1 = αα−1 ∈H
by (i). And by (ii) again, the inverse of every element in H lies in H. So H with
the operation inherited from G is a group.
Looking back at chapters 3 and 4 we see that permutation groups were de-
fined as subgroups of Sn and linear groups as subgroups of GL(n, F). Looking
at the list of examples in chapter 5, we see that in example 3
Z < Q < R < C .
81

82
CHAPTER 6. SUBGROUPS
6.2
Orthogonal Groups
There are some further examples of linear groups which are going to be of in-
terest to us. These are the orthogonal groups, which consist of those isometries
which are linear mappings. Recall that a real n × n matrix α is orthogonal if
∥αv∥= ∥v∥
for all v ∈Rn. If we denote by O(n) the set of orthogonal matrices, then
O(n) = GL(n, R) ∩Iso(n) .
Thus O(n) is a subgroup of Iso(n) and of GL(n, R). The special orthogonal
group, SO(n), is given by
SO(n) = O(n) ∩SL(n, R) .
So it is a subgroup of O(n) and SL(n, R) (as well as of Iso(n) and of GL(n, R)).
It is not hard to describe the elements of SO(2). A matrix ( a b
c d ) ∈SO(2)
if and only if
a2 + c2 = 1
b2 + d2 = 1
ab + cd = 0
ad −bc = 1 .
The first equation tells us that there exists t ∈R such that (a, c) = (cos t, sin t).
The third equation implies that (b, d) = r(−sin t, cos t) for some r ∈R. From
the second, we can conclude that r = ±1, and from the fourth, that r = 1. Thus
(a
b
c
d
)
=
(
cos t
−sin t
sin t
cos t
)
.
So the elements of SO(2) are just the rotations about the origin and t is the
angle of rotation. Multiplying two matrices corresponds to adding the angles of
rotation.

6.2. ORTHOGONAL GROUPS

We can also say what elements of O(2) whose determinant is −1 look like.
Set
ρ =
(−1
0
0
1
)
.
If α ∈O(2) and det α = −1, then det ρα = 1. So ρα is of the form
(
cos t
−sin t
sin t
cos t
)
.
for some t, and therefore α can be written
α =
(−cos t
sin t
sin t
cos t
)
.
Viewed geometrically ρ is a reflection in the line x = 0. It is easy to say what
a reflection is in general, in any dimension. Let v ∈Rn be a unit vector, and set
W = v⊥. Define ρv ∈O(n) by
ρv(v) = −v
,
ρv|W = IW .
Then ρv is a reflection in the hyperplane W. For an arbitrary vector w ∈Rn we
have
ρv(w) = w −2(w · v)v
If we pick an orthonormal basis {v2, . . . , vn} of W, the matrix of ρv with respect
to {v, v2, . . . , vn} is

Thus det ρv = −1.
Lastly let's describe what an element α ∈SO(3) looks like. First we check
that 1 is an eigenvalue: since det α = 1,
det(α −I) = det(αt −I) = det α det(αt −I)
= det(ααt −α) = det(I −α)
= −det(α −I) .

84
CHAPTER 6. SUBGROUPS
Therefore det(α−I) = 0. Let v then be an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1. Since
α is orthogonal the plane W := v⊥is invariant under α and it is easy to see that
det α|W = det α = 1 .
So α|W ∈SO(2). Now let {w1, w2} be an orthonormal basis of W. Then with
respect to the orthonormal basis {v, w1, w2} of R3, a matrix of α has the form



In other words α is a rotation about the line through v through the angle t. Notice
that
tr α = 2 cos t .

Cyclic Subgroups and Generators
If G is a group and α ∈G then ⟨α⟩= {αn | n ∈Z} is called the cyclic subgroup
generated by α. If ⟨α⟩= G, then G is a cyclic group.
Theorem 6.2. An infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to Z. A cyclic group of  order n is
isomorphic to Z/nZ.
Proof. Let G be a cyclic group with generator α. Define a mapping f : Z →G
by
f : m 7→αm
for m ∈Z. Since
f(m1 + m2) = αm1+m2 = αm1αm2 = f(m1)f(m2) ,
f is a homomorphism. Since G = ⟨α⟩, f is surjective.

6.3. CYCLIC SUBGROUPS AND GENERATORS
85
Now there are two possibilities. First suppose that |G| = ∞. Then αm ̸= 1
for all m ̸= 0. If αm1 = αm2 for some m1, m2, then αm1−m2 = 1. But then
m1 −m2 = 0. So f is injective and therefore is an isomorphism.
The second possibility is that |G| = n, for some n ∈N, i.e. |α| = n. Now
f(m + sn) = αm+sn = αm = f(m) for any s. So f defines a mapping
¯f : Z/nZ →G
which is also a surjective homomorphism. Since both groups have order n, ex-
ercise 5.20 implies that f is also injective and therefore an isomorphism.
Thus any two cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic. It is not true
in general that two groups of the same order are isomorphic. For example, the
group V which has order 4 is not isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 4, because
it has no element of order 4.
More generally, if g ⊂G then the subgroup generated by g, written ⟨g⟩, is
the subgroup consisting of all elements of G that can be expressed in terms of
the elements of g and their inverses. We have to make this more precise. If G is
finite, then we have
⟨g⟩=
∞
∪
i=0
gi
as in chapter 3. Otherwise the description is more complicated. We must include
expressions of the form
αe1
1 αe2
2 · · · αek
k
where ei = ±1 for all i and αi ∈g. Such expressions are called words in g.
Theorem 6.3. Let
H = {αe1
1 αe2
2 · · · αek
k | k > 0, ei = ±1, αi ∈g, 1 ≤i ≤k} .
Then H is the smallest subgroup of G containing g and is the intersection of  all the subgroups
of G containing g.

86
CHAPTER 6. SUBGROUPS
Proof. Certainly H ⊃g and is thus non-empty. The product of any two words in
g is another word in g. And the inverse of a word is as well. So H is a subgroup.
Clearly H is contained in any subgroup of G which contains g. Therefore H is
the smallest such subgroup. To see that H is the intersection of all the subgroups
containing g we need only show:
Lemma 6.4. The intersection K of  a collection C of  subgroups of G is again a subgroup.
Well, K ̸= ∅since 1 ∈K. If α, β ∈K, then for any L ∈C we have
α, β ∈L and therefore αβ ∈L and α−1 ∈L. It follows that αβ, α−1 ∈K.
And thus K is a subgroup of G.
Example 6.5. In the group GL(n, Z) we have the subgroup
SL(n, Z) := {α ∈GL(n, Z) | det α = 1} .
The purpose of this example is to find a pair of generators for SL(2, Z). Suppose
α =
(a

)
∈SL(2, Z) .
By applying the Euclidean algorithm to a and b, we are going to find an expression
for α in terms of
σ =

and
τ =

In particular, this will prove that

Now applying the Euclidean algorithm to a and b gives us a list of equations:
a = qb + r
0 ≤r < b
b = q1r + r1
0 ≤r1 < r
...

ri−1 = qi+1ri + ri+1
0 ≤ri+1 < ri
...
...
rn−2 = qnrn−1 + rn
0 ≤rn < rn−1
rn−1 = qn+1rn
Since ad −bc = 1, it follows that (a, b) = 1 and therefore rn = 1. We begin by
multiplying α on the right by τ −q:

where the entries * denote integers which are not important to us, and the result-

=
(r

Again the resulting matrix has determinant 1. In general we will have a matrix in

or
(ri

depending upon whether i is odd or even. We multiply it by τ −qi+1, respectively

At the end we are left with(rn

or

.
Now rn = 1 and the matrices have determinant 1. So in the first case we have a

for some integer k. In the second case we have a matrix of the form

So we have shown that
ατ −qσ−q1 · · · = τ k or τ kστ −1σ ,

α = τ k · · · σq1τ q or τ kστ −1σ · · · σq1τ q .
Let's do a numerical example. Take
α =
(19

.
Applying the Euclidean algorithm gives us
19 = 2 · 7 + 5
7 = 5 + 2
5 = 2 · 2 + 1
2 = 2 · 1 .

6.3. CYCLIC SUBGROUPS AND GENERATORS

So we first multiply α by τ −2:

Example 6.6. It is not hard to describe a set of generators of the braid group
Bn. For 1 < i < n, let ζi be the following braid: if j ̸= i, i + 1, the jth strand
joins point j on the first line to point j on the second without crossing any other
strand. The ith strand joins point i on the first line to point i + 1 on the second,
crossing under the (i + 1)st strand, which joins point i + 1 on the first to point
i on the second.

To see that {ζ1, . . . , ζn−1} generates Bn, take any braid ζ, and perturb the strands
so that no two crossovers occur at the same level. Draw lines parallel to the two

each containing only one crossover. Then in each slice, the braid is one of the

Kernel and Image of  a Homomorphism
Suppose G and H are groups and f : G →H is a homomorphism. The kernel
of f, written ker(f), is defined by
ker(f) := {α ∈G | f(α) = 1H} ⊂G .
It measures how close f is to being injective, as we shall see below. The image of
f, written im(f), is the set of images of the elements of G in H, i.e.
im(f) := {f(α) | α ∈G} ⊂H .

6.4. KERNEL AND IMAGE OF A HOMOMORPHISM
91
Theorem 6.7. The kernel of  a homomorphism f is a subgroup of G, and the image a
subgroup of H. A homomorphism is injective if  and only if  its kernel is trivial.
We just need to verify that ker(f) and im(f) fulfill the definition of a sub-
group. Well, suppose α, β ∈G and f(α) = 1 and f(β) = 1. Then
f(αβ) = f(α)f(β) = 1
and
f(α−1) = f(α)−1 = 1 .
Therefore ker(f) is a subgroup of G. And for any α, β ∈G, f(α)f(β) =
f(αβ) ∈im(f), and f(α)−1 = f(α−1) ∈im(f). Thus im(f) is a subgroup of
H.
Lastly, suppose f is injective. Then in particular, if f(α) = 1 for some
α ∈G, since f(1) = 1, we have α = 1. Thus ker(f) = {1}. On the other
hand, assume ker(f) = {1}. Now if f(α) = f(β) for some α, β ∈G, we have
1 = f(α)f(β)−1 = f(α)f(β−1) = f(αβ−1) .
So αβ−1 ∈ker(f), and therefore αβ−1 = 1, i.e. α = β. Thus f is injective.
Examples 6.8.
(i) Recall that det : GL(n, F) →F × is a homomorphism
for any field F. By the definition of SL(n, F)
ker(det) = SL(n, F) .
(ii) The kernel of the canonical map: Z →Z/nZ is the subgroup nZ ⊂Z.
(iii) Let f : S →S be given by f(z) := zn, for some n ∈N. The kernel of f
is
{z ∈C | zn = 1} .
A complex number z satisfying this equation is called an nth root of unity.
We shall denote the group of nth roots of unity by µn.

92
CHAPTER 6. SUBGROUPS
(iv) If G and H are two groups, then the kernel of the projection p1 : G×H →
G is H.
(v) In chapter 5, we saw that there is a natural homomorphism
br : Bn →Sn ,
where br(ζ) = αζ .
The permutation αζ maps i to the endpoint of the i th strand of ζ. So
αζi = (i i + 1)
Since
{(1 2), (2 3), . . . , (n −1 n)}
generates Sn, the homomorphism br is surjective.

Symmetry Groups
Intuitively we know when an object has symmetry and when not. Symmetry is
closely related to our sense of what is beautiful. A rose window in a cathedral with
its rotational symmetry is beautiful, as is a face with strong bilateral symmetry (see
[5]). The octagon on the left below has no symmetry, while the one on the right
is highly symmetric.
We would like a mathematically precise definition of symmetry which fits with
our intuitive sense. The regular octagon above can be reflected in the dotted line.
We can also rotate it about its centre through an angle of π/4. The rotation and
reflection are both isometries of the Euclidean plane. This suggests a general
definition.
Suppose X is an object in Euclidean n-space. A symmetry of X is an isom-
etry which maps X to itself. We denote by Sym(X) the set of all symmetries of
X. Not surprisingly, Sym(X) is a subgroup of Iso(n). For the identity map is
97

98
CHAPTER 7. SYMMETRY GROUPS
always a symmetry of X so that Sym(X) is not empty. The inverse of a sym-
metry is again a symmetry and so is the product of two symmetries. To say that
X is highly symmetric is to say that Sym(X) is large. If X has no symmetry at
all, then Sym(X) is the trivial group As references for Euclidean geometry, [6],
[4], and [7] are recommended.
7.1
Symmetries of  Regular Polygons
Let's begin by looking at the symmetry groups of regular polygons in the plane.
We will place the centre of the polygon at the origin, so that the symmetries are
all elements of the orthogonal group (see [4], p.11).
.

Figure 7.1: Symmetries of an equilateral triangle
First we consider an equilateral triangle P3. We can rotate P3 about its centre
through 2π/3, 4π/3, and 2π. (All angles are measured counterclockwise.) And
we can reflect P3 in the line joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
Thus Sym(P3) has 6 elements, 3 rotations and 3 reflections. Notice that if we
label the vertices 1, 2, 3 (counterclockwise), then the symmetries permute the 3
vertices. The rotations correspond to (1 2 3), (1 3 2), and (1) respectively. The

7.1. SYMMETRIES OF REGULAR POLYGONS

Figure 7.2: Symmetries of a square
reflections leave a vertex fixed and switch the other two. So they each correspond
to a transposition. This mapping
Sym(P3) →S3
is in fact an isomorphism of groups since it maps the product of two symmetries
to the product of the corresponding permutations.
Next look at a square P4 (see introduction of chapter 3). We can rotate P4
about its centre through π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π. There are two types of reflections:
reflections in the diagonals, and reflections in the lines joining the midpoints of
opposite sides. Of each type there are two. So in all, Sym(P4) consists of 4
rotations and 4 reflections. Again we can label the vertices of P4: 1, 2, 3, 4. Each
symmetry gives a permutation of the vertices and the mapping
Sym(P4) →S4
defined this way is a homomorphism: the product of two symmetries is mapped
to the product of the corresponding permutations. The rotations correspond to
(1 2 3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4 3 2) and (1) respectively. Reflections about a diagonal
correspond to the transpositions (1 3) and (2 4). The other two reflections

100
CHAPTER 7. SYMMETRY GROUPS
correspond to (1 2)(3 4) and (1 4)(2 3). As we saw in chapter 3, these are just
the elements of the permutation group D4. So we have an isomorphism
Sym(P4)
∼
=
−−−→D4 .
These examples generalize. Let Pn be a regular n-gon, n ≥3. We can rotate
Pn about its centre through angles 2π/n, 4π/n, . . . , (2n −2)π/n, 2π . The
reflectional symmetry of Pn depends on whether n is even or odd.
Figure 7.3: Symmetries of a regular n-gon
First suppose n is odd. Pn is symmetric about the line joining a vertex to
the midpoint of the opposite side. There are n reflections of this type. Now
suppose n is even. Then there are two types of reflections: those in a line joining
the midpoints of opposite sides, and those in a diagonal joining opposite vertices.
There are n/2 reflections of each type. In either case, Sym(Pn) has n rotations
and n reflections. It is called the dihedral group of order 2n We shall denote it
by Dn. As in the cases n = 3, 4, we can label the vertices 1, 2, . . . , n. The
symmetries of Pn permute the vertices and thus each correspond to an element
of Sn. The rotations correspond to the powers of (1 2 · · · n). Since each
symmetry is determined by its action on the vertices of Pn, this mapping from
Dn into Sn is injective and gives us an isomorphism of Dn with a permutation
group of degree n.

7.2. SYMMETRIES OF PLATONIC SOLIDS
101
There is another way of looking at dihedral groups, independent of whether
n is even or odd. Let σ ∈Dn be a rotation through 2π/n counterclockwise, and
let τ ∈Dn be any reflection. The n rotations are σj, 1 ≤j ≤n. And the n
reflections are σjτ, 1 ≤j ≤n -- this is best checked geometrically. One can
also see στ = τσ−1. We say that σ, τ generate Dn subject to the relations
σn = 1
τ 2 = 1
στ = τσ−1 .
(7.1)
because they describe multiplication in Dn completely. If n is even, then τ, σ2τ, . . .
will be the reflections of one type, and στ, σ3τ, . . . of the other.
7.2
Symmetries of  Platonic Solids
What about the symmetry groups of the Platonic solids? We shall only look at
the proper symmetries (see exercise 9 for the full symmetry group). This means
that we first place the centre of the solid at the origin so that the isometry group
will be a subgroup of O(3). And then we restrict our attention to Sym+(X) :=
Sym(X) ∩SO(3).
Let's begin with X the regular tetrahedron. There are two types of rotations
which are symmetries of X. First, we can rotate about the line through a vertex
and the centre of the opposite face. In the diagram below, the gray line is such
an axis. There are two rotations, through angles 2π/3 and 4π/3. Since there are
4 vertices, there are 8 such rotations in all. Secondly, we can rotate about a line
like the black one, through the midpoints of opposite edges, by an angle of π.
There are 6 edges. So this gives us 3 more rotations. Together with the identity,
the symmetry group therefore has 12 elements. As with the regular polygons, we
can regard these symmetries as permutations of the vertices of X, which we label
1, 2, 3, 4. Then the first type of rotation corresponds to a 3-cycle, and the second
one to a product of two disjoint transpositions. But these, with the identity, are
just the 12 even permutations in S4. This mapping is a homomorphism, and
therefore the group of proper symmetries of the regular tetrahedron, which we
denote by T, is isomorphic to A4.

102
CHAPTER 7. SYMMETRY GROUPS
Figure 7.4: Symmetries of a tetrahedron
Next we look at the proper symmetries of the cube. This is the same as the
proper symmetry group of the regular octahedron, because it is just the dual of
the cube. First there are the rotations about an axis like the black one below,
through the centres of a pair of opposite faces, through angles π/4, π/2, and
3π/4. Since there are 3 such pairs of faces, this gives 9 rotations in all. Secondly,
we can rotate the cube through angles 2π/3 and 4π/3 about a diagonal, like
the light gray one, joining a pair of opposite vertices. There are 8 vertices and
therefore 8 of these rotations. Thirdly, we can rotate through an angle of π about
an axis like the dark gray one, through the midpoints of a pair of antipodal edges.
The cube has 12 edges and thus 6 of these rotations. Together with the identity,
this gives us 24 proper symmetries. We denote this group by O.
If we simply regard these symmetries as permutations of the 8 vertices, we get
a homomorphism of O into S8 which is certainly injective.
Now,
|S8| = 40320. So the image is a relatively small subgroup, and this homomor-
phism does not tell us much about O. However there is a more enlightening way

7.2. SYMMETRIES OF PLATONIC SOLIDS
103
Figure 7.5: Symmetries of a cube: axes of rotations
of identifying O with a permutation group. Instead of the 8 vertices, take the 4
diagonals shown below as the objects being permuted. Let's convince ourselves
that this mapping into S4 is injective. Since |S4| = 24, our homomorphism is
then again an isomorphism. Suppose that a proper symmetry fixes all 4 diago-
nals. Rotations of the first type do not fix any diagonals. Those of the second
type fix only the diagonal which is their axis and no other. And the third type of
symmetry fixes no diagonal. So one which fixes all 4 must be the identity. Thus
the kernel of our homomorphism is trivial and therefore it is injective.
Finally we consider the proper symmetries of the regular dodecahedron or its
dual, the regular icosahedron. The regular dodecahedron has 12 faces, 30 edges,
and 20 vertices. The faces are regular pentagons and 3 edges meet at each vertex.
There are three types of rotational symmetries. First we can rotate through angles
of 2π/3 and 4π/3 about an axis passing through a pair of opposite vertices, like
the one in light gray. There are 20 such rotations. Secondly, we can rotate through
an angle of π about a line like the dark gray one passing through the midpoints of a
pair of antipodal edges. We have 15 of these rotations. And lastly, we can rotate

104
CHAPTER 7. SYMMETRY GROUPS
Figure 7.6: Symmetries of a cube: diagonals
about a line like the black one through the centres of a pair of opposite faces,
through angles 2π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, and 8π/5. This gives a further 24 rotations.
In all we have 60 proper symmetries. Let I denote the proper symmetry group
of the regular dodecahedron or icosahedron.
Again we can realize these symmetries as permutations. What should we
take as the objects permuted? Well, the 30 edges can be grouped into 15 pairs of
antipodal edges. The 15 lines through the midpoints of these pairs form 5 sets of
mutually orthogonal triples or trihedra. In the picture below, the edges belonging
to each trihedron all have the same colour. One trihedron is shown. These 5
trihedra are permuted by the symmetries of the icosahedron. Thus we have a
homomorphism of the proper symmetry group into S5. The rotations of order
3 correspond to 3-cycles. Those of order 2, to products of disjoint transpositions.
And those of order 5, to 5-cycles. Notice that all these permutations are even,
and that in fact all 60 elements of A5 are realized in this way. Thus I is isomorphic

CHAPTER 7. SYMMETRY GROUPS
7.3
Improper Symmetries
We have computed the groups of proper symmetries of the Platonic solids. But
they obviously have reflectional symmetry as well. In general, an element α ∈
Sym(X) with det α = −1 is called an improper symmetry. Examples are re-
flections in a plane and the antipodal map −I ∈O(3). It is easy to see that
−I ∈Sym(X) for all five Platonic solids. Therefore by exercise 6.16,
Sym(X) ∼= Sym+(X) × {±I} .
The improper symmetries are the set −I · Sym+(X) = −Sym(X).
Let's look at them in the case of the cube. Since |O| = 24, there are also 24
improper symmetries. First of all there are reflections. The mirrors are planes
bisecting pairs of opposite faces. As the pictures below show, there are two types.
The first type gives 3 reflections, the second 6 reflections, for a total of 9.
Figure 7.9: Reflections of a cube
This leaves 15 improper symmetries. They are rotatory reflections. A rotatory
reflection is a rotation followed by a reflection in the plane perpendicular to the

7.4. SYMMETRIES OF EQUATIONS
107
axis of the rotation (see [4], p.16 or [6], 7.4). An example is a rotation through
π/2 about the vertical line followed by a reflection in the horizontal plane. The
antipodal map is just a rotation through π about the same line followed by the
reflection.

7.4
Symmetries of  Equations
Symmetry also plays an important role in the study of algebraic equations. Sup-
pose we have a polynomial equation p(x) = 0 with rational coefficients:
p(x) = xn + a1xn−1 + · · · + an−1x + an = 0
where a1, . . . , an ∈Q. We assume that p is irreducible, i.e. does not factor into
polynomials of lower degree with rational coefficients. In the complex numbers,
p = 0 has n roots, z1, . . . , zn, which we will assume are distinct. We are in-
terested in permutations of these roots which preserve any algebraic relations
among them. These form a permutation group of degree n which reflects the

108
CHAPTER 7. SYMMETRY GROUPS
symmetries among the roots. For a generic polynomial p there will only be "triv-
ial" relations and the group will simply be Sn. However, for special polynomials
there will be non-trivial relations and the symmetry group will not be the full
permutation group.
Let's look at the equation
0 = x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1 = (x5 −1)/(x −1)
The roots are
z1 = e2πi/5 ,
z2 = e4πi/5 ,
z3 = e6πi/5 ,
z4 = e8πi/5 .
In the picture below, they are shown on the unit circle in C.
.
.e2πi/5
.e4πi/5
.e6πi/5
.e8πi/5
We have
z2 = z2
1 ,
z3 = z3
1 ,
z4 = z4
1 .
We are looking for permutations of the 4 roots which preserve these relations. If
α is such a permutation, then α(z2), α(z3), and α(z4) are determined by α(z1),
which can be z1, z2, z3, or z4.
(i) α(z1) = z1: then
α(z2) = α(z1)2 = z2
α(z3) = α(z1)3 = z3
α(z4) = α(z1)4 = z4 .
So α = (1).

7.4. SYMMETRIES OF EQUATIONS
109
(ii) α(z1) = z2: then
α(z2) = α(z1)2 = z2
2 = z4
α(z3) = z3
2 = z1
α(z4) = z4
2 = z3 .
Therefore α = (1 2 4 3).
(iii) α(z1) = z3: then
α(z2) = z2
3 = z1
α(z3) = z3
3 = z4
α(z4) = z4
3 = z2 .
Thus α = (1 3 4 2).
(iv) α(z1) = z4: then
α(z2) = z3
α(z3) = z2
α(z4) = z1 .
So α = (1 4)(2 3).
Therefore the symmetry group of the equation is the cyclic group ⟨(1 2 4 3)⟩.
As a second example, consider the equation
x4 −10x2 + 1 = 0.
Its roots are
z1 =

z2 = −

z3 =

They satisfy the relations
z1 + z4 = 0
(i)
z2 + z3 = 0
(ii)
(z1 + z2)2 = 12
(iii)
(z1 + z3)2 = 8
(iv)
(z2 + z4)2 = 8
(v)
(z3 + z4)2 = 12 .
(vi)

110
CHAPTER 7. SYMMETRY GROUPS
We are interested in permutations of z1, z2, z3, z4 which preserve these rela-
tions. Well, (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3) and (1) do. No other permutations
do. To see this we check one transposition, one 3-cycle and one 4-cycle. The oth-
ers are similar. Now (1 2) takes relation (i) to
z2 + z4 = 0 .
But this contradicts relation (v). The 3-cycle (1 2 3) does the same. The 4-cycle
(1 2 3 4) takes (i) to
z2 + z1 = 0 ,
contradicting relation (iii). Thus the symmetry group of this polynomial is the
group
V = {(1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3), (1)} .
The symmetry group of a polynomial equation is usually called its Galois group.
We shall study Galois groups more extensively in later chapters.

Group Actions
8.1
Examples
In the previous chapter, we looked at how the symmetry group of a regular poly-
gon permutes its vertices, and how the symmetry group of a cube permutes the
4 diagonals. Realizing these groups as permutation groups of a set of objects
told us a lot about them. In this chapter, we are going to pursue this point of
view. In general one says that a group G acts on a set X (usually finite) if one is
given a homomorphism G →SX. A more convenient way to express this is the
following.
Definition 8.1. We say that a group G acts on a set X if we have a mapping
G × X →X, whereby (α, x) 7→α · x ∈X, such that
(αβ) · x = α · (β · x)
1 · x = x
for all α, β ∈G and x ∈X.
Where there is no possibility of confusion, we shall just write αx instead of α·x.
For example, if G = O and X = {d1, d2, d3, d4}, the set of 4 diagonals of a
cube, then the mapping O →X is given by
(α, di) 7→α(di) ,
where α ∈O and 1 ≤i ≤4. Here are two further examples which will interest
us greatly.
113

114
CHAPTER 8. GROUP ACTIONS
Examples 8.2.
(i) A group G acts on itself by multiplication on the left: for
ξ ∈G and α ∈G we set
α · ξ := αξ .
Then (i) is satisfied because the group operation is associative: for β ∈G,
(αβ) · ξ = (αβ)ξ = α(βξ) = α · (β · ξ)
and (ii) because 1 is the identity for the group operation:
1 · ξ = 1ξ = ξ .
(ii) A group G acts on itself by conjugation: for ξ ∈G and α ∈G we set
α · ξ := αξα−1.
Then for β ∈G,
(αβ) · ξ = (αβ)ξ(αβ)−1 = α(βξβ−1)α−1 = α · (β · ξ)
and
1 · ξ = 1ξ1−1 = ξ .
It is not hard to see that this definition does give you a homomorphism G →
SX. For each α ∈G we can define a permutation σα of X:
σα(x) := α · x .
This map σα is bijective because it has an inverse, namely σα−1:
σα−1σα(x) = α−1(α x) = (α−1α) x = x
and therefore σα−1σα = 1. Similarly, σασα−1 = 1. Furthermore, the mapping
σ : G →SX, given by
σ : α 7→σα
is a homomorphism. For
σαβ(x) = (αβ) · x = α (β x) = α · σβ(x) = σα
(
σβ(x)
)
.
and hence σαβ = σασβ.

8.2. ORBITS AND STABILIZERS
115
8.2
Orbits and Stabilizers
If the group G acts on the set X, the orbit of a point x ∈X is the set
Ox := {αx | α ∈G} ⊂X .
The stabilizer of x is the subgroup
Gx := {α ∈G | αx = x} .
Example 8.3. If we take
X = {1, 2, 3, 4}
and
G = V ′ = {(1), (12), (34), (12)(34)} ⊂S4 ,
then
O1 = O2 = {1, 2},
O3 = O4 = {3, 4}
and
V ′
1 = V ′
2 = ⟨(34)⟩,
V ′
3 = V ′
4 = ⟨(12)⟩.
The group
V = {(1), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}
also acts on this set. However
O1 = O2 = O3 = O4 = X,
V1 = V2 = V3 = V4 = {(1)} .
In chapter 3 we looked at the decomposition of a permutation α ∈Sn into
a product of cycles. The cycles we found correspond to the orbits of the permu-
tation group ⟨α⟩acting on the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. The orbit of 1 is
O1 = {1, α(1), α2(1), . . . , αr1−1(1)} ,
which gives us the first cycle. We then pick the smallest number i2 which does
not occur in O1 and compute its orbit:
Oi2 = {i2, α(i2), α2(i2), . . . , αr2−1(i2)} .

116
CHAPTER 8. GROUP ACTIONS
This gives us the second cycle, and so on.
In general if a group G acting on a set X has only one orbit, we say that G acts
transitively on X. If G is a permutation group of degree n which acts transitively
on {1, 2, . . . , n} we say that G is transitive.
Remark 8.4. In general, Ox = Oy, for x, y ∈X, if and only if there exists an
α ∈G such that αx = y. Why is this so? Suppose that αx = y. If z = βy ∈Oy,
then βαx = βy = z so that z ∈Ox. Thus
Oy ⊂Ox .
By writing α−1y = x, we can reverse the roles of x and y and see that
Ox ⊂Oy .
Therefore Ox = Oy. Conversely, if Ox = Oy, then y ∈Ox and therefore there
exists α ∈G such that αx = y. If there is only one orbit, then for all x and y,
we have Ox = Oy or equivalently, for all x and y there exists α ∈G such that
αx = y.
Many of the permutation groups that we have seen act transitively on the set
{1, 2, . . . , n}. However the stabilizers may not be trivial. For example, taking
G = Sn, we see that any permutation which fixes 1 can permute {2, . . . , n}
quite arbitrarily. So (Sn)1 is the group of all permutations of {2, . . . , n}, which
is isomorphic to Sn−1.
The group of proper symmetries of a Platonic solid acts transitively on the set
of vertices, the set of edges, and the set of faces. What do the stabilizers look like?
Let's look at the regular tetrahedron. First pick a vertex. The rotations whose axis
passes through the vertex and the centre of the opposite face leave it fixed. No
other rotations of order 3 do so. A rotation of order 2 whose axis passes through
the centres of a pair of opposite edges, does not fix any vertex. So the stabilizer
of a vertex is the cyclic group of order 3 consisting of the rotations about the line
through the vertex and the centre of the opposite side. The only rotation which
fixes a given edge is the half-turn about the line joining its midpoint and that of

8.2. ORBITS AND STABILIZERS
117
the opposite edge. So its stabilizer is the cyclic group of order 2 generated by this
half-turn. And the stabilizer of a face is just the stabilizer of the opposite vertex.
In example (i) above G acts transitively on itself. Why? Take ν, ξ ∈G. Let
α = ξν−1. Then
αν = (ξν−1)ν = ξ.
The stabilizer of any element ξ is trivial, because αξ = ξ implies that α = 1.
The action of G on itself by conjugation (example (ii)) is more interesting:
first some terminology. The orbit of an element ξ ∈G under conjugation is
called its conjugacy class and will be denoted by Cξ. So
Cξ := {αξα−1 | α ∈G} .
An element αξα−1 is called a conjugate of ξ. The stabilizer of ξ is called its
centralizer, denoted by Zξ(G) or just Zξ:
Zξ := {α ∈G | αξα−1 = ξ} = {α | αξ = ξα} .
Thus the centralizer of ξ is the set of all elements which commute with ξ. The
centre of G, written Z(G), is
Z(G) = {α | αβ = βα, for all β ∈G}
So
Z(G) = ∩ξZξ(G) .
If G is abelian then of course Z(G) = G.
Let's compute the conjugacy classes of Sn.
Lemma 8.5. Suppose ν = (i1, . . . , ir) ∈Sn is an r-cycle. Then ανα−1 is the r-cycle
(
α(i1), . . . , α(ir)
)
.
Proof. We have
α(ij)
α−1
−−−→ij
ν
−−−→ij+1
α
−−−→α(ij+1) ,

118
CHAPTER 8. GROUP ACTIONS
where as usual, ir+1 := i1. (Remember that we are reading from right to left.) If
i ̸∈{α(i1), . . . , α(ir)}, then α−1(i) ̸∈{i1, . . . , ir}, so that
i
α−1
−−−→α−1(i)
ν
−−−→α−1(i)
α
−−−→i .
Thus
ανα−1 =
(
α(i1), . . . , α(ir)
)
.
It also follows from this lemma that if we are given a second r-cycle ξ, there
exists an α ∈G such that ξ = ανα−1. Namely, if ξ = (j1, . . . , jr), then define
α(i1) = j1, . . . , α(ir) = jr ,
and extend α to the rest of {1, 2, . . . , n} in any way you like as long as α is
bijective. Then by the lemma, ξ = ανα−1. Thus the set of all r-cycles is a
conjugacy class.
Now suppose that ν = ν1 · · · νs where ν1, . . . , νs are disjoint cycles of length
r1, . . . , rs respectively. We say that ν is of cycle type {r1, . . . , rs}. Then for any
α ∈G, we have
ξ := ανα−1 = αν1α−1 · · · ανsα−1 .
Therefore ξ too is of cycle type {r1, . . . , rs}. On the other hand, given any two
elements ν and ξ of the same cycle type, we can refine the argument just given
to see that there exists an α such that ξ = ανα−1. This proves the following
theorem:
Theorem 8.6. A conjugacy class in Sn consists of  all permutations of  a given cycle type.
For example, the possible cycle types in S5 are
{1}
{2}
{3}
{2, 2}
{4}
{2, 3}
{5} .
And to each of these there corresponds a conjugacy class in S5. Notice that a
cycle type is given by any set {r1, . . . , rs} ⊂N, where r1 + · · · + rs = n. Such

8.3. FRACTIONAL LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
119
a set is called a partition of n. The list above can also be regarded as the possible
partitions of 5. As with cycle decompositions, we write {3} instead of {3, 1, 1}
and so on.
8.3
Fractional Linear Transformations
In this section we will look at an action of GL(2, F) on the projective line. More
will be said about it in example 10.13(iii) and it will be important in chapter 12.
You may well be familiar with fractional linear transformations over the complex num-
bers. Given a matrix
α =
(a
b
c
d
)
∈GL(2, C) ,
one defines
sα(z) = az + b
cz + d
which takes on complex values for z ∈C, except at z = −d/c. To deal with
this value, one extends sα to the extended complex line (or Riemann sphere),
P(C) = C ∪{∞}, by setting
sα(−d/c) = ∞,
sα(∞) = a/c .
The reason for the latter formula is, that if you write
sα(z) = a + b/z
c + d/z ,
and then set 1/z = 0, you obtain a/c.
This works perfectly well for any field F, not just C. The extended affine
line, or projective line, over F can be defined formally by
P(F) := F ∪{∞} .
Then for
α =
(a
b
c
d
)
∈GL(2, F) ,

120
CHAPTER 8. GROUP ACTIONS
we set
sα(x) := ax + b
cx + d ,
x ∈F , x ̸= −d/c ,
and
sα(−d/c) = ∞,
sα(∞) = a/c .
It is easy to check that we have defined an action of GL(2, F) on P(F). This
action is transitive because we can see that O0 = P(F): take any b ∈F, then
sα(0) = b
for
α =
(1
b
0
1
)
and
sα(0) = ∞
for
α =
(0
1
1
0
)
.
The action is particularly interesting when F = Fp, for some prime p. We can
write P(Fp) as
P(Fp) = {0, 1, . . . , p −1, ∞}
and can regard each sα as a permutation of this set of p+1 elements. In this way
the action gives us a homomorphism fp : GL(2, Fp) →Sp+1, with fp(α) := sα.
Theorem 8.7.
ker fp = F×
p · I = Z
(
GL(2, Fp)
)
Proof. Clearly, F×
p · I ⊂ker fp. Suppose that α ∈ker(fp). Then sα(x) = x for
all x ∈P(Fp). In particular this holds for x = 0, 1, ∞. This means that α lies
in the stabilizers of 0, 1, and ∞. Let's compute the stabilizer of 0: we have
0 = sα(0) = a · 0 + b
c · 0 + d = b
d
if and only if b = 0. So the stabilizer of 0 is
{(a
0
c
d
)
∈GL(2, Fp)
}
.

8.3. FRACTIONAL LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
121
Similarly,
∞= sα(∞) = a
c
if and only if c = 0. Thus the stabilizer of ∞is
{(a
b
0
d
)
∈GL(2, Fp)
}
.
So if α fixes both 0 and ∞, then
α =
(a
0
0
d
)
,
for some a, d ∈F×
p . If in addition, α fixes 1, then
1 = α(1) = a/d ,
and therefore a = d. Thus α = aI for some a ∈Fp, and
ker(fp) = {aI | a ∈F×
p } .
In exercise 11 it is shown that this is the centre of GL(2, F), for any field F.
Let's look at this map for p = 2. If we take
α =
(1
1
0
1
)
,
we have
sα(x) = x + 1 .
Thus
sα(0) = 1,
sα(1) = 0,
sα(∞) = ∞.
So
f2(α) = (0 1) .
For
β =
(0
1
1
0
)
,
we have
sβ(x) = 1
x .
Thus
sβ(0) = ∞,
sβ(1) = 1,
sβ(∞) = 0 .

122
CHAPTER 8. GROUP ACTIONS
So
f2(β) = (0 ∞) .
As we saw in chapter 3, these two transpositions generate S3. So the image of f2
must be all of S3. Since
ker(f2) = {aI | a ∈F×
2 } = {I} ,
f2 is injective as well, and therefore an isomorphism.
Now let's consider f3. We know that
|GL(2, F3)| = 48
and
|S4| = 24 ,
and
ker(f2) = {I, 2I} .
So f3 is not an isomorphism. However it is surjective. We can again find matrices
mapping onto three transpositions which generate S4. Take
α =
(2
1
0
1
)
β =
(2
2
0
1
)
γ =
(0
1
1
0
)
Then
sα(x) = 2x + 1
sβ(x) = 2x + 2
sγ(x) = 1
x
and
f3(α) = (0 1)
f3(β) = (0 2)
f3(γ) = (0 ∞) .
The action of GL(2, F) on P(F) is more than just transitive. In fact given
two triples of distinct points in P(F), there exists an α ∈GL(2, F) such that sα
maps one triple to the other. To see this we shall show that given three distinct
elements u, v, w ∈P(F), we can find an α such that
sα(0) = u
sα(1) = v
sα(∞) = w .

8.4. CAYLEY'S THEOREM
123
Let
α =
(a
b
c
d
)
.
Then the three equations above are
sα(0) = b/d = u
sα(1) = (a + b)/(c + d) = v
sα(∞) = a/c = w .
Substituting the first and third into the second, we get
(cw + du)/(c + d) = v
which has the solution
c = d(v −u)/(w −v) ,
for d ∈F ×. Thus we have a solution α, unique up to multiplication by a non-
zero scalar, in other words by a matrix in the centre of GL(2, F). This means
that sα is uniquely determined.
If a group G acts on a set X and maps any distinct triple of points in X to any
other, then we say that the action is triply transitive . If it maps any distinct pair
of points to any other, it is called doubly transitive. So the action of GL(2, F)
on P(F) is triply transitive and you can check that the action of SL(2, F) on
P(F) is doubly transitive (see exercise 25).
Remark 8.8. The upper half plane, H = {z ∈C| im z > 0} ∪{∞} with the
Poincar´e metric is a model for the hyperbolic plane (see [9], chap. 7). The action
of SL(2, R) on P(C) preserves H. In fact SL(2, R)/{±I} is the group of
proper isometries of H.
8.4
Cayley's Theorem
As we saw in the first section, defining an action of a group G on a set X, is the
same as giving a homomorphism
σ : G →SX .

124
CHAPTER 8. GROUP ACTIONS
The kernel of σ is
{α ∈G | αx = x for all x ∈X} ,
in other words, those elements of G which act trivially on X. It is sometimes
called the kernel of the action.
Now suppose that G is a finite group, and let G act on itself by multiplication
on the left. Then the mapping σ is a homomorphism from G →SG. And
ker(σ) = {α ∈G | αξ = ξ for all ξ ∈G}
But taking ξ = 1, we see that such an α must be 1. So σ is injective. This gives
us a result known as Cayley's Theorem:
Theorem 8.9. Let G be a finite group of  order n. Then G is isomorphic to a permutation
group of  degree n, more precisely to a subgroup of  the group of  permutations of G itself.
8.5
Software and Calculations
The function Orbit[G,x] will compute the orbit of x under the permutation
group G. Here x is a positive natural number or a vector. For example,
In[1]:= A5 = Group[ P[{1,2,3}], P[{3,4,5}] ]

CHAPTER 8. GROUP ACTIONS
The conjugacy class of an element can be calculated with the function
ConjugacyClass. Let's use it to compute the conjugacy classes in A5. To begin
with, we know that the conjugacy classes in S5 correspond to the cycle types of
permutations of degree 5. The even cycle types are
{1}, {3}, {5}, {2, 2} .
The function CycleTypes computes the number of permutations in each cycle
type:
In[7]:= CycleTypes[A5]
Out[7]=


1
3
5
22
1
20
24
15
0.017 0.33 0.4 0.25


(The last row in the output is the density of each cycle type, i.e. the ratio of the
number of permutations of the given cycle type to the order of A5). Now two
elements in A5 may be conjugate by an element in S5 but not by an element in
A5. So a conjugacy class of S5 may break up into more than one conjugacy class
in A5. We begin with a 3 -cycle:
In[8]:= ConjugacyClass[ A5, P[{1,2,3}] ]
Out[8]= { (1 2 3), (1 2 4), (2 3 4), (1 4 3),
(2 4 5), (3 4 5), (2 5 3), (1 2 5),
(2 3 5), (2 4 3), (1 3 4), (1 4 2),
(2 5 4), (3 5 4), (1 3 5), (1 4 5),
(1 5 2), (1 3 2), (1 5 3), (1 5 4) }
These are all 20 3-cycles. Next we look at the conjugacy class of a 5-cycle:

8.5. SOFTWARE AND CALCULATIONS
127
In[9]:= ConjugacyClass[ A5, P[{1,2,3,4,5}] ]
Out[9]= { (1 2 3 4 5), (1 2 4 5 3), (1 2 5 3 4),
(1 4 5 2 3), (1 4 2 3 5), (1 5 2 4 3),
(1 3 2 5 4), (1 3 5 4 2), (1 4 3 5 2),
(1 5 4 3 2), (1 5 3 2 4), (1 3 4 2 5) }
This is only half of the 5-cycles! One that is missing is (1 2 3 5 4) . So let's
compute its conjugacy class:
In[10]:= ConjugacyClass[ A5, P[{1,2,3,5,4}] ]
Out[10]= { (1 2 3 5 4), (1 2 4 3 5), (1 2 5 4 3),
(1 5 4 2 3), (1 3 5 2 4), (1 4 3 2 5),
(1 5 3 4 2), (1 3 4 5 2), (1 4 5 3 2),
(1 3 2 4 5), (1 4 2 5 3), (1 5 2 3 4) }
These are the remaining 5-cycles. Lastly we look at the conjugacy class of a
product of two transpositions:
In[11]:= ConjugacyClass[ A5, P[{1,2},{3,4}] ]
Out[11]= { (1 2)(3 4), (1 4)(2 3), (1 3)(2 4),
(1 2)(4 5), (2 3)(4 5), (2 4)(3 5),
(2 5)(3 4), (1 2)(3 5), (1 3)(4 5),
(1 4)(3 5), (1 4)(2 5), (1 5)(3 4),
(1 5)(2 3), (1 3)(2 5), (1 5)(2 4) }
These are all 15 permutations of type {2, 2}. So these four sets together with
{(1)} are the conjugacy classes of A5.
The centre of a group can be computed with the function
Centre. For

Counting Formulas
9.1
The Class Equation
If a group G acts on a set X, then X breaks up into the disjoint union of the
various orbits of G. When X and G are finite we can obtain formulas relating the
number of elements in the orbits and stabilizers and in X, and for the number
of fixed points of the elements of G. These formulas are useful in studying
the structure of abstract finite groups and of symmetry groups. They also have
applications to combinatorial problems. For any finite set Y , we shall denote the
number of elements in Y by |Y |.
Recall that in example 8.3 we looked at the actions of V ′ and V on X =
{1, 2, 3, 4}, and determined the orbits and stabilizers. For V ′ we found that
|V ′
x| = 2
and
|Ox| = 2 ,
and for V
|Vx| = 1
and
|Ox| = 4 ,
for any x ∈X. So in both cases |Gx||Ox| = |G| . This relation holds in general.
Suppose we have a group G acting on a set X. Fix a point x ∈X, and define
a map
e : G →Ox
by
e(α) = α · x ,
133

134
CHAPTER 9. COUNTING FORMULAS
for α ∈G. This map is surjective by the definition of the orbit of x. When do
two elements α, β ∈G have the same image y under e? Well, αx = βx = y
means that α−1βx = x or equivalently, that
γ := α−1β ∈Gx .
On the other hand, if γ ∈Gx, then
(αγ)x = αx = y .
Thus
e−1(y) = α Gx := {αγ | γ ∈Gx}
where αx = y.
.
.αGx
.Gx
.G
.Ox
.y

Now suppose that |G| is finite. We have a bijection
Gx ↔e−1(y)
given by γ ↔αγ , so that
|e−1(y)| = |Gx| .

9.1. THE CLASS EQUATION
135
Since
G =
⊔
y∈Ox
e−1(y) ,
it follows that
|G| =
∑
y∈Ox
|e−1(y)| =
∑
y∈Ox
|Gx| = |Ox||Gx| .
This gives us our formula.
Formula 9.1. |G| = |Ox||Gx| .
Typically one uses this to compute |Gx|. For example in exercise 8.16, the
group G = G72 acts transitively on {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Therefore |G1| = 72/6 =
12. Or if we let X be the set of vertices of a cube, and G = O, then G acts
transitively, so that the order of any stabilizer is 24/8 = 3. Notice that this
equation says that |Ox| always divides |G|.
Next we look at a formula for |X| in terms of data about the orbits. There
is an equivalence relation hiding in any group action. Define
x ∼y
if
Ox = Oy .
This relation is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, and therefore is an equivalence
relation. By remark 8.3,
x ∼y
if and only if
αx = y ,
for some α ∈G. The equivalence class of an element x is its orbit Ox. Since
distinct equivalence classes are disjoint, it follows that distinct orbits are disjoint.
If X too is finite, then we can obtain a count of the elements of X. Let x1, . . . , xr
be representatives of the orbits of G. Then
X =
r⊔
i=1
Oxi .
Combining this with (9.1), we have

136
CHAPTER 9. COUNTING FORMULAS
Formula 9.2.
|X| = ∑r
i=1|Ox| = ∑r
i=1|G|/|Gxi| .
Let's consider this formula in the case where G acts on itself by conjugation.
So the orbits are the conjugacy classes. If an element α ∈Z(G) then its conju-
gacy class is just {α} because α commutes with every element of G. Conversely,
any element whose conjugacy class has only one element in it must commute
with all elements of G and therefore lies in Z(G). Let α1, . . . , αr be representa-
tives of the other, non-trivial conjugacy classes. Then equation (9.2) gives us the
following result:
Theorem 9.3 (The Class Equation).
|G| = |Z(G)| +

∑
j=1
|Cαj| = |Z(G)| +

Examples 9.4.
(i) Take G = S4. We know that the conjugacy classes are
given by the cycle types. The possible cycle types are
{1}
{2}
{3}
{4}
{2, 2}
The number of elements in the corresponding conjugacy classes are 1, 6,
8, 6, and 3 respectively. So the class equation is
24 = 1 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 3 .
(ii) In the last section of the previous chapter we computed the conjugacy
classes of A5 directly. We now want to make this calculation in a different
way. As pointed out there the possible cycle types are
{1}
{3}
{5}
{2, 2} .
These correspond to conjugacy classes in S5. We must decide whether two
permutations which are conjugate in S5 are also conjugate in A5. For this
we need the following observation.

9.1. THE CLASS EQUATION
137
Remark 9.5. If a group G acts on a set X and H < G, then Hx = Gx ∩H
for any x ∈X.
Recall that |S5| = 120 and |A5| = 60. First we check whether the set of 3-
cycles is a conjugacy class in A5. The number of 3-cycles is 20. Therefore
the centralizer of a 3-cycle, say ξ = (123), in S5 has order 120/20 = 6
by (9.1). Now (4 5) commutes with (1 2 3) and so does (1 2 3) itself. But
⟨(1 2 3), (4 5)⟩has order 6. So
Zξ = ⟨(1 2 3), (4 5)⟩.
The intersection
Zξ ∩A5 = ⟨(1 2 3)⟩,
which has order 3. Therefore the order of the conjugacy class of ξ in A5
is 60/3 = 20. So the set of 3-cycles is a single conjugacy class in A5 too.
Next, let's look at the set of 5-cycles. There are 24 of them, which means
that the centralizer of one of them in S5 has order 120/24 = 5. So this
centralizer is just the cyclic subgroup generated by the 5-cycle itself. This
subgroup lies in A5. Therefore the order of the conjugacy class of the
5-cycle in A5 is 60/5 = 12. So the set of 5-cycles breaks up into two
conjugacy classes in A5.
Lastly we make the calculation for the set of all products of two disjoint
2-cycles. There are 15 of them, so that the order of the centralizer of
one of them in S5 is 8. Again, we pick one, say ξ = (1 2)(3 4). Now
(1 3 2 4) commutes with it since (1 3 2 4)2 = (1 2)(3 4). So do (1 3)(2 4)
and (1 4)(2 3). This gives us a subgroup of order 8 which must be the
centralizer of ξ in S5:
Zξ = ⟨(1 4)(2 3), (1 3 2 4)⟩.
Now
Zξ ∩A5 = ⟨(1 4)(2 3), (1 2)(3 4)⟩∼= V .

138
CHAPTER 9. COUNTING FORMULAS
Therefore the conjugacy class of (1 2)(3 4) in A5 has order 60/4 = 15 as
well, and is the set of all products of two disjoint transpositions. So the
class equation is
60 = 1 + 20 + 12 + 12 + 15 .
(iii) Take G = Dn. In chapter 7 we saw that
Dn = {1, σ, . . . , σn−1, τ, στ, . . . , σn−1τ} ,
where σ is a rotation and τ is a reflection which satisfy the relations
σn = 1
τ 2 = 1
στ = τσ−1 .
It follows that
σ(σjτ)σ−1 = σj+2τ ,
where the index j is taken modulo n, and
τσjτ = σn−j .
Using this let's work out what the conjugacy classes are for n = 4 and
n = 5. For n = 4 this tells us that Z(D4) = {1, σ2} and that the other
conjugacy classes are
{τ, σ2τ}
{στ, σ3τ}
{σ, σ3} .
So the class equation is
8 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 .
For n = 5, the centre is trivial. The conjugacy class of τ is
{τ, σ2τ, σ4τ, στ, σ3τ} .
Since the order of every conjugacy class must divide 10, the remaining
classes must each have order 2. So they are
{σ, σ4},
{σ2, σ3} .

9.2. A FIRST APPLICATION
139
The class equation is
10 = 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 .
We see that in the case n = 4 the two different types of reflections each
form a conjugacy class. When n = 5 there is only one type of reflection
and only one conjugacy class. It is not hard to generalize this calculation
to arbitrary n (see exercise 2).
9.2
A First Application
Our first application is a result which is useful in classifying groups whose order
is a prime power.
Definition 9.6. A p-group is a group of order ps for some s > 0.
For example, D4 and Q are 2-groups, and Z/3Z × Z/3Z is a 3-group.
Theorem 9.7. Suppose G is a p-group for some prime p. Then the centre of G is not trivial.
Proof. According to the class equation
|G| = |Z(G)| +
r
∑
j=1
|Cαj|
where α1, . . . , αs are representatives of the non-trivial conjugacy classes of G.
Since the order of each non-trivial conjugacy class divides |G| they must each be
a power of p. Therefore their sum is a multiple of p. Hence p divides |Z(G)| as
well.
For example, as was shown in the previous section, and in exercise 8.12, the
centre of D4 has order 2 and is thus not trivial. This theorem will allow us to
classify groups of order p2.

140
CHAPTER 9. COUNTING FORMULAS
9.3
Burnside's Counting Lemma
Our second application is a formula for the number of orbits of a finite group
acting on a finite set. It is useful in combinatorial problems with symmetry. First
we need a definition. If H is a subgroup of a group G, the conjugate of H by
α ∈G is the subgroup
αHα−1 := {αβα−1 | β ∈H} .
Two subgroups H and K are conjugate to one another if there exists an α ∈G
such that
K = αHα−1 .
In exercise 8.9 you saw that if G acts on X and two points x, y ∈X lie in the
same orbit, then their stabilizers Gx and Gy are conjugate to one another.
Theorem 9.8 (Burnside's Lemma). Let G be a finite group acting on a finite set X.
Denote by mα, the number of  fixed points of α ∈G and by s, the number of  orbits of G in
X. Then
s = 1
|G|
∑
α∈G
mα .
Proof. First suppose that G acts transitively. So s = 1, and we want to show that
|G| =
∑
α∈G
mα .
Set
Y = {(α, x) ∈G × X | αx = x} .
Now we count |Y | in two different ways. If we pick an x ∈X, then (α, x) ∈Y
if and only if α ∈Gx. So the number of such pairs is |Gx|. For any y ∈X, Gy
is conjugate to Gx and therefore |Gy| = |Gx|. Hence, summing over y, we have
|Y | =
∑
y∈X
|Gy| =
∑
y∈X
|Gx| = |X||Gx| = |G| ,

9.3. BURNSIDE'S COUNTING LEMMA
141
by (9.1). On the other hand, if we choose an α ∈G, then the x ∈X such that
(α, x) ∈Y are just the fixed points of α. So summing over α, we get
|Y | =
∑
α∈G
mα .
We can now do the general case. Since G acts transitively on each orbit, the
formula we have just proved applies to each orbit. The total number of fixed
points an element α has, is the sum of the number of fixed points in each orbit.
Therefore
s|G| =
∑
α∈G
mα .
In example 8.3 the group V ′ acts on {1, 2, 3, 4}. There are 2 orbits. Let's
count the fixed points. For α = (1), we have mα = 4. For α a transposition,
mα = 2. And for α = (1 2)(3 4), mα = 0. So Burnside's formula is
2 = 1
4(4 + 2 + 2 + 0) .
Example 9.9. Suppose we want to count the number of ways of colouring the
vertices of a regular pentagon black or white. Since there 5 vertices, and 2 ways
to colour each one, the simplest answer is:
25 = 32.
But suppose we are making a necklace with 5 beads, each coloured black or white.
Then we do not want to distinguish between two patterns which can be trans-
formed into one another by a symmetry of the pentagon, for example

142
CHAPTER 9. COUNTING FORMULAS
To count these, let X be the set of 32 patterns. The symmetry group of the
pentagon, D5, acts on X. We want to know how many orbits there are. The
Burnside formula will tell us, once we have computed the number of fixed points
of each symmetry. There are 3 different types of symmetry to consider. First,
α = 1. Then mα = 32. Secondly, α could be one of the 4 non-trivial rotations.
The only patterns which a rotation leaves invariant are the 2 which are all black
or all white. So in this case, mα = 2. Lastly, α could be one of the 5 reflections.
Recall that these reflect the pentagon in a line passing through a vertex and the
midpoint of the opposite side. So one vertex is fixed and the other four are
interchanged in pairs. There are 2 ways of colouring each pair and of colouring
the fixed vertex. So mα = 23 = 8. Substituting these numbers into the formula,
we have
10s = 32 + 4 · 2 + 5 · 8 = 80 ,
where s is the number of orbits. Therefore s = 8. Here are 8 patterns which
represent the 8 orbits.
9.4
Finite Subgroups of SO(3)
Our second application of formula (9.1) is to find the finite subgroups of SO(3).
We already know the subgroups T, O, I. The dihedral groups also can be realized

9.4. FINITE SUBGROUPS OF SO(3)
143
as groups of rotations of geometric objects. Take a regular n-gon in the plane.
Construct a pyramid above it and one of the same height below it. A rotation
of the n-gon in the plane can be extended to a rotation of the solid about the
line joining the peaks of the two pyramids. A reflection can be extended to a
rotation through an angle of π about the axis of the reflection. Thus Dn can be
embedded in SO(3) as a group of symmetries of this solid. Since Dn contains
a cyclic subgroup of order n, it too is a subgroup of SO(3). We shall see that
these are essentially all the finite subgroups. The way we shall demonstrate this
is to consider the fixed points of a group of rotations acting on the unit sphere
S2,
S2 := {v ∈R3 | ∥v∥= 1} .
Remark 9.10. If α ∈O(3) then for any v ∈R3, ∥αv∥= ∥v∥, in particular if
∥v∥= 1, then ∥αv∥= 1. So O(3) acts on S2. Any subgroup of O(3), for
example T, also acts on S2.
Definition 9.11. If a group G acts on a set X, the set of fixed points of G is
{x | αx = x for some α ̸= 1} = {x | Gx ̸= {1}} .
For example, take G = T, acting on S2. Each non-trivial element in T is a
rotation about an axis. The axis meets S2 in a pair of antipodal points, which are
fixed by the rotation. These two points belong to the set of fixed points. The
rotations about a line through a vertex and the centre of the opposite face give
4 pairs of fixed points. The rotations about an axis joining the midpoints of a
pair of opposite edges give another 3 pairs. In the picture below the arcs on the
sphere are the edges of an inscribed tetrahedron projected onto the sphere. The
centre of one face is shown.

CHAPTER 9. COUNTING FORMULAS
Theorem 9.12. Let G < SO(3) be a finite subgroup. Then G is conjugate to a cyclic
group, to Dn, n ≥2, to T, to O, or to I.
Proof. As a subgroup of SO(3), G acts on S2. Each non-trivial rotation in G
fixes the two points where its axis meets the sphere. The set of all such pairs
of antipodal points is the set of fixed points of G, which we shall denote by X.
Now suppose x ∈X is fixed by α ∈G. Take any β ∈G. Then βx is fixed by
βαβ−1. So βx ∈X. Thus G acts on X.
Let O1, . . . , Os be the orbits of G in X. The stabilizer of a point in an orbit
Oj has order
nj := |G|/|Oj| ,
(9.1)
for 1 ≤j ≤s, by equation (9.1). Since all the points in X have non-trivial
stabilizers, nj ≥2.
We now count fixed points as in the proof of Burnside's lemma. Let
Y = {(α, x) | αx = x, α ∈G \ {1}, x ∈X} .
For fixed x, (α, x) ∈Y if and only if α ∈Gx \{1}. If x ∈Oj, then the number
of such elements α is nj −1. So the points x ∈Oj contribute |Oj|(nj −1)

elements α. Summing over j, we then get
|Y | =
s
∑
j=1
|Oj|(nj −1) .
On the other hand, if we fix α ∈G \ {1}, then (α, x) ∈Y if and only if x is
a fixed point of α. As we already noted, each rotation α has 2 fixed points. So
summing over α ∈G \ {1}, we obtain
|Y | =
∑
α∈G\{1}
2 = 2(|G| −1) .
Thus
2(|G| −1) =
s
∑
j=1
(nj −1)|Oj| .
Substitute the value of |Oj| from equation (9.1):

Now divide through by |G| and rearrange terms:

(9.2)
This is the equation we must analyze. First, notice that since all nj ≥2, each
term on the left is at most 1/2. So we have the inequality
s
2 ≥s −2 + 2
|G| > s −2 ,
which implies that
2 > s
2 .
Thus s ≤3. This leaves us with three cases to discuss.
(i) s = 1.

146
CHAPTER 9. COUNTING FORMULAS
Equation (9.2) becomes:
1
n1

|G| −1 ≤0 ,
since |G| ≥2. Then n1 ≤0 which is impossible.
(ii) s = 2.
Equation (9.2) becomes:
1

n2

|G| .
Multiplying by |G|, and inserting (9.1), we have
|O1| + |O2| = 2 .
Therefore |O1| = |O2| = 1 and n1 = n2 = |G|. Now if G has only 2
fixed points, they must be antipodal. And the line passing through them
must be the axis of rotation of the elements of G. These are then rota-
tions in the plane perpendicular to this axis. So G can be regarded as a
subgroup of SO(2). We saw earlier that finite subgroups of SO(2) are
cyclic. Therefore G is cyclic.
(iii) s = 3.

So at least one is 2, say n1 = 2. If n2, n3 ≥4, then

Therefore we can assume that n2 < 4. The first possible solution is n1 = 2, n2 =
2, n3 = n, where n ≥2 is arbitrary. Now suppose n2 = 3. Then the inequality
becomes
1
2 + 1
3 + 1
n3
> 1 .
Thus we must have that n3 < 6. This gives the other three solutions in the table.
To compute |G| substitute the values of n1, n2 and n3 in equation (9.3).
We return to the proof of the theorem. The entries in the table correspond
to Dn, T, O and I respectively. The four cases are similar. We will do the second
one.
So suppose that n1 = 2, n2 = 3, n3 = 3, and |G| = 12. Then |O1| = 6,
|O2| = 4 and |O3| = 4. We want to convince ourselves that these orbits are
the set of midpoints of the edges of a regular tetrahedron, the set of its vertices
and the set of centres of its faces. Begin with a point in P1 ∈O2. Let l1 be the
line through P1 and the origin. It is the axis of the rotations in GP1, which have
angles of rotation 2π/3 and 4π/3. Pick a point P2 ∈O2 different from P1. Its
orbit under GP1 is {P2, P3, P4}. They all lie in a plane perpendicular to l1 and
are the vertices of an equilateral triangle in this plane.

148

.
.P1

Take the line joining any of these to the origin, say the line l2 joining P2 to
the origin. It is the axis for the rotations of GP2 which permute {P1, P3, P4}.
So these all lie in a plane perpendicular to l2 and form an equilateral triangle.
Thus the 4 points in O2 are equidistant from one another and are the vertices of
a regular tetrahedron. The group G is the group of proper symmetries of this
tetrahedron. The orbits O3 and O1 are the centres of its faces and the midpoints
of its edges respectively. The symmetry groups of any two regular tetrahedra are
conjugate in SO(3). This proves the second case.
This result can also be proved using only spherical geometry: see [8], §3.8.

Cosets
10.1
Lagrange's Theorem
At the beginning of the previous chapter when we looked at the evaluation map
e : G →Ox, we came upon subsets of G of the form αGx, where x ∈X, α ∈
G. Such subsets are called cosets of the stabilizer Gx in G. In general, given a
subgroup K < G, we call a subset
αK := {ακ | κ ∈K}
a left coset of K in G. For example, a left coset of nZ in Z is a set of the form
m + nZ, m ∈Z. This is just the congruence class of m modulo n. A left coset
is not a subgroup of G except for the one coset 1 · K = K, because this is the
only coset containing 1.
Examples 10.1.
(i) What are the left cosets of An in Sn? Well, if α ∈Sn is
even, then αAn = An. If α is odd, then αAn is the set of odd permuta-
tions. So there are 2 cosets: the set of even permutations and the set of
odd permutations.
151

152
CHAPTER 10. COSETS
(ii) Suppose we take G = S3 and K = ⟨(1 2)⟩. Then
(1)K = K
(1 2)K = K
(1 3)K = {(1 3), (1 3 2)}
(2 3)K = {(2 3), (1 2 3)}
(1 2 3)K = {(2 3), (1 2 3)}
(1 3 2)K = {(2 3), (1 2 3)} .
Thus there are 3 left cosets: K = {(1), (1 2)}, {(1 3), (1 3 2)}, and
{(2 3), (1 2 3)}.
(iii) Here are the left cosets of V in A4:
V = {(1), (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)}
(1 2 3)V = {(1 2 3), (2 4 3), (1 4 2), (1 3 4)}
(1 3 2)V = {(1 3 2), (1 4 3), (2 3 4), (1 2 4)} .
(Check this calculation yourself!)
(iv) Let G = R2 with vector addition, and let K be a line through (0, 0). The
left cosets of K in G are the translates v + K, v ∈R2, of K.
.
.v + K
.K
The last section of this chapter explains Mathematica functions which compute
cosets. One can also look at the right cosets of K in G: they are subsets of the form
Kα, α ∈G. We denote the set of left cosets of K in G by G/K. We already

10.1. LAGRANGE'S THEOREM
153
used the notation Z/nZ for the set of congruence classes mod n, otherwise
known as the integers mod n. If G/K is finite, then the number of elements in
it is called the index of K in G, written [G : K].
Notice that in the examples we have just looked at, every left coset has the
same number of elements, namely |K|, and distinct cosets are disjoint. As a result
of this, [G : K]|K| = |G|. For example, there are 3 left cosets of V in A4. Each
has 4 elements, and |A4| = 12.
Theorem 10.2 (Lagrange's Theorem). If G is a finite group and K a subgroup of G,
then
|G| = [G : K]|K| .
Proof. The theorem can be proved in the way suggested above. This is done in
exercise 1. It also follows from formula 9.1, as we going to see now. The group
G acts on the set G/K by left multiplication: define
α · (βK) := (αβ)K ,
for α, β ∈G. This is a variant of the action of G on itself by multiplication on
the left and you show that it is an action in the same way. It too is transitive:
given two cosets, βK, γK ∈G/K, the group element α = γβ−1 satisfies
α · βK = γK .
So there is only the one orbit, with [G : K] points in it. The stabilizer of the
coset K is the subgroup K. We can now apply our formula relating the number
of points in an orbit to the order of the stabilizer:
|G| = [G : K]|K| .
Corollary 10.3. The order of  a subgroup divides the order of  the group.

154
CHAPTER 10. COSETS
For example, S3 can have subgroups of order 1, 2 and 3, but not of order 4 or
5. It is not hard to write down these subgroups. First there is the trivial subgroup
of order 1. Subgroups of order 2 are those generated by a transposition. There
are 3 of these. There is exactly one subgroup of order 3, namely A3 = ⟨(123)⟩.
The graph below shows how these subgroups fit together. It is called the lattice
of subgroups of S3.

Corollary 10.4. The order of  an element divides the order of  the group.
A consequence of this is that if |G| = n, then for any α ∈G
αn = 1 .
Corollary 10.5. A group of  prime order is cyclic.
Proof. Let G be a group of order p, where p is prime. The order of any element
in G must divide p. Therefore it must be either 1 or p. So if α ∈G, α ̸= 1, then
⟨α⟩= G.
Thus groups of order 2, 3, 5 and 7 are all cyclic. On the other hand we know
of a group of order 4 which is not cyclic, namely V , and one of order 6 which is
not cyclic, S3.

10.1. LAGRANGE'S THEOREM
155
Let's apply corollary 10.4 to the group F×
p . Since it has order p −1 the
corollary tells us that ap−1 = 1 for any a ∈F×
p , or equivalently
ap−1 ≡1
(mod p)
for any a ∈Z, (a, p) = 1. But we can extend this to all integers if we multiply
the congruence by a:
Theorem 10.6 (Fermat's Little Theorem).
ap ≡a
(mod p)
for all a ∈Z.
The converse to Lagrange's theorem is not true. If G is a finite group and d
divides |G|, there need not be a subgroup of order d. Here is an example.
Example 10.7. Look at A4. It consists of eight 3-cycles, 3 products of disjoint
transpositions and the identity. Each 3-cycle generates a cyclic subgroup of order
3. Any two of them generate the whole group (see page 46). Each element of
type {2, 2} generates a cyclic subgroup of order 2. Two of them generate the
subgroup V of order 4. A 3-cycle and a product of two transpositions generate
the whole group. So there is no subgroup of order 6. Here is the lattice of
subgroups of A4 .

10.2
Normal Subgroups
Another situation where cosets naturally arise is the following. Suppose f : G →
H is a group homomorphism. When do two elements in G have the same image
in H? Well, let α, α′ ∈G, ¯α ∈H with
f(α) = f(α′) = ¯α .
Then
f(α−1α′) = 1H
so that
α−1α′ ∈ker(f)
or
α′ ∈α ker(f) .
Conversely, if f(α) = ¯α and α′ ∈α ker(f) then f(α′) = ¯α. So
f −1(¯α) = α ker(f) .

10.2. NORMAL SUBGROUPS
157
The kernel and its cosets have a special property. The most convenient way
to express it is this: for any α ∈G,
α ker(f)α−1 = ker(f) .
(For β ∈ker f, f(αβα−1) = f(α)f(α−1) = 1H). We give a name to subgroups
with this property.
Definition 10.8. A subgroup K of G is called a normal subgroup, written K ▹G,
if
αKα−1 = K ,
for all α ∈G.
This property can be expressed in terms of the cosets of K.
Theorem 10.9. A subgroup K of  a group G is normal if  and only if
(i) for any α ∈G, αK = Kα, or equivalently,
(ii) for any α, β ∈G, (αK)(βK) = (αβ)K, or equivalently,
(iii) for any α ∈G, αKα−1 ⊂K.
Proof. Suppose that K is a normal subgroup. Take an α ∈G. We have that
αKα−1 = K .
(10.1)
Multiplying on the right by α we get
αK = Kα .
Thus every left coset coincides with the corresponding right coset. In terms of
elements of K this means that for κ ∈K, there exists a λ ∈K, such that
ακ = λα ,

158
CHAPTER 10. COSETS
and vice versa. Now assume that equation (i) holds for all α. Then given α, β ∈
G,
(αK)(βK) = α(Kβ)K = α(βK)K = (αβ)K
So the product of the cosets of α and of β is the coset of αβ. If equation (ii)
holds, then taking β = α−1, we have
(αK)(α−1K) = (αα−1)K = 1 · K = K ,
(10.2)
which implies that
αKα−1 ⊂K
(10.3)
(Why? Well, lying in the set on the left-hand side of (10.2) are all elements of
the form (ακ)(α−11), with κ ∈K). Finally, since equation (10.3) holds for all
elements of G, it holds for α−1:
α−1Kα ⊂K .
Conjugating both sides by α gives
K ⊂αKα−1 ,
and combining this with (10.3) gives equation (10.1).
In practice, to check whether K▹G, you need only verify whether αKα−1 ⊂
K, when α runs through a set of generators of G. In fact it is sufficient to check if
ακα−1 ∈K, where α runs through a set of generators of G and κ runs through
a set of generators of K. In example (10.1), we know that {(1 2 3), (1 2)(3 4)}
generates A4. Since (1 2)(3 4) ∈V , it is enough to check that (1 2 3)V (1 3 2) =
V . We see then that V is a normal subgroup of A4.
Remark 10.10. Any subgroup K of index 2 is normal. There are 2 left cosets: K
and αK, where α ̸∈K. And there are 2 right cosets: K and Kα. The left cosets
are disjoint from one another and so are the right cosets. Therefore αK = Kα,
and K is normal. For example, An is a normal subgroup of Sn, for all n.

10.3. QUOTIENT GROUPS
159
If G is abelian, then every subgroup is normal since αβα−1 = β for any α
and β. The centre of any group is a normal subgroup because the same equation
holds for any α, with β in the centre.
We should also see an example of a subgroup which is not normal. Let G =
S3 and K = ⟨(1 2)⟩. Then (1 2 3)(1 2)(1 3 2) = (2 3) ̸∈K. So K is not
normal.
10.3
Quotient Groups
Condition (ii) in theorem 10.9 tells us that we can make G/K into a group by
multiplying cosets when K is a normal subgroup (and only then). Let's do this
carefully. First, we have a binary operation on G/K:
G/K × G/K →G/K ,
given by
(αK, βK) 7→(αK)(βK) = αβK ,
for α, β ∈G. This operation is associative:
(αKβK)γK = (αβ)KγK = (αβ)γK
= α(βγ)K = αK(βγ)K = αK(βKγK) .
Secondly there is an identity element, namely 1 · K = K:
(αK)K = αK = K(αK) .
Thirdly, the inverse of a coset αK is α−1K:
αKα−1K = (αα−1)K = K = α−1KαK .
G/K with this operation is called the quotient group of G mod K.
You have already seen a quotient group: Z/nZ, the integers mod n, which is
the quotient group of the subgroup nZ. In fact, historically this is the example

160
CHAPTER 10. COSETS
which lead to the general construction. If we look again at example 10.1(iii), we
see that
(
(1 2 3)V
)2 = (1 2 3)V (1 2 3)V = (1 2 3)2V = (1 3 2)V
(
(1 2 3)V
)3 = (1 2 3)V (1 3 2)V = V .
This shows that A4/V is a cyclic group of order 3.
Using Mathematica to generate left cosets and then multiply them together
makes it easy to see the multiplication in G/K in examples where [G : K] is
larger.
10.4
The Canonical Isomorphism
We noted at the beginning of our discussion of normal subgroups, that the kernel
of a homomorphism is normal. In fact every normal subgroup is the kernel of
a homomorphism. For let K be a normal subgroup of a group G. We have a
canonical map
p : G →G/K
given by
p : α 7→αK ,
where α ∈G. By the definition of the group operation in G/K, this map is a
homomorphism:
p(αβ) = αβK = αKβK = p(α)p(β)
for α, β ∈G. It is surjective, and
p(α) = 1G/K = K
if and only if
α ∈K
Thus the kernel of p is K.

10.4. THE CANONICAL ISOMORPHISM
161
Example 10.11. Take G = S4 and K = V . It is easy to check that V is a normal
subgroup of S4. The quotient group S4/V has order 24/4 = 6. We think we
know all groups of order 6. Which one is it? Three of the cosets are written out
in 10.1(iii). The other three are
(1 2)V = {(1 2), (3 4), (1 3 2 4), (1 4 2 3)}
(1 3)V = {(1 3), (2 4), (1 2 3 4), (1 4 3 2)}
(2 3)V = {(2 3), (1 4), (1 2 4 3), (1 3 4 2)} .
Thus the 6 cosets can be written as
V, (1 2)V, (1 3)V, (2 3)V, (1 2 3)V, (1 3 2)V .
We can define a map
S3 →S4/V
by
α 7→αV ,
for α ∈S3. Because of the definition of the group operation in S4/V , this map
is a homomorphism. Since it is bijective, we have
S4/V ∼= S3 .
Here is a more sophisticated way of presenting the same argument. Consider
the subgroup H of S4,
H := {(1), (1 2), (1 3), (2 3), (1 2 3), (1 3 2)} ∼= S3 .
Then H ∩V = {(1)}. So the canonical homomorphism p : S4 →S4/V
is one-to-one on H. Because both H and S4/V have order 6, they are in fact
isomorphic and
S4/V ∼= S3 .
△

162
CHAPTER 10. COSETS
In example 10.15 below we will look at a more complicated example.
In a sense, every homomorphism looks like the canonical homomorphism.
This is what the following theorem says.
Theorem 10.12 (First Isomorphism Theorem). Let f : G →H be a homomor-
phism of  groups. Then f = ¯fp where
p : G →G/ ker(f)
is the canonical homomorphism and
¯f : G/ ker(f) ∼= im(f) .
Proof. As we saw earlier, for any α′ ∈α ker(f) ⊂G
f(α′) = f(α) .
Therefore we get a well-defined mapping
¯f : G/ ker(f) →H
if we set
¯f
(
α ker(f)
)
:= f(α) .
This mapping is a homomorphism because f is one:
¯f
(
α ker(f)β ker(f)
)
= ¯f
(
αβ ker(f)
)
= f(αβ)
= f(α)f(β) = ¯f
(
α ker(f)
) ¯f
(
β ker(f)
)
.
As noted above as well, ¯f is injective: for ¯α = f(α) ∈im(f),
f −1(¯α) = α ker(f) .
And the image of ¯f is just the image of f. So
¯f : G/ ker(f)
∼
=
−→im(f) .

Examples 10.13.
(i) In exercise 5.11 you looked at the exponential homo-
morphism exp : R →S given by
exp(x) = e2πix .
Its kernel is Z and it is surjective. Therefore it induces an isomorphism
exp : R/Z
∼
=→S .
(ii) For any field F we have the homomorphism
det : GL(2, F) →F × .
By definition, its kernel is SL(2, F) and it is surjective. Thus we have an
isomorphism
GL(2, F)/SL(2, F) ∼= F × .
This holds in particular for F = Fp. We know that the order of GL(2, Fp)
is (p −1)2p(p + 1). So we can compute |SL(2, Fp)|:
p−1 = |F ×| = |GL(2, Fp)|/|SL(2, Fp)| = (p−1)2p(p+1)/|SL(2, Fp)|
and therefore
|SL(2, Fp)| = (p −1)p(p + 1) .
(iii) The action of GL(2, Fp) on P(Fp) gave us a homomorphism
fp : GL(2, Fp) →Sp+1 .

164
CHAPTER 10. COSETS
The kernel is Z
(
GL(2, Fp)
) ∼= F ×. The map fp then induces an injective
homomorphism
¯fp : PGL(2, Fp) := GL(2, Fp)/Z
(
GL(2, Fp)
)
→Sp+1 .
PGL(2, Fp) is called the projective linear group. Similarly one defines
PSL(2, Fp) which we shall discuss further in chapter 12.

Software and Calculations
For computing cosets there are functions LeftCosets and RightCosets . They
take as arguments a group G and a subgroup K and produce a list of the elements
of G partitioned into cosets with K itself as the first coset. To illustrate, let's re-
peat example 10.1. We have:
In[1]:= A4 = Group[ P[{1,2,3}], P[{2,3,4}] ]
Out[1]= ⟨(1 2 3), (2 3 4) ⟩
and
In[2]:= V = Group[ P[{1,2},{3,4}], P[{1,3},{2,4}]
]
Out[2]= ⟨(1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4) ⟩
Then
In[3]:= LeftCosets[A4,V]

165
Out[3]= {{(1), (2 1)(4 3), (3 1)(4 2),
(4 1)(3 2)}, {(3 4 2), (2 4 1),
(3 2 1), (4 3 1)}, {(4 3 2), (2 3 1),
(3 4 1), (4 2 1)}}
If you only want a representative from each coset you can use LeftCosetReps
or RightCosetReps:
In[4]:= LeftCosetReps[A4,V]
Out[4]= {(1), (3 4 2), (4 3 2)}
These are just the first elements from each coset. We can check that V satisfies
10.9(i) by computing its right cosets and comparing them with the left cosets:
In[5]:= RightCosets[A4,V]
Out[5]= {{(1), (2 1)(4 3), (3 1)(4 2),
(4 1)(3 2)},{(3 4 2), (3 2 1), (4 3 1),
(2 4 1)}, {(4 3 2), (4 2 1), (2 3 1),
(3 4 1)}}
So you can multiply two cosets together to get a third:
In[6]:= {P[{3, 4, 2}], P[{2, 4, 1}],
P[{3, 2, 1}], P[{4, 3, 1}]}.
{P[{4, 3, 2}], P[{2, 3, 1}],
P[{3, 4, 1}], P[{4, 2, 1}]}
Out[6]= {(1), (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)}

166
CHAPTER 10. COSETS
We can also verify that V is normal in A4 by calculating its conjugates. First we
have the function Conjugate[a,b] which conjugates b by a. For example, if
In[7]:= a = P[{1,2,3}]
Out[7]= (1 2 3)
In[8]:= b = P[{1,4}]
Out[8]= (1 4)
then
In[9]:= Conjugate[a,b]
Out[9]= (2 4)
You can conjugate all the elements of a set by a at once:
In[10]:= Conjugate[ a, Elements[V] ]
Out[10]= {(1), (1 4)(2 3), (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4)}
which confirms that V is normal in A4.
Example 10.14. In S5, we have the subgroup F20 (see exercise 8.20):
In[11]:= F20 = Group[ P[{1,2,3,4,5}] , P[{1,2,4,3}]
]
Out[11]= ⟨(1 2 3 4 5), (1 2 4 3) ⟩

10.5. SOFTWARE AND CALCULATIONS
167
A pair of generators of S5 is
In[12]:= a = P[{1,2,3,4,5}]
b = P[{1,2}]
Out[12]= (1 2 3 4 5)
Out[13]= (1 2)
To check whether F20 is normal in S5 you conjugate the generators of F20 first
by a and then by b and look whether the resulting sets lie in F20. In fact since a
belongs to F20 you need only check
In[14]:= Conjugate[ b, Generators[F20] ]
Out[14]= {(1 3 4 5 2), (1 4 3 2)}
which does not lie in F20. So F20 is not normal.
Example 10.15. Let G72 (see exercise 8.16) be the permutation group
In[15]:= G72 = Group[ P[{1,2,3}], P[{1,4},{2,5},{3,6}],
P[{1,5,2,4},{3,6}] ]
Out[15]= ⟨(1 2 3), (1 4)(2 5)(3 6), (1 5 2 4)(3 6) ⟩
G72 has order 72:
In[16]:= Order[G72]
Out[16]= 72

168
CHAPTER 10. COSETS
Let K be the subgroup
In[17]:= K = Group[ P[{1,2,3}], P[{4,5,6}] ]
Out[17]= ⟨(1 2 3), (4 5 6) ⟩
Since these two 3-cycles commute with one another, K ∼= Z/3Z × Z/3Z. The
first element of the list of generators of G72 is also a generator of K. So to check
that K ▹G72 we need only conjugate the generators of K by the remaining two
generators of G72 :
In[18]:= Conjugate[ P[{1,4},{2,5},{3,6}],
Generators[K] ]
Conjugate[ P[{1,5,2,4},{3,6}],
Generators[K] ]
Out[18]= {(4 5 6), (1 2 3)}
Out[19]= {(4 6 5), (1 2 3)}
Therefore K is a normal subgroup of G72. The quotient group L := G72/K
has order 72/9 = 8. We want to determine which group of order 8 it is. Since
each coset has 9 elements, we will tell Mathematica not to print out the entire list
of cosets when it computes L:
In[20]:= L = LeftCosets[G72, K];
First we look at representatives from each of the cosets.
In[21]:= LeftCosetReps[G72, K]

10.5. SOFTWARE AND CALCULATIONS
169
Out[21]= {(1), (1 2), (4 5), (2 3)(4 5),
(1 4)(2 5)(3 6), (1 4)(2 5 3 6),
(1 4)(2 6 3 5), (1 4)(2 6)(3 5)}
The first coset, L[[1]], is K = 1L. The second, L[[2]] = (1 2)K. Now
(
(1 2)K
)2 = (1 2)2K = K .
In other words, it has order 2. Since the representatives of the cosets L[[3]],
L[[4]], L[[5]] and L[[8]] have order 2 as well, so do the cosets themselves. This
leaves L[[6]] and L[[7]]. We can see that
(
(1 4)(2 5 3 6)
)−1 = (1 4)(2 6 3 5) .
So these two are inverse to each other. Do they in fact have order 4?
In[22]:= L[[6]].L[[6]]
Out[22]= {(2 3)(4 5), (1 2)(4 5), (1 3)(4 5),
(2 3)(5 6), (2 3)(4 6), (1 2)(5 6),
(1 2)(4 6), (1 3)(5 6), (1 3)(4 6)}
Comparing this with our list of coset representatives, we see that this must be
L[[4]], which has order 2. So L[[4]] = L[[6]]2 and L[[7]] = L[[6]]3. It begins to
look as if L might be isomorphic to D4 (see equation (7.1)). To check this, we
need generators σ and τ satisfying
σ4 = 1 ,
τ 2 = 1 ,
στ = τσ−1 .
Let's try σ = L[[6]] and τ = L[[2]]. To see that they generate L we compute
In[23]:= L[[2]].L[[6]]
L[[2]].L[[4]]
L[[2]].L[[7]]

(1 6 3 5 2 4), (1 6)(2 4)(3 5),

Out[24]= {(4 5), (1 2 3)(4 5), (1 3 2)(4 5),
(5 6), (4 6), (1 2 3)(5 6),
(1 2 3)(4 6), (1 3 2)(5 6),

(1 4 3 5 2 6), (1 5 3 6 2 4),

(1 6 2 5 3 4), (1 6 3 4 2 5),
(1 6)(2 5)(3 4)}
Thus
L[[2]].L[[6]] = L[[5]]
L[[2]].L[[6]]2 = L[[2]].L[[4]] = L[[3]]
L[[2]].L[[6]]3 = L[[2]].L[[7]]= L[[8]] .
So L[[6]] and L[[2]] do generate L. Now let's see whether they satisfy the right
relation. We must check whether
L[[6]]−1.L[[2]] = L[[7]].L[[2]] = L[[5]] :
In[26]:= L[[7]].L[[2]

(1 6 3 5 2 4), (1 6)(2 4)(3 5),

L ∼= D4 .

Sylow Subgroups
11.1
The Sylow Theorems
The Sylow subgroups of a finite group G are a class of subgroups which provide
the first clues for discovering the structure of G. We shall see later in this chapter
that the results we obtain about Sylow subgroups are enough to classify groups
of small order.
Definition 11.1. Let G be a group of order apr, where (a, p) = 1. A p-subgroup
of order pr is called a Sylow p-subgroup of G.
In other words, a Sylow p-subgroup is a p-subgroup of the maximal possible
order. For example, |S4| = 24 = 23·3. So a Sylow 2-subgroup is one of order 8,
such as D4. A Sylow 3-subgroup is one of order 3, for example a cyclic subgroup
generated by a 3-cycle. If we consider the permutation group G72 in example
10.15, we have that 72 = 23 · 32. The subgroup H ∼= D4 in exercise 10.16 is a
Sylow 2-subgroup and the subgroup K ∼=
(
Z/3Z
)2 , a Sylow 3-subgroup.
Our first result tells us that for each prime p which divides |G| there exists a
Sylow subgroup. It is a partial converse to Lagrange's theorem. In order to prove
it we need an arithmetic lemma.
Lemma 11.2. Suppose n = apr where (a, p) = 1. Then
(n
pr
)
≡a
(mod p) .
In particular, p does not divide
( n
pr
)
.
175

176
CHAPTER 11. SYLOW SUBGROUPS
Proof. As we saw in exercise 1.4,
(1 + x)p ≡1 + xp
(mod p) .
Arguing by induction,
(1 + x)pr ≡1 + xpr
(mod p) .
Therefore
(1 + x)n =
(
(1 + x)pr)a ≡(1 + xpr)a = 1 + axpr + · · · + xn
(mod p) .
But the coefficient of xpr in the expansion of (1 + x)n is
( n
pr
)
. Therefore
(n
pr
)
≡a
(mod p) .
Theorem 11.3. Let G be a finite group. For each prime p dividing |G| there exists a Sylow
p-subgroup.
Proof. Suppose n := |G| = apr, where (a, p) = 1. Let X be the set of all
subsets of G with pr elements. We know that
|X| =
(n
pr
)
.
Now G acts on X by
(α, T) 7→αT ,
where α ∈G and T ∈X. X decomposes into a disjoint union of orbits of G.
According to the lemma, p does not divide |X|. So from formula 9.2 we see that
the order of at least one of these orbits is not divisible by p. Suppose OT is such
an orbit, and GT the stabilizer of T. By formula 9.1,
|G| = |OT||GT| .

11.1. THE SYLOW THEOREMS
177
Since |G| is divisible by pr, it follows that |GT| is divisible by pr. But for any
τ ∈T, we have GTτ ⊂T, so that
|GT| = |GTτ| ≤|T| = pr .
Therefore
|GT| = pr
and GT is a Sylow p-subgroup.
Remark 11.4. The proof shows that in fact
GTτ = T ,
in other words T is a right coset of the Sylow p-subgroup GT. It also shows that
|OT| = a .
On the other hand, suppose H is any Sylow p-subgroup, and set
T = Hτ ,
for some τ ∈G. Then it is easy to see that GT = H , and therefore |OT| =
|G|/|H| = a . So orbits OT for such T, are precisely the orbits whose length is
prime to p.
Our second result says something about the number of Sylow p-subgroups.
Theorem 11.5. Let np be the number of  Sylow p-subgroups of G. Then
np ≡1
(mod p) .
Proof. As pointed out in the remark above, each orbit of length a consists of right
cosets of Sylow p-subgroups. Cosets of different subgroups are distinct: for if
Hσ = Kτ ,
σ, τ ∈G ,
then
Hστ −1 = K .

178
CHAPTER 11. SYLOW SUBGROUPS
In particular, 1 = β(στ −1) for some β ∈H. It follows that στ −1 = β−1 ∈H,
so that H = K.
We can now count the number of elements of X in such orbits: there are
np Sylow p-subgroups and each one has a cosets. Therefore the total number
of elements of X in these orbits is anp. Since the length of any other orbit is
divisible by p, equation 9.2 shows that
|X| ≡anp
(mod p) .
But according to lemma 11.2,
|X| ≡a
(mod p) .
Therefore since (a, p) = 1,
np ≡1
(mod p) .
If H is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, then so is every conjugate of H. In the
example G = S4, we saw that the Sylow 3-subgroups are cyclic. They are in fact
all conjugate to each other, because all 3-cycles are conjugate in S4. The third
result tells us that this is not a coincidence.
Theorem 11.6. Let G be a finite group. Then its Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to one
another.
Proof. Let H be a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Each left coset of H has pr elements.
Thus the set of left cosets of H, G/H ⊂X. Let K be another Sylow p-subgroup.
We can look at the action of K (by left multiplication) on X and in particular on
G/H. Then G/H decomposes into disjoint K-orbits. Since p does not divide
|G/H|, equation 9.2 again says that there must be an orbit whose order is not
divisible by p. Suppose the coset αH, α ∈G, belongs to such an orbit. By 9.1,
the order of this orbit divides |K| = pr. But this order is not divisible by p. So
it must be 1, in other words,
KαH = αH .

11.1. THE SYLOW THEOREMS
179
This means that for any κ ∈K,
κα · 1 ∈αH ,
or equivalently
α−1κα ∈H .
Therefore α−1Kα ⊂H, and since |K| = |H|, in fact
α−1Kα = H .
Thus any two Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate.
This result suggests another way of counting the number of Sylow
p-subgroups. If we let G act on X by conjugation, then the orbit of a Sylow
p-subgroup H is the set of its conjugates. The stabilizer is the subgroup
NG(H) := {α ∈G | αHα−1 = H} .
NG(H) is called the normalizer of H in G. Clearly H ▹NG(H) and if H ▹G , then
NG(H) = G. Now we can apply 9.1 again to see that the number of conjugates
of H is |G|/|NG(H)| . Since
|G|
|NG(H)| · |NG(H)|
|H|
= |G|
|H| = a ,
it follows that the number of conjugates of H divides a. Therefore:
Corollary 11.7. np divides a.
Examples 11.8.
(i) As we remarked, D4 is a Sylow 2-subgroup of S4:
D4 = {(1), (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3), (1 2 3 4), (1 4 3 2),
(1 3), (2 4)} .
The subgroup
V = {(1), (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)}

180
CHAPTER 11. SYLOW SUBGROUPS
is a normal subgroup of S4. So every conjugate of D4 contains V . Now
{(1 2)(3 4), (1 2 3 4)} generates D4. There are 6 4-cycles, all conjugate
to each other. A pair of them, inverse to each other, occur in D4 and each
of its conjugates. Therefore there are 3 subgroups of S4 conjugate to D4.
This fits with theorem 11.5 and corollary 11.7:
3 ≡1
(mod 2)
and
3 = [S4 : D4] = a .
(ii) In the group G72, K is normal. So it is the only Sylow 3-subgroup. From
theorem 11.5 and corollary 11.7, we know that
n2 ≡1
(mod 2)
and
n2 | 9 .
So n2 = 1, 3 or 9. The Sylow 2-subgroup
H ={(1), (4 5), (1 2), (1 2)(4 5), (1 4)(2 5)(3 6),
(1 4 2 5)(3 6), (1 5 2 4)(3 6), (1 5)(2 4)(3 6)}
is isomorphic to D4, with generators {(1 5 2 4)(3 6), (1 4)(2 5)(3 6)} .
Using Mathematica (see chapter 8), or otherwise, we see that (1 5 2 4)(3 6)
has 18 conjugates in G72, occurring in mutually inverse pairs. Therefore
H has at least 9 conjugates. So n2 = 9.
In the last section we shall see how to find a Sylow 2-subgroup of S8.
11.2
Groups of  Small Order
Theorem 11.9. A group of  order p2, where p is prime, is cyclic or is isomorphic to Z/pZ×
Z/pZ.
Proof. Let G be a group of order p2 and assume that G is not cyclic. According to
theorem 9.7, the centre of G has order at least p. So take an element α ∈Z(G),
α ̸= 1. Then |α| = p. Now pick an element β ̸∈⟨α⟩. Since |β| | p2 and G

11.2. GROUPS OF SMALL ORDER
181
is not cyclic, it follows that |β| = p too. And because α ∈Z(G), αβ = βα.
Therefore the mapping
Z/pZ × Z/pZ →G
given by
(a, b) 7→αaβb , a, b ∈Z/pZ .
is a well-defined homomorphism. This homomorphism is injective. But both
groups have order p2, so it is in fact an isomorphism. Thus G is either cyclic or
isomorphic to
(
Z/pZ
)2.
For example a group of order 9 is either cyclic or isomorphic to
(
Z/3Z
)2. The
next result deals with groups of order 2p.
Theorem 11.10. A group of  order 2p, where p ≥3 is prime, is isomorphic to Z/2pZ or
to Dp.
Proof. Let G be a group of order 2p. Its Sylow p-subgroup has order p and is
therefore cyclic (see corollary 10.5). Similarly, the Sylow 2-subgroup is cyclic of
order 2. So let α be an element of G of order p, and β of order 2. Now np ≡1
(mod p) and np | [G : ⟨α⟩] = 2. This implies that np = 1 and that ⟨α⟩is a
normal subgroup. Therefore
βαβ = αk ,
for some k, 0 < k < p. Conjugating again with β, we get
α = β2αβ2 = βαkβ = (αk)k = αk2 .
Therefore k2 ≡1 (mod p), which means that k = ±1.
Thus there are two cases: first,
βαβ = α ,
which says that α and β commute. But then αβ has order 2p (see exercise 5.7)
and G is cyclic.

182
CHAPTER 11. SYLOW SUBGROUPS
In the second case
βαβ = α−1 .
This is the defining relation for Dp (equation (7.1)). So G is isomorphic to Dp.
In particular, for p = 3 this says again that a group of order 6 is either cyclic or
isomorphic to S3. And for p = 5, it says that a group of order 10 is either cyclic
or isomorphic to D5.
It is time to sort out the groups of order 8.
Theorem 11.11. Let G be a group of  order 8. Then G is isomorphic to D4, Q, Z/8Z ,
Z/4Z × Z/2Z or
(
Z/2Z
)3.
Proof. Suppose that G is not cyclic. Then its non-trivial elements have order 2 or
4. It is not hard to see that if all of these have order 2, then
G ∼=
(
Z/2Z
)3 .
So let α ∈G be an element of order 4. Since the index of ⟨α⟩is 2, ⟨α⟩is a
normal subgroup. Pick an element β ̸∈⟨α⟩. Then
βαβ−1 = αk ,
where k = ±1. If k = 1 then α and β commute and G is abelian. There are two
possibilities: either |β| = 2 or |β| = 4. In the first case, arguing as in the proof
of theorem 11.9 we see that
G ∼= Z/4Z × Z/2Z .
In the second case, we must have that β2 = α2. Therefore |αβ| = 2. So
replacing β by αβ we are back to the first case.
Now suppose that
βαβ−1 = α−1 .

11.2. GROUPS OF SMALL ORDER
183
Thus G is not abelian. If |β| = 2, then the relation tells us that G ∼= D4 (see
equation (7.1)). This leaves us with the case |β| = 4. According to theorem 9.7,
Z(G) is not trivial. It is not hard to see that
|Z(G)| = 2 ,
and that if γ ∈G has order 4, then
Z(G) ⊂⟨γ⟩.
So let ϵ generate Z(G). Then α2 = ϵ , β2 = ϵ , and therefore
(βα)2 = (βα)(α−1β) = β2 = ϵ .
It follows that |βα| = 4. Furthermore,
βα = α−1β = α3β = ϵ(αβ) .
Comparing this with the description of Q in exercise 4.5, we see that G ∼= Q.
The following result is the key to classifying groups of order 12.
Theorem 11.12. Let G be a group of  order 12. Then G has a normal subgroup of  order
3 or G ∼= A4.
Proof. Write 12 = 22 · 3. According to theorem 11.5, n3 ≡1 (mod 3). Accord-
ing to corollary 11.7, n3 divides 4. So n3 = 1 or 4. Suppose that n3 ̸= 1, in
other words that G does not have a normal subgroup of order 3. Let H be one
of the subgroups of order 3. Then G acts on the set of 4 left cosets, G/H, by
multiplication on the left. This defines a homomorphism
σ : G →S4 .
What is the kernel of σ? Well, σ(α) = 1 means that for all β ∈G,
α(βH) = βH .

184
CHAPTER 11. SYLOW SUBGROUPS
Equivalently
β−1αβH = H
or
β−1αβ ∈H
for all β ∈G. But then
α ∈βHβ−1
for all β ∈G. By assumption, H has four distinct conjugates, and the intersec-
tion of two distinct subgroups of order 3 is trivial. Therefore α = 1 and σ is
injective. So G is isomorphic to a subgroup of S4 of order 12, and the only such
subgroup is A4.
With this result it is not hard to classify groups of order 12. It turns out that
up to isomorphism there are 5 groups: Z/12Z, Z/3Z×V , D6, A4 and G12 (see
exercise 4.17).
Example 11.13. Let G be a group of order 15 = 3 · 5. Then n3 ≡1 (mod 3)
and n3 | 5. It follows that n3 = 1. Similarly, n5 ≡1 (mod 5) and n5 | 3. So
n5 = 1 too. Thus G has only one Sylow 3-subgroup and only one Sylow 5-
subgroup and both are normal. Let α be an element of order 3 and β of order
5. Applying exercise 10.8, we see that
αβ = βα .
But then by exercise 5.7,
|αβ| = |α||β| = 15 .
So G is cyclic. Thus every group of order 15 is cyclic.

11.3. A LIST
185
11.3
A List
We can now begin a list, up to isomorphism, of all the groups of very small order.
∗order 1: {1}.
∗order 2: Since 2 is prime, all groups of order 2 are cyclic and therefore iso-
morphic to Z/2Z .
∗order 3: Just as for 2, all groups of order 3 are isomorphic to Z/3Z .
∗order 4: It is easy to see that a group of order 4 is cyclic or isomorphic to V .
Notice that both are abelian.
∗order 5: Z/5Z .
∗order 6: By theorem 11.10, there are two groups of order 6: Z/6Z ∼= Z/2Z×
Z/3Z and S3 . S3 is the smallest non-abelian group.
∗order 7: Z/7Z .
∗order 8: By theorem 11.11 there are five groups of order 8: D4, Q, Z/8Z ,
Z/4Z × Z/2Z and (Z/2Z)3.
∗order 9: From theorem 11.9 we know that every group of order 9 is either
cyclic or isomorphic to
(
Z/3Z
)2 .
∗order 10: By theorem 11.10 any group of order 10 is isomorphic to Z/10Z
or D5 .
∗order 11: Z/11Z .
∗order 12: As mentioned following theorem 11.12 the groups of order 12 are
Z/12Z , Z/3Z × V , D6, A4 and G12 .
∗order 13: Z/13Z .

186
CHAPTER 11. SYLOW SUBGROUPS
∗order 14: Again theorem 11.10 shows that the groups of order 14 are Z/14Z
and D7 .
∗order 15: Example 11.13 shows that all groups of order 15 are cyclic.
Notice that there is no non-abelian group of odd order in this list. Can you find
a non-abelian group of least odd order?
11.4
A Calculation
Let's look at the Sylow subgroups of S8. First factor 8!.
In[1]:= FactorInteger[8!]
Out[1]= {{2,7},{3,2},{5,1},{7,1}}
In other words,
8! = 27 32 5 7 .
The Sylow 5-subgroups and Sylow 7-subgroups are cyclic, generated by 5-cycles
and 7-cycles respectively. A Sylow 3-subgroup is generated by two disjoint 3-
cycles. A Sylow 2-subgroup has order 27 = 128 and is harder to find. The order
of any element in it is a power of 2. So let's begin our list of generators with an
8-cycle, say
(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8) .
If we add an arbitrary 4-cycle we will get a group which is too big. Now the
square of this 8-cycle is
(1 3 5 7)(2 4 6 8) .
So let's take (1 3 5 7) as the second generator.
In[2]:= H = Group[ P[{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}],
P[{1,3,5,7}] ]

11.4. A CALCULATION
187
Out[2]= ⟨(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8), (1 3 5 7) ⟩
In[3]:= Order[H]
Out[3]= 32
So we have to add another element to our list of generators. If we take an arbitrary
2-cycle we will get the whole group S8. But the square of our 4-cycle is
(1 5)(3 7) .
So let's add (1 5) to our set of generators.
In[4]:= H = Group[ P[{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}], P[{1,3,5,7}],
P[{1,5}] ]
Out[4]= ⟨(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8), (1 3 5 7), (1 5) ⟩
In[5]:= Order[H]
Out[5]= 128
We have found a Sylow 2-subgroup!
Theorem 11.5 and corollary 11.7 tell us that the number of Sylow 2-subgroups
is odd and divides 8!/128 = 315. It would nice to know how many there really
are. By the second Sylow theorem all Sylow 2-subgroups are conjugate to one
another. So we must determine the number of subgroups of S8 conjugate to our
subgroup H. The function ConjugateSubgroups will do this. An 8-cycle and
a transposition generate S8:

188
CHAPTER 11. SYLOW SUBGROUPS
In[6]:= S8 = Group[ P[{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}],
P[{1,2}] ]
Out[6]= ⟨(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8), (1 2) ⟩
Then
In[7]:= ConjugateSubgroups[S8, H]
Out[7]= 315

As the table suggests, when the order has many prime factors, there tend to be
many groups of that order. So the order of a group does not tell you very much
about it. Classifying groups in this way is not very enlightening. A better way
to understand groups is to analyze how they are built up out of certain 'building
blocks'. The building blocks are called simple groups.
Definition 12.1. A group G is simple if it has no normal subgroups other than
{1} and G itself.
191

192
CHAPTER 12. SIMPLE GROUPS
We have seen some simple groups already: the groups of prime order. By
Lagrange's theorem they have no non-trivial subgroups at all. To understand
how a group is built out of simple groups, we need the following observation.
Theorem 12.2. Let G be a group and K ▹G. Let p : G →¯G := G/K be
the canonical homomorphism. Then there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between subgroups of G
containing K and subgroups of ¯G given by
H 7→p(H) = H/K ,
where K < H < G. Furthermore H is normal in G if  and only if p(H) is normal in ¯G.
Proof. For any subgroup ¯H < ¯G the set
H := p−1( ¯H) := {α ∈G | p(α) ∈¯H}
is a subgroup of G. For 1 ∈H, so H ̸= ∅. If α ∈H, then p(α) ∈¯H, which
means that p(α−1) = p(α)−1 ∈¯H so that α−1 ∈H. And if α, β ∈H, then
p(αβ) = p(α)p(β) ∈¯H so that αβ ∈H.
Now given
¯H < ¯G, p−1( ¯H) > K and p
(
p−1( ¯H)
)
= ¯H. And if K <
H < G, then p−1(
p(H)
)
= H. Thus the correspondence
H ↔p(H)
is 1-to-1. Suppose H ▹G. Given ¯α ∈¯G, pick α ∈G with p(α) = ¯α. Then
p(H) = p(αHα−1) = p(α)p(H)p(α−1) = ¯αp(H)¯α−1 ,
so that p(H) is normal in ¯G. Conversely, if ¯H ▹¯G and α ∈G, then
p
(
α p−1( ¯H)α−1)
= p(α) ¯Hp(α)−1 = ¯H .
Therefore α p−1( ¯H)α−1 = p−1( ¯H) and p−1( ¯H) ▹G.
Now we can see how a finite group G is built up from simple groups. Let H1
be a non-trivial proper normal subgroup which is as large as possible. In other

12.1. COMPOSITION SERIES
193
words, there should be no proper normal subgroup containing H1. Then G/H1
has no non-trivial proper normal subgroups and is therefore simple. Next, pick
a non-trivial proper normal subgroup H2 of H1 which is as large as possible.
Again, by the theorem above, H1/H2 is simple. Continue in this way until you
have a non-trivial subgroup Hn−1 which is simple itself. This will happen because
the orders of the subgroups H1, H2, . . . are strictly decreasing. This descending
sequence of subgroups describes how G is built up out of simple groups.
Definition 12.3. A composition series for a group G is a sequence of subgroups
G = H0 ◃H1 ◃· · · ◃Hn−1 ◃Hn = {1}
where Hi/Hi+1 is a simple group for 0 ≤i < n. The quotient groups Hi/Hi+1
are called composition factors of G.
For example, let's write down a composition series for S4. We have A4 ▹S4
and V ▹A4. Since V ∼= Z/2Z × Z/2Z we have one more term, Z/2Z ▹V .
Thus our composition series is
S4 ◃A4 ◃V ◃Z/2Z ◃{1} .
(12.1)
The composition factors are
S4/A4 ∼= Z/2Z
A4/V ∼= Z/3Z
V
/
(Z/2Z) ∼= Z/2Z
Z/2Z .
A composition series for S5 is
S5 ◃A5 ◃{1} .
That's all, because we saw in exercise 10.22 that A5 is a simple group.
Theorem 12.4 (Jordan - H¨older). Let G be a finite group. Then G has a composition
series. The composition factors are unique in the following sense. If
G = H0 ◃H1 ◃· · · ◃Hm−1 ◃Hm = {1}

194
CHAPTER 12. SIMPLE GROUPS
and
G = K0 ◃K1 ◃· · · ◃Kn−1 ◃Kn = {1}
are two composition series for G, then m = n and the composition factors are the same up to
permutation, that is there is a permutation σ of {1, 2, . . . , n} such that
Hi/Hi+1 ∼= Kσ(i)/Kσ(i+1) ,
for 0 ≤i < n.
We have seen that composition series exist, but shall not prove that they
are unique. Clearly it becomes important to know what the simple groups are.
We shall show that two families of groups are simple: An , for n ≥5, and
PSL(2, Fp), for p prime, p > 2. That An is simple will be used in chapter
20 to prove that in general a polynomial equation of degree 5 or more cannot be
solved by radicals.
12.2
Simplicity of An
We know that A3, which is cyclic of order 3, is simple, and that A4 is not. In
exercise 10.22 we saw that A5 is simple. In fact, for all n ≥5, An is simple. First
we show that An is generated by the set of all 3-cycles (cf. exercise 3.12).
Theorem 12.5. The set of 3-cycles generates An, n ≥3.
Proof. By definition, an even permutation can be written as a product of an even
number of transpositions. So it is sufficient to show that a product α of two
transpositions is a product of 3-cycles. Now there are two possibilities for α.
Either the two transpositions have a symbol in common or they do not:
α = (i j)(j k)
or
α = (i j)(k l)

12.2. SIMPLICITY OF AN
195
Now
(i j)(j k) = (i j k) ,
and
(i j)(k l) = (i j)(j k)(j k)(k l) = (i j k)(j k l) .
So α is indeed a product of 3-cycles and therefore any even permutation is a
product of 3-cycles.
Suppose that N ▹An. What we shall do is to prove that N must contain
all the 3-cycles and therefore be An. The following lemma tells us that if one
3-cycle belongs to N, then all of them do.
Lemma 12.6. Suppose that N ▹An, n ≥5, which contains one 3-cycle. Then N
contains all 3-cycles. Equivalently, the 3-cycles form a single conjugacy class in An.
Proof. Suppose that the 3-cycle (i j k) ∈N. Since n ≥5, there exist l, m ≤n
different from i, j, k. Now let α be any other 3-cycle. As we saw in theorem 8.6,
there exists a permutation β ∈Sn such that
βαβ−1 = (i j k) .
If β is even, then we are done. Otherwise we can replace β by (l m)β , since
(l m)βαβ−1(l m) = (l m)(i j k)(l m) = (i j k) .
So we want to show that N contains a 3-cycle. To do this we look at commuta-
tors γ = αβα−1β−1, where α ∈N and β ∈An (see also exercise 13.12). Since
N is normal, βα−1β−1 ∈N, and therefore γ ∈N.
Theorem 12.7. The alternating groups An, for n ̸= 4 are simple.
Proof. Since A3 is cyclic of order 3, it is simple. So we can assume that n ≥5. We
now proceed by induction on n. In exercise 10.22 we saw that A5 is simple. So let

196
CHAPTER 12. SIMPLE GROUPS
n be greater than 5 and assume that Ar is simple for all r < n. Let N be a non-
trivial normal subgroup of An. An acts on {1, 2, . . . , n} and the stabilizer of any
number is isomorphic to An−1. So for any s, the stabilizer Ns is isomorphic to a
normal subgroup of An−1. If Ns is not trivial, then by the induction assumption
it must be isomorphic to An−1 itself. In particular it contains a 3-cycle. Therefore
N contains a 3-cycle. Then lemma 12.6 proves that N contains all 3-cycles. But
according to theorem 12.5, the set of 3-cycles generates An. Therefore N = An.
It remains to convince ourselves that for some s, Ns is not trivial. Suppose
α ∈N, α ̸= 1. If β ∈An is a 3-cycle then αβα−1 is a 3-cycle too. Therefore
the commutator γ = αβα−1β−1 ∈N is a product of two 3-cycles. Suppose
that
γ = (h i j)(k l m) .
If h, i, j, k, l, m are not distinct then since n ≥6, γ has a fixed point s and thus
Ns is not trivial. If they are distinct, let δ = (i j k). Then
ϵ = γδγ−1δ−1 = (i k h l j) .
Now ϵ ∈N too and it does have a fixed point, namely m. So Nm is not trivial.
We have shown therefore that An is simple and by the principle of induction,
the theorem is proved.
12.3
Simplicity of PSL(2, Fp)
Another family of groups which we can prove are simple is PSL(2, Fp), for p
prime. In chapter 4 we computed generators for SL(2, Fp). The first step is to
refine this result.
Theorem 12.8. SL(2, Fp) is generated by
{(1
1
0
1
)
,
( 0
1
−1
0
)}

12.3. SIMPLICITY OF PSL(2, FP )
197
or equivalently, by
{(1
1
0
1
)
,
(1

1
1
)}
.
Proof. We have the relations
(0

) (1

)
=
( 0

)
(12.3)
as in chapter 4. These tell us that if one pair of matrices generates SL(2, Fp),
then so does the other. According to exercise 4.8 all we need to show is that we
can write
(c
0
0
c−1
)
, c ∈F×
p ,
in terms of these matrices. Now for any a, b ∈Fp, we have
(1
0
b
1
) (1
a
0
1
)
=
(1
a
b
1 + ab
)
.
Taking a = 1, b = c−1 −1 gives us the matrix
(
1

c−1 −1
c−1
)
.
Taking a = −c−1, b = c −1 gives us the matrix
(
1
−c−1
c −1
c−1
)
.
If we multiply these two together we have
(
1

c−1 −1
c−1
) (
1
−c−1
c −1
c−1
)
=
(c

.
Therefore the pair
{(1

)
,
(1

1
1
)}
generates SL(2, Fp).

198
CHAPTER 12. SIMPLE GROUPS
Remark 12.9. For convenience, write G := SL(2, Fp). In chapter 8 we saw that
G acts on P(Fp) by fractional linear transformations. From the proof of theorem
8.7 it follows that
H := G0 ∩G∞=
{(c
0
0
c−1
) c ∈F×
p
}
.
If we pick a c ∈F×
p and set
δ =
(c
0
0
c−1
)
.
then the corresponding fractional linear transformation is given by
sδ(x) = c2x .
Theorem 12.10. For p > 3, the groups PSL(2, Fp) are simple.
Proof. Let ¯N ▹PSL(2, Fp) be a non-trivial subgroup, and N ▹SL(2, Fp) be
its inverse image under SL(2, Fp) →PSL(2, Fp), (see theorem 12.2). We want
to show that N = G. To do this we shall show that
τ :=
(1
1
0
1
)
∈N .
(12.4)
Why will this do the trick? Well, since N is normal, relation (12.2) above tells us
that
( 1
0
−1
1
)
∈N
and therefore by theorem 12.8, N = SL(2, Fp).
We will prove (12.4) by showing that
(i) N acts transitively on P(Fp);
(ii) N∞acts transitively on P(Fp) \ {∞}.
The first statement tells us that p + 1 divides |N| and the second that p di-
vides |N∞| and therefore |N| as well. So p(p + 1) divides |N|. Now |G| =
(p −1)p(p + 1)
(
see 10.13(ii)
)
. Therefore |G/N| divides p −1. In particular,

12.3. SIMPLICITY OF PSL(2, FP )
199
( |G/N| , p) = 1 . But |τ| = p . So the order of ¯τ in G/N must divide p. This
is only possible if ¯τ = ¯1, in other words, τ ∈N.
First we show that N is transitive on P(Fp). So given c ∈P(Fp), we must
find a γ ∈N such that
sγ(0) = c .
Since ¯N ̸= {1}, there exists α ∈N with sα ̸= 1. Thus for some a ∈P(Fp),
b := sα(a) ̸= a .
Since G is doubly transitive (see exercise 8.25), there exists β ∈G with
sβ(a) = 0 ,
sβ(b) = c .
If we set γ = βαβ−1 ∈N, then
sγ(0) = sβsαs−1
β (0) = c .
Thus N is transitive on P(Fp).
Secondly, we prove that N∞is transitive on P(Fp)\{∞}. We will do this by
showing that the orbit of 0 has length p. First let's check that N∞is not trivial.
Take α ∈N such that
sα(0) = ∞.
(12.5)
Then for any δ ∈H = G0 ∩G∞,
sδαδ−1(0) = ∞.
Since δαδ−1 ∈N, there is more than one element in N satisfying (12.5). Let β
be a second such element. It follows that αβ−1 ∈N∞and αβ−1 ̸= 1. Now
pick a γ ∈N∞, γ ̸= 1. Then for
δ =
(c
0
0
c−1
)
, c ∈F×
p ,
we have
sδγδ−1(0) = c2sγ(0) .

200
CHAPTER 12. SIMPLE GROUPS
If necessary, by replacing γ with αγα−1 for a suitably chosen α ∈G∞, we
can assure that sγ(0) ̸= 0. Now there are (p −1)/2 squares in F×
p (see exercise
10.21). So O0, the orbit of 0 under N∞, must have length at least (p−1)/2+1 =
(p + 1)/2. We know that
|O0|
 |N∞|
 |G∞| = (p −1)p
Since (p + 1)/2 does not divide p −1 , it follows that |O0| = p . In other words
N∞is transitive on P(Fp) \ {∞}.

Abelian Groups
As we have seen, finite groups, even small ones, are complicated and very difficult
to classify. However abelian groups are quite a different story. As we shall see
it is not hard to classify finite abelian groups, or even finitely generated abelian
groups. This is the goal of this chapter.
13.1
Free Abelian Groups
Recall that a group G is finitely generated if there is a finite subset g ⊂G such that
G = ⟨g⟩. In this chapter, all groups will be abelian and finitely generated. As is
usual in abelian groups, we shall write the group operation as addition.
Definition 13.1. A set of generators g = {α1, . . . , αn} of a finitely generated
abelian group G is called a basis of G if there are no non-trivial relations among
the elements of g, in other words
a1α1 + · · · + anαn = 0
for a1, . . . , an ∈Z, implies that
a1 = · · · = an = 0 .
If there exists a basis for G, then G is called a free abelian group.
For example, Zn has the basis {ϵ1, . . . , ϵn} where
ϵi = (0, . . . , 0, 1
i, 0, . . . , 0)
203

204
CHAPTER 13. ABELIAN GROUPS
for 1 ≤i ≤n, and is thus a free abelian group. On the other hand, Z/nZ is not
free, because every element α satisfies
nα = 0 .
In fact since a free group is infinite, no finite abelian group is free. In general if
G is an abelian group, set
Gt = {α ∈G | nα = 0, for some n ∈Z} .
It is easy to see that Gt is a subgroup of G, called the torsion subgroup of G.
One consequence of the classification theorem will be that
G ∼= Gfr × Gt ,
where Gfr is a free subgroup of G.
Every finitely generated free abelian group is isomorphic to Zn for some n.
Why is this so? Suppose G has a basis {α1, . . . , αn}. Define a mapping
f : Zn →G
by
f(a1, . . . , an) := a1α1 + · · · + anαn .
This mapping is clearly a homomorphism, and is surjective since α1, . . . , αn
generate G. Suppose f(a1, . . . , an) = 0 for some (a1, . . . , an) ∈Zn. So
a1α1 + · · · + anαn = 0
Then since there are no non-trivial relations among α1, . . . , αn , we have a1 =
· · · = an = 0. Thus f is injective.
It is not hard to see that for m ̸= n, Zm ̸∼= Zn. Therefore any two bases of
a free abelian group have the same number of elements.
Definition 13.2. The rank of a free abelian group is the number of elements in
a basis of the group.

13.1. FREE ABELIAN GROUPS
205
Now let's return to an arbitrary finitely generated abelian group G with gen-
erators g = {α1, . . . , αn}. Then as above, we have a homomorphism
f : Zn →G
given by
f : (a1, . . . , an) 7→a1α1 + · · · + anαn ,
(13.1)
which is surjective. Its kernel is a subgroup of Zn. By describing the kernel
precisely, we shall get a description of G. The first step is the following theorem.
Theorem 13.3. A subgroup of  a free abelian group of  rank n is free, of  rank at most n.
Proof. We prove the theorem by induction on n. For n = 0 there is nothing to
prove. So assume that the result holds for any subgroup of a free group of rank
less than n. Let G be a free group with basis {α1, . . . , αn}, and H a subgroup
of G. Set
G1 = ⟨α2, . . . , αn⟩
The inclusion H ↩→G induces a homomorphism
g : H →G/G1 ∼= Zα1 ∼= Z .
Now
ker g = H ∩G1 ,
so the induced homomorphism
¯g : H/(H ∩G1) →G/G1 ∼= Z
is injective. Therefore, by exercise 6.11, H/H ∩G1 is cyclic, and in fact,
H/(H ∩G1) ∼= a1(Zα1) ,
for some a1 ∈Z, a1 ≥0. Pick an element β1 ∈H such that ¯β1 generates
H/H ∩G1. We can assume that it is of the form
β1 = a1α1 + β ∈H ,

206
CHAPTER 13. ABELIAN GROUPS
for some β ∈H∩G1. Since the rank of G1 is n−1, by the induction assumption
H ∩G1 is free and of rank at most n −1. Let {β2, . . . , βm}, m ≤n, be a basis
of H ∩G1. We want to show that {β1, β2, . . . , βm} is a basis of H. First we
check that it generates H. Given an element γ ∈H, we know that
¯γ = b1 ¯β1 ∈H/(H ∩G1) ,
for some b1 ∈Z. Therefore γ −bβ1 ∈H ∩G1 and so
γ −b1β1 = b2β2 + · · · + bmβm
for some b2, . . . bm ∈Z. Thus
γ = b1β1 + b2β2 + · · · + bmβm ,
and {β1, . . . , βm} generates H.
Now suppose
b1β1 + b2β2 + · · · + bmβm = 0 ,
for some b1, . . . , bm ∈Z. Then in H/(H ∩G1),
b1 ¯β1 = 0 ,
which means that b1 = 0 since H/(H ∩G1) is free. But then
b2β2 + · · · + bmβm = 0 .
Since {β2, . . . , βm} is a basis of H ∩G1, we have that
b2 = · · · = bm = 0
as well. Therefore {β1, . . . , βm} is a basis of H. By the principle of induction,
the result then holds for all n.
In particular, this shows that the kernel of the homomorphism f, defined in
(13.1) above, is a free subgroup of Zn. Suppose {β1, . . . , βm} ⊂Zn is a basis
of ker f. We can write
βj =
n
∑
i=1
aijϵi ,

13.2. ROW AND COLUMN REDUCTION OF INTEGER MATRICES
207
for some aij ∈Z. If we let A = (aij) ∈M(n, m, Z), then we have the sequence
of homomorphisms
Zm
A
−→Zn
f
−→G ,
with
ker f = ⟨β1, . . . , βm⟩= im A .
Thus
G ∼= Zn/ im A .
In the next section, we shall show that there is a basis {α1, . . . , αn} of Zn such
that {d1α1, . . . , dmαm} is a basis of ker f, where d1, . . . , dm ∈Z and d1 | · · · |
dm. This will give us our first classification theorem.
13.2
Row and Column Reduction of  Integer
Matrices
Suppose that G is a free abelian group of rank n with basis {α1, . . . , αn}, and
H is a subgroup of rank m ≤n with basis {β1, . . . , βm}. Write
βj =
n
∑
i=1
aijαi ,
(13.2)
for some aij ∈Z, 1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤j ≤m. Let A = (aij) ∈M(n, m, Z). Our
goal is to diagonalize A using integral row and column operations. The algorithm
in fact applies to an arbitrary n × m integer matrix. First, let's list the elementary
operations.
(i) Multiply row (column) i by −1.
(ii) Interchange rows (columns) i and j.
(iii) Add a times row (column) i to row (column) j, where a ∈Z.

208
CHAPTER 13. ABELIAN GROUPS
As with real row and column operations, these integer operations correspond
to multiplication on the left or right by elementary matrices. To obtain the corre-
sponding elementary matrix, apply the operation to the n × n or m × m identity
matrix. Row operations change the basis of G, and column operations, the basis
of H.
Now we diagonalize A. First, pick an entry of A of minimal size. By in-
terchanging a row and a column, move it to the position (1, 1). If necessary,
multiply by −1 to make it non-negative. Divide each entry in row 1 by a11. If
a remainder is not 0, then move that entry to the position (1, 1). Continue until
all entries in row 1, except the first are 0. Do the same with column 1. We now
have a matrix of the form 




a11
0
· · ·
0
0
a22
· · ·
a2m
...
...
...
...
0
an2
· · ·
anm





We also want a11 to divide all other entries. Suppose that there is an entry in
row i which is not divisible by a11. Add row i to row 1. Then proceed as before
to make all other entries in row 1, 0. Continuing in this way, we end up with an
entry in position (1, 1) which divides all other entries in A.
Now apply the same procedure to the (n −1) × (m −1) matrix remaining.
Applying row and column operations will leave the entries divisible by a11. We
end up with a matrix of the form
B =



where di ≥0, for 1 ≤i ≤m, and
d1 | d2 | · · · | dm .

13.2. ROW AND COLUMN REDUCTION OF INTEGER MATRICES
209
Furthermore,
B = PAQ ,
where P ∈M(n, Z) and Q ∈M(m, Z) are invertible. Thus we have proved:
Theorem 13.4. Let A ∈M(n, m, Z). Then there exist invertible matrices P ∈
M(n, Z) and Q ∈M(m, Z) such that B = PAQ is a diagonal matrix with non-
negative diagonal entries d1 | d2 | · · · | dm.
Now these numbers d1, . . . , dm are in fact invariants of A, that is they do
not depend on how A is diagonalized. To see this, we will show that they can
be expressed in terms of the minors of A. For any matrix A ∈M(n, m, Z),
let δk = δk(A) be the greatest common divisor of the k × k minors of A, for
1 ≤k ≤m.
Lemma 13.5. Suppose that P ∈M(n, Z) and Q ∈M(m, Z) are invertible. Then
δ1, . . . , δm are the same for A and for PAQ.
Proof. The rows of PA are integral linear combinations of the rows of A. So for
any k, 1 ≤k ≤m, the k ×k minors of PA are linear combinations of the k ×k
minors of A. Therefore the greatest common divisor of the k × k minors of
A divides all the k × k minors of PA, and thus divides their greatest common
divisor. Now A = P −1(PA). So, reversing the roles of A and PA, the same
argument shows that δk(PA) divides δk(A). Thus
δk(PA) = δk(A) .
Multiplying PA on the right by Q has a similar effect: the columns of PAQ
are linear combinations of the columns of PA. So by an argument similar to the
one we have just made, we see that
δk(PAQ) = δk(PA) .
Therefore,
δk(PAQ) = δk(A) ,
as claimed.

210
CHAPTER 13. ABELIAN GROUPS
If B ∈M(n, m, Z) is a diagonal matrix with non-negative diagonal entries
d1 | d2 | · · · | dm, then
δk = d1 · · · dk ,
for 1 ≤k ≤m. Equivalently,
dk = δk/δk−1 ,
for k > 1, provided δk−1 ̸= 0, and d1 = δ1. We can now prove that d1, . . . , dm
are invariants of A.
Theorem 13.6. Let A ∈M(n, m, Z). Suppose we diagonalize A and obtain a diagonal
matrix with diagonal entries d1 | d2 | · · · | dm. If  we diagonalize A in a different way, we
will obtain the same diagonal matrix.
Proof. The lemma shows that the invariants δ1, . . . , δm are the same for A and
PAQ, for any invertible P ∈M(n, Z) and Q ∈M(m, Z). Diagonalizing A
means finding such P and Q so that PAQ is diagonal. So regardless of how
we diagonalize A, the resulting diagonal matrices will have the same invariants
δ1, . . . , δm. But as we have seen these determine the diagonal entries of the
resulting diagonal matrices.
Let's now return to the matrix A given by equation (13.2). In this case it has
rank m. The matrix P transforms our original basis {α1, . . . , αn} of G into a
basis {γ1, . . . , γn} of G such that
{d1γ1, . . . , dmγm}
is a basis of H. This proves the following result.
Theorem 13.7. Let G be a free abelian group of  rank n and H a subgroup. Then there
exists a basis {α1, . . . , αn} of G and positive integers d1 | · · · | dm, for some m ≤n,
such that
{d1α1, . . . , dmαm}
is a basis of H.

Classification Theorems
We can now state the first classification theorem for finitely generated abelian
groups.

212
CHAPTER 13. ABELIAN GROUPS
Theorem 13.9. Let G be a finitely generated abelian group. There exist d1, . . . , dm ∈N,
with d1 | d2 | · · · | dm, and r ≥0, such that
G ∼= Z/d1Z × · · · × Z/dmZ × Zr .
Proof. To show the existence of such a decomposition, we need only put together
what we have discussed in the previous two sections. Let {α1, . . . , αn} be a set
of generators of G. Define f : Zn →G by
f : (a1, . . . , an) 7→a1α1 + · · · + anαn .
This map is surjective and therefore
G ∼= Zn/ ker f .
By theorem 13.7, there exists a basis {β1, . . . , βn} of Zn and natural numbers
d1, . . . , dm with d1 | · · · | dm such that {d1β1, . . . , dmβm} is a basis of ker f.
Therefore
G ∼= Z/d1Z × · · · × Z/dmZ × Zr
with r = n −m.
For example, let A be the matrix in example 13.8, and let G = Z4/ im A.
Then
G ∼= Z/2Z × Z/6Z × Z .
Corollary 13.10. The torsion subgroup
Gt ∼= Z/d1Z × · · · × Z/dmZ ,
and G/Gt is free of  rank r.
This shows that r is an invariant of G. We define the rank of G to be the rank
of G/Gt. In the next section we shall show that d1, . . . , dm are also invariants,
called the elementary divisors of G.
Suppose we want to use the elementary divisors to classify finite abelian
groups of a given order d. How do we do this? The key is the two conditions:

13.3. CLASSIFICATION THEOREMS
213
(i) d1 | d2 | · · · | dm ,
(ii) d1d2 · · · dm = d .
For example, let's classify abelian groups of order 72. We have
72 = 23 · 32 .
Since d1 divides all the other elementary divisors, each prime factor of d1 does
as well. No prime factor of 72 occurs with multiplicity greater than 3. So there
can be at most 3 elementary divisors. Begin with m = 1. The only possibility is
d1 = 72 .
Next, consider m = 2. We must write
72 = d1d2 ,
with
d1 | d2 .
The possibilities are
72 = 2 · 36
72 = 3 · 24
72 = 6 · 12 .
Lastly, let m = 3. We are looking for factorizations
72 = d1d2d3 ,
where
d1 | d2 | d3 .
The only possibilities are
72 = 2 · 6 · 6
72 = 2 · 2 · 18 .
So there are 6 abelian groups of order 72.
One can also decompose a finite abelian group into a product of cyclic groups
of prime power order. This is our second classification theorem.

214
CHAPTER 13. ABELIAN GROUPS
Theorem 13.11. Let G be a finitely generated abelian group. Then
G ∼= (Z/p1Z)k1 × · · · × (Z/pmZ)km × Zr ,
where p1, . . . , pm are primes and k1, . . . , km ∈N.
Proof. Because of theorem 13.9 we need only show that for any d ∈N, d > 1,
Z/dZ ∼= (Z/p1Z)k1 × · · · × (Z/plZ)kl ,
(13.3)
where p1, . . . , pl are prime numbers. Well, write
d = pk1
1 · · · pkl
l
where p1, . . . , pl are distinct primes, and k1, . . . , kl ∈N. Then by example
5.9(ii), (13.3) holds.
Example 13.12. For comparison, let's use this theorem to list the abelian groups
of order 72. Again we have
72 = 23 · 32 .
The abelian groups of order 8 are
(Z/2Z)3 ,
Z/2Z × Z/4Z ,
Z/8Z .
Those of order 9 are
(Z/3Z)2 ,
Z/9Z .
So we have the 6 groups:
(i) (Z/2Z)3 × (Z/3Z)2 ∼= Z/2Z × (Z/6Z)2
(ii) (Z/2Z)3 × Z/9Z ∼= (Z/2Z)2 × Z/18Z
(iii) Z/2Z × Z/4Z × (Z/3Z)2 ∼= Z/6Z × Z/12Z
(iv) Z/2Z × Z/4Z × Z/9Z ∼= Z/4Z × Z/18Z ∼= Z/2Z × Z/36Z
(v) Z/8Z × (Z/3Z)2 ∼= Z/24Z × Z/3Z
(vi) Z/8Z × Z/9Z ∼= Z/72Z.

13.4. INVARIANCE OF ELEMENTARY DIVISORS
215
13.4
Invariance of  Elementary Divisors
In this section we shall show that the elementary divisors of an abelian group are
invariants of the group. First we set up the basic tool we shall use.
Let G be an abelian group. For any a ∈Z,
aG := {aα | α ∈G}
is a subgroup of G. We are particularly interested in pjG, where p is prime. Now
the quotient group G/pG is naturally a vector space over the field Fp. We just
need to define scalar multiplication. Let
(a + pZ)(α + pG) := aα + pG .
This is clearly well-defined, and makes G/pG into an Fp-vector space. For ex-
ample, if
G = (Z/3Z) × (Z/9Z) ,
then
G/3G ∼= (F3)2 .
Since p(pj)G = pj+1G, the quotient group
pjG/pj+1G
is an Fp-vector space as well. The key to our proof that the elementary divisors
are invariants is the following lemma.
Lemma 13.13. Let G = Z/dZ , for d ∈N. Then for p prime,
dimFp pjG/pj+1G =
{
0 ,
if pj+1 ∤d ,
1 ,
if pj+1 | d .
Proof. First suppose that pj+1 ∤d. Then
(pj+1, d) = pk = (pj, d) ,

CHAPTER 13. ABELIAN GROUPS
for some k ≤j. Therefore in G,
|¯pj| = d/(pj, d) = d/pk = d/(pj+1, d) = |¯pj+1|
(exercise 5.6). Now ¯pj = pj · ¯1 is a generator of pjG. So this tells us that ¯pj+1 is
as well, and therefore
pjG/pj+1G = 0 .
However, if pj+1 | d, then (pj+1, d) = pj+1, whereas (pj, d) = pj. Thus
|¯pj| = d/pj
and
|¯pj+1| = d/pj+1 .
Therefore
pjG/pj+1G ∼= Z/pZ ,
and
dimFp pjG/pj+1G = 1 .
For example, if d = 12, then
G = Z/12Z ∼= Z/4Z × Z/3Z ,
and we have
G/2G ∼= (Z/12Z)
/
(2Z/12Z) ∼= Z/2Z
⇔
dimF2 G/2G = 1
2G/4G ∼= (2Z/12Z)
/
(4Z/12Z) ∼= Z/2Z
⇔
dimF2 2G/4G = 1
4G/8G ∼= (Z/3Z)
/
(Z/3Z)

⇔
dimF2 4G/8G = 0

(3Z/12Z) ∼= Z/3Z
⇔
dimF3 G/3G = 1
3G/9G ∼= (Z/4Z)
/
(Z/4Z)
∼= 0
⇔
dimF3 3G/9G = 0
We are now ready to prove that the elementary divisors are invariants.
Theorem 13.14. Suppose that
Z/d1Z × · · · × Z/dmZ × Zr ∼= G ∼= Z/e1Z × · · · × Z/enZ × Zs
where d1 | · · · | dm and e1 | · · · | en. Then r = s, m = n, and d1 = e1, . . . ,
dm = em.

13.4. INVARIANCE OF ELEMENTARY DIVISORS
217
Proof. From Corollary 13.10, we see that r = s and
Z/d1Z × · · · × Z/dmZ ∼= Gt ∼= Z/e1Z × · · · × Z/enZ .
Pick a prime number p. By the lemma,
dimFp Gt/pGt ≤m .
Furthermore,
dimFp Gt/pGt = m
if p | d1, since this implies that p | dk for all k. In particular,
m = max
p
dimFp Gt/pGt .
The same holds for n. Therefore m = n.
Now for any prime, and any j ≥0,
l := dim pjGt/pj+1Gt
is the number of dk such that pj+1 divides dk. Keeping in mind that if pj+1
divides dk, then it also divides dk+1, . . . , dm, this tells us that
pj+1 ∤d1, . . . , dm−l
but
pj+1 | dm−l+1, . . . , dm .
So these dimensions determine the prime factorization of d1, . . . , dm. The same
holds for e1, . . . , em. Therefore
d1 = e1, . . . , dm = em .
For example, suppose that G is a finite abelian group with
dimF2 G/2G = 7
(13.4)
dimF2 2G/4G = 4
(13.5)
dimF2 4G/8G = 2
(13.6)
dimF2 8G/16G = 1
(13.7)
dimFp G/pG = 0 ,

218
CHAPTER 13. ABELIAN GROUPS
for p ̸= 2. Then we know that the number of elementary divisors is m = 7.
Furthermore, (13.4) implies that 2 divides all of them, (13.5) that 4 divides d4,
d5, d6 and d7, (13.6) that 8 divides d6 and d7, and (13.7) that 16 divides d7.
Therefore
d1 = d2 = d3 = 2 ,
d4 = d5 = 4 ,
d6 = 8 ,
d7 = 16 .
So
G = (Z/2Z)3 × (Z/4Z)2 × Z/8Z × Z/16Z .
13.5
The Multiplicative Group of  the Integers
Mod n
An interesting class of abelian groups are the multiplicative groups (Z/nZ)×.
How do they decompose? First, recall that if n = pk1
1 · · · pkm
m , with p1, . . . , pm
distinct primes, then
Z/nZ ∼= Z/pk1
1 Z × · · · × Z/pkm
m Z
(see example 5(ii)). It is easy to see that
(Z/nZ)× ∼= (Z/pk1
1 Z)× × · · · × (Z/pkm
m Z)× .
(see exercise 5.24).
The question is then: for p prime, k ∈N, what does
(Z/pkZ)× look like ?
First we introduce the p-adic expansion of a natural number a.
Theorem 13.15. Any a ∈N has a unique p-adic expansion
a = a0 + a1p + · · · + akpk ,
where 0 ≤ai < p, for all i.

13.5. THE MULTIPLICATIVE GROUP OF THE INTEGERS MOD N
219
Proof. First we show that such an expansion exists. Pick the smallest k such that
pk+1 > a and argue by induction on k. If k = 0 take a0 = a and we are finished.
Suppose that the result holds for k −1, i.e., any a < pk has such an expansion.
Divide a by pk:
a = akpk + b ,
where 0 ≤b < pk. Since pk+1 > a, we have ak < p. By assumption, we can
write
b = a0 + · · · + ak−1pk−1 .
Therefore
a = a0 + · · · + ak−1pk−1 + akpk ,
and by the principle of induction, the result holds for all k. This argument also
shows that k and ak, . . . , a1 are uniquely determined, and gives an algorithm for
computing them.
For example, take a = 744 and p = 7. The smallest k for which 7k > 744
is k = 4. So we divide 744 by 73:
744 = 2 · 73 + 58 .
Then we divide 58 by 72, and so on:
744 = 2 · 73 + 58
= 2 · 73 + 72 + 9
= 2 · 73 + 72 + 7 + 2 .
We can describe (Z/pkZ)× using p-adic expansions. Any element in (Z/pkZ)×
can be represented by a unique integer a, 0 < a < pk, which is prime to p. If we
write
a = a0 + a1p + · · · + ak−1pk−1 ,
(13.8)
then (a, p) = 1 if and only if a0 ̸= 0. Counting such integers, we see that
|(Z/pkZ)×| = (p −1)pk−1 .

220
CHAPTER 13. ABELIAN GROUPS
Now (Z/pkZ)× has a distinguished subgroup. For p > 2, let
Upk = ker[(Z/pkZ)× →(Z/pZ)×] ,
where the homomorphism is reduction modulo p. These are just the elements
represented by integers with a p-adic expansion (13.8) where a0 = 1. Thus
|Upk| = pk−1 .
In the case p = 2 this group would coincide with (Z/pkZ)× itself. The right
definition in this case is
U2k = ker[(Z/2kZ)× →(Z/4Z)×] .
So these are elements which can be represented by integers with a 2-adic expan-
sion (13.8) where a0 = a1 = 1. Therefore
|U2k| = 2k−2 .
The groups Upk are the key to finding the structure of (Z/pkZ)×:
Theorem 13.16. The group Upk is cyclic. Assume k > 1. Then for p > 2, the element
1 + p is a generator, and for p = 2, the element ¯5.
Proof. Suppose that p > 2. Since |Upk| = pk−1, the order of 1 + p must be a
power of p. But by the binomial formula,
(1 + p)pk−2 ≡1 + pk−1
(mod pk)
̸≡1
(mod pk) .
Therefore
|1 + p| = pk−1 ,
and Upk is cyclic.
If p = 2, we have
(1 + 22)2k−3 ≡1 + 2k−1
(mod 2k)
̸≡1
(mod 2k) .

13.5. THE MULTIPLICATIVE GROUP OF THE INTEGERS MOD N
221
Therefore
|¯5| = 2k−2 ,
and U2k is cyclic too.
Corollary 13.17. For p > 2, (Z/pkZ)× is cyclic, and (Z/2kZ)× ∼=
U2k ×
(Z/4Z)×.
Proof. For p > 2, we have that |(Z/pkZ)×| = (p −1)pk−1. So decomposing
the group into a product of cyclic groups of prime power order, we see that one
factor is Upk, and the product of the remaining factors is isomorphic to (Z/pZ)×.
Thus
(Z/pkZ)× ∼= Upk × (Z/pZ)× .
As we shall see (see theorem 14.7), (Z/pZ)× is cyclic. Therefore since the orders
of these two groups are relatively prime, by example 5.9(ii), their product is cyclic.
If p = 2, then U2k is cyclic of order 2k−2 and (Z/4Z)× is cyclic of order
2. So by theorem 13.11, (Z/2kZ)× is either the product of the two or is cyclic.
Now let
a = 1 + 2 + · · · + 2k−1 = 2k −1 .
Then
a2 = (2k −1)2 ≡1
(mod 2k)
and
a ≡3
(mod 4) .
Therefore ⟨¯a⟩⊂(Z/2kZ)× maps isomorphically onto (Z/4Z)× under re-
duction mod 4, and
(Z/2kZ)× ∼= U2k × ⟨¯a⟩∼= U2k × (Z/4Z)× .

Part II
Solving Equations
225

Introduction
In the coming chapters, we are going to use the group theory discussed so far
to see how to solve polynomial equations. What 'solving' an equation means
is a rather delicate question. People have known how to write solutions for a
quadratic equation in terms of the square root of its discriminant for some 4000
years, and today everyone learns the formula in high school. It is simple and
very useful. In the Renaissance similar formulas were discovered for cubics and
quartics. However, they are much more complicated and much less useful. Early
in the 19th century it was realized that for equations of degree greater than 4,
there do not even exist formulas for solutions in terms of radicals. At the same
time several mathematicians noticed that the symmetries of an equation, as we
discussed them in some examples in chapter 7, tell you many interesting and
profound things about its solutions. This point of view has been developed with
great success in the past two centuries and will be the theme of the remainder of
this book. If you are interested in the history of these ideas, the first part of van
der Waerden's History of  Algebra ([10]) is a good reference.
To begin we set out the basic properties of polynomials in chapter 14. Then
we clarify what we mean by 'algebraic relations' among the roots of a polynomial.
To do this we introduce field extensions, in particular the splitting field of a poly-
nomial in chapter 16. With this apparatus in place we can explain in chapter 17
exactly what the symmetry group or Galois group of an equation is, and what
its properties are. We shall give two classical applications of this theory: first, to
prove in chpater 20 that an equation of degree greater than 4 cannot in general
be solved by taking roots, and secondly to discuss geometric constructions with
straight edge and compass in chpater 21.

14
Polynomial Rings
In this chapter we will look at polynomials with coefficients in an arbitrary field.
These behave in many ways like the integers. There is a Euclidean algorithm for
long division. There are 'prime' polynomials and there is unique factorization
into 'primes'. And the set of all polynomials with coefficients in a given field has
formal properties like those of Z.
14.1
Basic Properties of  Polynomials
To begin with, let F be a field. A polynomial with coefficients in F is an expres-
sion of the form
f(x) = amxm + . . . + a1x + a0 ,
where a0, . . . , am ∈F. We define the degree of the polynomial f, written deg f,
to be the degree of the highest monomial with a non-zero coefficient:
deg f = max{n | an ̸= 0} .
If f(x) = anxn + . . . + a1x + a0 with an ̸= 0, then an is called the leading
coefficient of f. We can add polynomials in the obvious way:
(amxm + . . . + a1x + a0) + (bmxm + . . . + b1x + b0)
= (am + bm)xm + . . . + (a1 + b1)x + (a0 + b0)
227

228
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
and multiply them:
(amxm + . . . + a1x + a0)(bmxm + . . . + b1x + b0) = c2mx2m + . . . + c1x + c0
where
cn =
n
∑
i=0
aibn−i .
(The two polynomials can have any degree ≤m. It makes it easier to write the
formulas if you allow terms with zero coefficients.) Clearly, for any f, g,
deg(fg) = deg f + deg g .
The set of all polynomials with coefficients in F, we will denote by F[x]:
F[x] = {amxm + am−1xm−1 + . . . + a1x + a0 | m ≥0, a0, . . . , am ∈F}
We can regard F as the set of constant polynomials in F[x].
Next we show that we can do long division with polynomials. Remember
that for a, b ∈Z, a, b ̸= 0,
b = qa + r ,
where q, r ∈Z, and 0 ≤r < |a|. Here is the analogous statement for polyno-
mials.
Theorem 14.1. Suppose f, g ∈F[x], f, g ̸= 0. Then there exist unique q, r ∈F[x],
with deg r < deg f, such that
g = qf + r .
Proof. Let m = deg f and n = deg g. We will argue by induction on n −m.
If n −m < 0, in other words deg g < deg f, then we take q = 0 and r = g.
Now let n −m = l ≥0 and assume that the statement of the theorem holds for
n −m < l. Suppose that am is the leading coefficient of f, and bn the leading
coefficient of g. Then we can write
g(x) = (bn/am)xn−mf(x) + h(x)

14.1. BASIC PROPERTIES OF POLYNOMIALS
229
where deg h < deg g. Therefore deg h−deg f < l. So by the induction assump-
tion there exist q1, r ∈F[x], with deg r < deg f such that
h(x) = q1(x)f(x) + r(x) .
But then
g(x) =
(
(bn/am)xn−m + q1(x)
)
f(x) + r(x) .
Thus the statement holds for n −m = l and by the principle of induction, for
all values of n −m.
To see that q and r are unique, suppose that there exist q′ and r′ as well, such
that
g = q′f + r′ ,
with deg r′ < deg f. Then
(q −q′)f = r′ −r .
But deg(r′ −r) < deg(q −q′)f unless q −q′ = 0. But then r′ = r too. So q
and r are uniquely determined.
Now we can define common divisors just as we did for the integers in chapter
1. If f, g ∈F[x], then one says that f  divides g , and writes
f | g ,
if g = qf for some q ∈F[x]. Notice that a non-zero scalar a ∈F × divides any
polynomial g ∈F[x]. A polynomial d is a common divisor of f and g if d | f and
d | g. In order to have a unique greatest common divisor we make the following
definition: a polynomial d ∈F[x] is monic if its leading coefficient is 1.
Definition 14.2. The greatest common divisor of f, g ∈F[x] is the common
divisor of f and g which is monic and of greatest degree.
As for integers, the greatest common divisor is denoted by (f, g) . And just
as for integers the greatest common divisor can be computed using the Euclidean
algorithm . We write

for some n. To see that this algorithm computes (f, g) we argue just as in chapter
1. First we prove:
Lemma 14.3. Let u and v be polynomials in F[x], not both 0. Write
u = qv + r ,
for some q and r with deg r < deg v. Then
(u, v) = (v, r) .
The proof is the same as the proof of lemma 1.7. Applying this to the list of
divisions above we obtain
(ri−1, ri) = (ri, ri+1)
for each i < n. Now the last equation says that rn | rn−1. This means that
rn = a(rn−1, rn) ,
for some a ∈F ×. Therefore arguing by induction,
rn = a(ri−1, ri)
for all i, in particular
rn = a(f, g) .
So up to a scalar factor, rn is the greatest common divisor of f and g. It is easy
to see that any common divisor of f and g divides (f, g).

14.1. BASIC PROPERTIES OF POLYNOMIALS
231
As in chapter 1, we can read more out of this list of equations. The first
equation can be rewritten
r = g −qf .
Using this, we can rewrite the second one:
r1 = f −q1r = f −q1(g −qf) = (1 + q1q)f −q1g .
In other words, r and then r1 are linear combinations of f and g, with coeffi-
cients from F[x]. The third equation shows that r2 is a linear combination of r1
and r, and therefore of f and g. Continuing like this, we get that rn is a linear
combination of f and g. Thus there exist s, t ∈F[x] such that
(f, g) = sf + tg .
Example 14.4. In F11[x], let
f(x) = x4 + x3 + x2 + 3x + 2
and
g(x) = x5 −x4 −x3 + 2x2 −x −2 .
Then
x5 −x4 −x3 + 2x2 −x −2 = (x −2)(x4 + x3 + x2 + 3x + 2) + (x2 + 3x + 2)
x4 + x3 + x2 + 3x + 2 = (x2 −2x + 5)(x2 + 3x + 2) + 3(x + 1)
x2 + 3x + 2 = (4x + 8)(3x + 3) .
Therefore
x + 1 = (x4 + x3 + x2 + 3x + 2, x5 −x4 −x3 + 2x2 −x −2) .

232
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
Furthermore
x2 + 3x + 2 = (x5 −x4 −x3 + 2x2 −x −2) −(x −2)(x4 + x3 + x2 + 3x + 2)
x + 1 = 4(x4 + x3 + x2 + 3x + 2) −4(x2 −2x + 5)(x2 + 3x + 2)
= 4(x4 + x3 + x2 + 3x + 2) −(4x2 + 3x + 9)
[
(x5 −x4 −x3 + 2x2 −x −2) −(x −2)(x4 + x3 + x2 + 3x + 2)
]
= (4x3 + 6x2 + 3x + 8)(x4 + x3 + x2 + 3x + 2)
+ (7x2 + 8x + 2)(x5 −x4 −x3 + 2x2 −x −2) .
So we can take
s = 4x3 + 6x2 + 3x + 8
and
t = 7x2 + 8x + 2 .
△
We say that f and g are relatively prime if (f, g) = 1, that is, if they have no
common divisors except the non-zero scalars. Thus, if f and g are relatively
prime, there exist polynomials s and t such that
1 = sf + tg .
For example, x2 + 1 and x + 1 in Q[x] are relatively prime and
1 = 1
2(x2 + 1) −1
2(x −1)(x + 1) .
We also want to discuss roots of polynomials and their relation to divisors.
Definition 14.5. A root of a polynomial f ∈F[x] is an element a ∈F such
that f(a) = 0.
Theorem 14.6. a ∈F is a root of f ∈F[x] if  and only if x −a divides f. If
deg f = n, then f has at most n roots in F.

14.1. BASIC PROPERTIES OF POLYNOMIALS
233
Proof. Given a ∈F, divide f by x −a:
f = q(x −a) + r ,
where deg r < deg(x −a), in other words r ∈F. It follows that
f(a) = q(a −a) + r = r .
So a is a root of f if and only if r = 0, which is the case if and only if (x−a) | f.
We can now argue by induction that if deg f = n, then f has at most n roots.
Start with n = 1. A linear polynomial ax + b has one root: −b/a. Suppose we
know that a polynomial of degree n −1 has at most n −1 roots. Let a be a root
of f. Then
f = q(x −a) ,
where deg q = n −1. If b is any root of f, then
0 = f(b) = q(b)(b −a) .
So either b is a root of q, or b = a. By assumption, q has at most n −1 roots.
Therefore f has at most n roots. Applying the principle of induction, the result
holds then for all n.
This result has a surprising application.
Application 14.7. The multiplicative group F × of a finite field F is cyclic.
Proof. Set n = |F|. So F × is an abelian group of order n −1. By theorem 13.9
F × ∼= Z/d1Z × · · · × Z/dmZ ,
where d1, . . . , dm ∈N, and d1 | d2 | · · · | dm. As pointed out in exercise 13.8,
adm = 1
for all a ∈F ×. Thus all n −1 elements of F × are roots of the polynomial
xdm −1 ∈F[x]. It follows from the theorem above that
n −1 ≤dm .

234
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
On the other hand, since there is an element of order dm in F ×
dm ≤n −1 ,
by corollary 10.4. Therefore dm = n −1 and F × is cyclic.
Remark 14.8. The proof does not need the full power of the classification theorem
for finite abelian groups. An argument using exercise 5.8 is given in exercise
13.16.
14.2
Unique Factorization into Irreducibles
Continuing the analogy between Z and F[x] we now explain what 'primes' are in
F[x] and show that every polynomial can be factored uniquely into a product of
'primes'.
Definition 14.9. A polynomial f ∈F[x] is reducible if it can be factored f = gh,
where g, h ∈F[x], and deg g, deg h > 0. A polynomial f ∈F[x] is irreducible if
it is not reducible.
In other words, a polynomial is irreducible if its only divisors are itself and
the non-zero scalars. For example, x2 + 1 ∈Q[x] is irreducible. Regarded as a
polynomial in F5[x], it is reducible because x2 + 1 = (x + 2)(x + 3) ∈F5[x]. A
polynomial with a root is reducible. But a polynomial may be reducible without
having a root. For example, in Q[x],
x4 −4 = (x2 −2)(x2 + 2) ,
is reducible. But it has no roots in Q because neither x2 + 2 nor x2 −2 have any
roots in Q.
Irreducible polynomials are analogous to prime numbers, and reducible poly-
nomials to composite numbers. And every polynomial can be written in a unique
way as a product of irreducibles. The key to proving this is the following lemma.

14.2. UNIQUE FACTORIZATION INTO IRREDUCIBLES
235
Lemma 14.10. Let p ∈F[x] be irreducible. Suppose p | fg, where f, g ∈F[x]. Then
p | f or p | g.
Proof. Suppose that p does not divide f. Then (p, f) = 1 since the only monic
divisor of p of degree greater than 0 is p itself. Therefore
1 = sp + tf ,
for some s, t ∈F[x]. Multiply by g:
g = spg + tfg .
Now p | spg and p | tfg. So p | g.
It is not hard to extend this result to a product of more than two polynomials:
if p is irreducible, and p | f1 · · · fr , then p | fi for some i, 1 ≤i ≤r. The
following theorem is the analogue of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (see
[1], §2.2), and is proved in the same way.
Theorem 14.11. Let f ∈F[x], where F is a field. Then
f = ap1 · · · pr ,
where a ∈F × and p1, . . . , pr ∈F[x] are irreducible monic polynomials. This decompo-
sition is unique up to the order of p1, . . . , pr.
Proof. First we prove the existence of such a decomposition into irreducibles. We
proceed by induction on n := deg f. Linear polynomials are irreducible. So the
result holds for them. Assume that it holds for all polynomials of degree less
than n. If f is irreducible, then f = ap, where a ∈F × and p is irreducible and
monic. If f is reducible, then
f = gh ,
where deg g, deg h < n. By assumption then
g = bp1 · · · pj
,
h = cpj+1 · · · pr ,

236
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
where b, c ∈F × and p1, . . . , pr are irreducible monic polynomials. It follows
that
f = (bc)p1 · · · pr ,
as desired. So by the principle of induction, any f ∈F[x] can be decomposed
into a product of irreducibles.
Next we demonstrate that such a decomposition is unique up to the order of
the factors. Suppose that
f = ap1 · · · pr ,
and
f = bq1 · · · qs ,
where a, b ∈F × and p1, . . . , pr, q1, . . . , qs ∈F[x] are irreducible monic poly-
nomials. For any i, 1 ≤i ≤r, we have that
pi | q1 · · · qs .
Therefore by the lemma, there exists a j(i), 1 ≤j(i) ≤s, such that pi | qj(i).
But qj(i) is irreducible and monic. Therefore pi = qj(i). Similarly, for any j,
1 ≤j ≤s, there exists an i(j), 1 ≤i(j) ≤r, with qj = pi(j). Thus r = s and
the factors q1, . . . , qr are just p1, . . . , pr re-ordered by the permutation i 7→j(i).
It follows that a = b as well. This completes the proof of the theorem.
14.3
Finding Irreducible Polynomials
Suppose you want to factor a polynomial in F[x]. You have to know which
polynomials are irreducible. Deciding whether one is irreducible or not is usually
not easy. In this section we will look at two simple criteria for irreducibility of
polynomials in Q[x], and how to list irreducible polynomials in Fp[x]. In the last
section of the chapter we will discuss an algorithm for factoring polynomials in
Fp[x]. It will also give us a test for irreducibility.

14.3. FINDING IRREDUCIBLE POLYNOMIALS
237
Let's begin with
f(x) = anxn + · · · + a1x + a0 ∈Q[x] .
If we multiply f by a common multiple a of the denominators of a0, . . . , an, then
af has integer coefficients. One can show that af can be written as a product
of integer polynomials of positive degree, if and only if f is reducible in Q[x].
Lemma 14.12. Suppose f(x) = anxn+· · ·+a1x+a0 ∈Q[x] with a0, . . . , an ∈
Z. If f is reducible, then f = gh where g and h have integer coefficients; g and h can be
taken to be monic if f is monic.
Proof. Suppose that
f = gh ,
g, h ∈Q[x]. Let b (respectively c) be a common multiple of the denominators
of the coefficients of g (respectively h). Set d = bc. Then
df = g1h1 ,
where g1 and h1 have integer coefficients. Now let p be a prime factor of d, and
reduce this equation modulo p. We obtain
0 = ¯g1¯h1 ∈Fp[x] .
Therefore
¯g1 = 0
or
¯h1 = 0 .
Suppose that ¯g1 = 0. This means that all the coefficients of g1 are divisible by p.
So we can divide d and g1 by p:
(d/p)f = g2h2 ,
where g2 and h2 have integer coefficients. We can continue in this way with each
prime factor of d until we end up with a factorization of f into a product of poly-
nomials with integer coefficients. The leading coefficient of f is the product of
the leading coefficients of g and h. So if f is monic, then the leading coefficients
of g and h are both 1 or both −1.

238
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
The Eisenstein criterion then gives a condition for a polynomial with integer
coefficients to be irreducible.
Theorem 14.13. Let
f(x) = xn + · · · + a1x + a0 ∈Q[x] ,
with a0, . . . , an−1 ∈Z. Suppose that for some prime p ∈Z,
p | a0, . . . , p | an−1
;
p2 ∤a0 .
Then f is irreducible.
Proof. Suppose that f is reducible. By the lemma we can assume that f = gh,
where
g = xr + · · · b1x + b0 ,
h = xs + · · · + c1x + c0 ,
with r + s = n, r, s < n and bi, cj ∈Z for 0 ≤i ≤r −1, 0 ≤j ≤s −1.
Then we have that
p | a0 = b0c0 ,
which implies that p | b0 or p | c0. It cannot divide both since by assumption
p2 ∤a0. Suppose that p ∤b0. Now reduce these polynomials modulo p: in Fp[x]
we have
xn = ¯f(x) = ¯g(x)¯h(x) .
We have just said that ¯b0 ̸= 0 and ¯c0 = 0. We want to show that ¯ck = 0 for all
k. Suppose we know that ¯c0 = · · · = ¯ck−1 = 0. Since
0 = ¯ak = ¯bk¯c0 + · · · + ¯b1¯ck−1 + ¯b0¯ck ,
it follows that
0 = ¯ak = ¯b0¯ck ,
which implies that ¯ck = 0. So by the principle of induction, ¯ck = 0 for all k, and
¯h(x) = xs. But then calculating the coefficient of xs in ¯f, we see that
0 = ¯as = ¯b0 ̸= 0 ,
which is impossible. So f is irreducible.

14.3. FINDING IRREDUCIBLE POLYNOMIALS
239
This criterion shows for example that x2+2x+2 is irreducible in Q[x]. Here
is a less obvious example.
Example 14.14. Let f(x) = xp−1 + · · · + x + 1 ∈Q[x] , where p is a prime
number. Since
f(x) = xp −1
x −1 ,
its roots in C are just the roots of unity other than 1 (see example 6.8(iii)). The
Eisenstein criterion does not apply directly to f. But if we make the substitution
x = y + 1 ,
then
g(y) := f(y+1) = (y + 1)p −1
y
= yp−1 +pyp−2 +· · ·+
(p
k
)
yk−1 +· · ·+p .
Since
(p
k
)
≡0 (mod p) , for 1 ≤k ≤p −1, (see exercise 1.4), the criterion
does apply to g. And if g is irreducible then so is f.
△
A second test is based on the following observation. Let f(x) = anxn +
· · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coefficients. Suppose that
f = gh ,
where g and h also have integer coefficients, and deg g, deg h > 0. If we pick a
prime p which does not divide the leading coefficient an and reduce this equation
modulo p, then we obtain
¯f = ¯g¯h ∈Fp[x] .
Since p ∤an , p does not divide the leading coefficients of g and h. Therefore
deg ¯g = deg g > 0 ,
deg ¯h = deg h > 0 .
So ¯f is reducible in Fp[x]. Taking the converse of this gives us a test for irre-
ducibility:

240
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
Test 14.15. Let
f(x) = anxn + · · · + a1x + a0 ∈Q[x] ,
where a0, . . . , an ∈Z. If  there exists a prime p ∤an , such that ¯f, the reduction of f mod
p, is irreducible, then f is irreducible in Q[x].
This is a very practical test because it is easy to check whether polynomials in
Fp[x] are irreducible, as we shall see in the final section of the chapter.
Example 14.16. Take f(x) = x5 −5x + 12 ∈Q[x]. If we reduce f modulo 7,
it is not hard to check that ¯f ∈F7[x] is irreducible. Therefore f is irreducible.△
You can build a list of irreducible polynomials in Fp[x] by using a sieve, like
Eratosthene's sieve for finding prime numbers (see [1], p.14). First write down all
the linear polynomials, then the quadratic ones, and so on. Cross out the multiples
of x, of x + 1, ..., then of the remaining quadratics, .... The polynomials which
are left are irreducible. It is enough to find the monic irreducibles since the others
will be scalar multiples of them. For example, take p = 2. First list the monic
polynomials over F2:
x, x + 1
x2, x2 + 1, x2 + x, x2 + x + 1
x3, x3 + 1, x3 + x, x3 + x2, x3 + x + 1, x3 + x2 + 1, x3 + x2 + x,
x3 + x2 + x + 1
x4, x4 + 1, x4 + x, x4 + x2, x4 + x3, x4 + x + 1, . . .
...
Cross out multiples of the linear polynomials:
x, x + 1
x2 + x + 1
x3 + x2 + 1, x3 + x + 1
x4 + x + 1, x4 + x2 + 1, x4 + x3 + 1, x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1
...

14.4. COMMUTATIVE RINGS
241
Cross out the multiples of the remaining quadratics:
x, x + 1
x2 + x + 1
x3 + x2 + 1, x3 + x + 1
x4 + x + 1, x4 + x3 + 1, x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1
...
Cross out the multiples of the remaining cubics ..., and so on. The list above
already gives us the monic irreducible polynomials of degree less than 5.
You can also prove that there are infinitely many irreducible monic polyno-
mials in Fp[x] by imitating the classical proof that there are infinitely many prime
numbers (see [1], theorem 1.6). Suppose that there were only finitely many irre-
ducible monic polynomials. Make a list of them: f1, f2, . . . , fm. Let
f = f1f2 · · · fm + 1 .
If f were reducible, then one of the list of irreducible polynomials would divide
it, say fj | f for some j, 1 ≤j ≤m. Then
fj | (f −f1f2 · · · fm) = 1 .
This is impossible. So f must be irreducible. It is monic since f1, f2, . . . , fm are.
But it does not occur in the list because
deg f > deg fj
for all j, 1 ≤j ≤m. So there cannot be only finitely many monic irreducible
polynomials in Fp[x].
14.4
Commutative Rings
We have been emphasizing similarities between F[x] and Z. The most basic
similarity is that addition and multiplication look the same in both. This suggests
that it is useful to make a definition which sets out these common properties.

242
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
Definition 14.17. A ring R is a set with two binary operations, 'addition' and
'multiplication' satisfying:
(i) R is an abelian group under addition;
(ii) multiplication is associative;
(iii) there is an identity element for multiplication, written 1, which is not 0;
(iv) multiplication is distributive over addition.
A ring is called commutative if its multiplication is commutative. Thus F[x]
and Z are commutative rings. The set M(n, F) of all n × n matrices with co-
efficients in a field F is a ring under matrix addition and multiplication which is
not commutative. Any field is a commutative ring. In fact a field is just a com-
mutative ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. In
general, the group of  units of a ring R is the set
R× = {a ∈R | a has a multiplicative inverse}
with the operation of ring multiplication. Thus
Z× = {±1}
and
F[x]× = F × .
As we saw in chapter 1, the integers mod n, Z/nZ, have a well-defined mul-
tiplication which satisfies the properties above. So Z/nZ is also a commutative
ring. Its group of units, (Z/nZ)×, was introduced in example 5(v) and studied
in detail in chapter 13, page 218ff.
Remark 14.18. Most commutative rings do not have unique factorization into
primes, like Z and F[x].
If R and S are rings, then a mapping ψ : R →S is a ring homomorphism if it
is a group homomorphism which respects multiplication:

14.4. COMMUTATIVE RINGS
243
(i) ψ(a + b) = ψ(a) + ψ(b),
(ii) ψ(ab) = ψ(a)ψ(b),
(iii) ψ(1) = 1,
for any a, b ∈R. For example, the canonical map Z →Z/nZ is a ring ho-
momorphism. A homomorphism which is bijective is called an isomorphism.
Remark 14.19.
(i) Suppose that ψ : R →S is a ring homomorphism, and let
a ∈R be a unit. Then ψ(a) is a unit in S:
1 = ψ(1) = ψ(aa−1) = ψ(a)ψ(a−1) .
In particular, ψ(a) ̸= 0. Now if R is a field, then every non-zero element
is a unit. So in this case ker ψ = 0 and ψ is injective.
(ii) Let F be a field. Define ψ : Z →F by
ψ(n) := 1 + · · · + 1
|
{z
}
n
,
ψ(−n) := −ψ(n)
,
ψ(0) := 0 ,
for n ∈N. Then ψ is a ring homomorphism, and
ker ψ = pZ ,
where p is either 0 or the least positive integer in ker ψ (see exercise 6.11).
In the first case ψ is injective, and ψ(n) has a multiplicative inverse if
n ̸= 0. Therefore we can extend ψ to all of Q by setting
ψ(m/n) = ψ(m)ψ(n)−1 ,
for any m, n ∈Z, n ̸= 0. It is easy to see that this is a homomorphism,
and by the previous remark, it must be injective. So there is a copy of Q
inside F. Examples of such fields are R and C.

244
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
The other possibility is that p > 0. Suppose that p is a composite number,
say
p = qr ,
where q, r > 0. Then in F,
0 = p · 1 = qr · 1 = (q · 1)(r · 1).
Since F is a field, we must have that either q · 1 = 0 or r · 1 = 0. But
we chose p to be the least positive integer in ker ψ. So this cannot happen,
and p must be prime. Now from theorem 10.12, we know that ψ induces
a group homomorphism
Fp = Z/pZ
¯ψ
−−−→F .
It is easy to see that ¯ψ is a ring homomorphism, and therefore by the
previous remark, must be injective. So in this case, F contains a copy of
Fp. An example is the field Fp2 (see exercise 1.21) which contains Fp as
the set of diagonal matrices.
Definition 14.20. Let F be a field. If there exists a prime p such that p · 1 = 0
in F, then p is called the characteristic of F, written
chr F = p .
If no such p exists, then
chr F := 0 .
The copy of Q in F, if chr F = 0, or of Fp, if chr F = p, is called the prime field
of F.
Later on we shall be very interested in automorphisms of a field. An
automorphism of a field F is an isomorphism of F to itself. The set of all auto-
morphisms forms a group under composition (see exercise 11).
Just as you can construct the field of rational numbers from the integers,
so you can construct the field of rational functions F(x) from F[x] A rational

14.5. CONGRUENCES
245
function over F is a quotient f/g where f, g ∈F[x] and g ̸= 0. We identify
f/g with kf/kg for any k ∈F[x]. You can define addition and multiplication
just as for rational numbers:
f1
g1
+ f2
g2
:= f1g2 + f2g1
g1g2
,
f1
g1
· f2
g2
:= f1f2
g1g2
,
where f1, f2, g1, g2 ∈F[x] , g1, g2 ̸= 0. With these two operations, F(x) is a
commutative ring. The ring of polynomials F[x] can be regarded as a subring
by identifying f ∈F[x] with the quotient f/1 ∈F(x). Any rational function
f/g ̸= 0 has a multiplicative inverse, g/f. So just like Q , F(x) is a field.
14.5
Congruences
We can also look at 'congruences' modulo a polynomial and 'quotient rings' anal-
ogous to Z/nZ. Suppose f ∈F[x] and define the subgroup (f) by
(f) := fF[x] = {fg | g ∈F[x]}
The quotient group F[x]/(f) has a well-defined multiplication induced by the
multiplication on F[x]: given f1, f2 ∈F[x]
(f1 + fg1)(f2 + fg2) = f1f2 + f(f1g2 + g1f2 + fg1g2) ,
where g1, g2 ∈F[x], so that in F[x]/(f)
(f1 + fg1)(f2 + fg2) = f1f2 .
This multiplication satisfies properties (ii), (iii), and (iv) in 14.17. So F[x]/(f)
is also a commutative ring, and is called a quotient ring of F[x]. It is sometimes
convenient to describe calculations in F[x]/(f) via congruences mod f:
f1 ≡f2
(mod f)
means that f1 = f2 + fg for some g ∈F[x], in other words, ¯f1 = ¯f2 in
F[x]/(f).

246
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
Notice that F[x]/(f) is an F-vector space. In fact if deg f = n, then
dimF F[x]/(f) = n .
Why is this so? Well any g ∈F[x] can be written
g = qf + r ,
where deg r < n. In other words, ¯g = ¯r is a linear combination of 1, ¯x, . . . , ¯xn−1.
Thus {1, ¯x, . . . , ¯xn−1} spans F[x]/(f). On the other hand, if for some
a0, . . . , an−1 ∈F,
a0 + a1¯x + · · · + an−1¯xn−1 = 0
in F[x]/(f), then f | (a0 + a1x + · · · + an−1xn−1), which is not possible. So
{1, ¯x, . . . , ¯xn−1} is linearly independent.
This construction is particularly interesting when f is irreducible. Remember
that for p a prime number, Z/pZ is a field. The same is true for F[x]/(f) if f is
irreducible.
Theorem 14.21. Let f ∈F[x]. If f is irreducible, then F[x]/(f) is a field.
Proof. We must show that every non-zero element in F[x]/(f) has a multiplica-
tive inverse. So suppose g ∈F[x] and f ∤g. Then f and g are relatively prime
because f is irreducible. So there exist s, t ∈F[x] such that
1 = sf + tg .
Therefore
tg ≡1
(mod f) ,
or equivalently, ¯t¯g = 1 ∈F[x]/(f). Thus F[x]/(f) is a field.
Examples 14.22.
(i) Let f = x2 + 1 ∈R[x]. Since deg(x2 + 1) = 2,
dimR R[x]/(x2 + 1) = 2 ,

14.5. CONGRUENCES
247
In fact we know that
{1, ¯x}
is a basis. Since x2 + 1 is irreducible, R[x]/(x2 + 1) is a field. Now let
i := ¯x. Then every element can be written in the form a + bi, a, b ∈R,
and
i2 + 1 = ¯x2 + 1 = x2 + 1 = 0.
So
R[x]/(x2 + 1) ∼= C ,
the field of complex numbers.
(ii) Let f(x) = x2 −2 ∈Q[x]. By the Eisenstein criterion, x2 −2 is irre-
ducible. So Q[x]/(x2 −2) is a field. Since deg(x2 −2) = 2,
dimQ Q[x]/(x2 −2) = 2 .
Define a homomorphism ϵ√
2 : Q[x] →R by
ϵ√
2 (g) = g(
√
2) .
Given a polynomial g ∈Q[x], we can divide it by x2 −2:
g(x) = q(x)(x2 −2) + (ax + b) ,
for some a, b ∈Q. Then
ϵ√
2 (g) = g(
√
2) = a
√
2 + b .
So the image of ϵ√
2 is
Q(
√
2) = {a
√
2 + b | a, b ∈Q}
(see exercise 1.19). Now for any g ∈Q[x],
ϵ√
2
(
g(x)(x2 −2)
)
= 0 .

248
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
Therefore ϵ√
2 induces a homomorphism
¯ϵ√
2 : Q[x]/(x2 −2) →Q(
√
2) ⊂R .
This is injective because Q[x]/(x2 −2) is a field. Since it is also surjective,
it is in fact an isomorphism.
(iii) Suppose r ∈Fp is not a square. Let f = x2 −r ∈Fp[x]. Then f is
irreducible. Therefore Fp[x]/(f) is a field. Again, since deg(x2 −r) = 2,
dimFp Fp[x]/(f) = 2 ,
It is not hard to see that the mapping
a + b¯x 7→
( a
b
br
a
)
is an isomorphism from Fp[x]/(f) to the field Fp2 defined in exercise 1.21.
(iv) Take f(x) = xp−1 + · · · + x + 1 ∈Q[x], where p is a prime number. In
example 14.14 we saw that f is irreducible, so that Q[x]/(f) is a field. If
we set ω = e2πi/p, then its roots are
{ω, . . . , ωp−1} .
Let
Q(ω) = {a0 + a1ω + · · · + ap−2ωp−2 | a0, . . . , ap−2 ∈Q} .
Define a homomorphism ϵω : Q[x] →C by
ϵω(g) = g(ω) .
The image is just Q(ω), and the induced map
¯ϵω : Q[x]/(f) →C ,
is injective. So Q(ω) is a field and
Q[x]/(f) ∼= Q(ω) .

14.5. CONGRUENCES
249
Remark 14.23. We can generalize the constructions in (ii) and (iv) which use eval-
uation maps. Suppose that E and F are fields, with F ⊂E. So any polynomial
in F[x] can be regarded as being a polynomial in E[x] too. Pick an element
ζ ∈E. Define a map (evaluation at ζ)
ϵζ : F[x] →E
by
ϵζ(f) = f(ζ) .
for f ∈F[x]. Then ϵζ is a ring homomorphism: for any f, g ∈F[x],
ϵζ(f + g) = (f + g)(ζ) = f(ζ) + g(ζ) = ϵζ(f) + ϵζ(g)
ϵζ(fg) = (fg)(ζ) = f(ζ)g(ζ) = ϵζ(f)ϵζ(g)
ϵζ(1) = 1(ζ) = 1 .
Now suppose that f ∈F[x] is irreducible of degree n, and that ζ ∈E is a root
of f. Any g ∈F[x] can be written
g = qf + r ,
where deg r < n. Therefore
ϵζ(g) = g(ζ) = q(ζ)g(ζ) + r(ζ) = r(ζ) .
So the image of ϵζ is
F(ζ) := {a0 + a1ζ + · · · + an−1ζn−1 | a0, . . . , an−1 ∈F} ⊂E .
The homomorphism ϵζ induces a homomorphism
¯ϵζ : F[x]/(f) →E ,
since (gf)(ζ) = g(ζ)f(ζ) = 0 , for any g ∈F[x]. As F[x]/(f) is a field, ¯ϵζ
must be injective. So F(ζ) ∼= F[x]/(f) is a field, with F ⊂F(ζ) ⊂E. We
shall make heavy use of such fields in coming chapters.

250
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
Just as in the integers, we have the Chinese remainder theorem (see theorem
1.12).
Theorem 14.24 (Chinese Remainder Theorem). If p1, . . . , pm ∈F[x] are pairwise
relatively prime, then the m congruences
f ≡gi
(mod pi) , 1 ≤i ≤m ,
have a unique solution modulo p1 · · · pm for any gi ∈F[x].
Proof. We prove the theorem by induction on m. If m = 1, we are looking at a
single congruence
f ≡g1
(mod p1)
with the solution f = g1, which is unique modulo p1. So suppose that the result
holds for m −1 congruences, m > 1. We want to show that m congruences
f ≡gi
(mod pi) , 1 ≤i ≤m ,
have a solution. By the induction assumption, the first m −1 of these have a
solution fm−1 ∈F[x] and all other solutions are of the form
fm−1 + up1 · · · pm−1 ,
for u ∈F[x]. The mth congruence then becomes
up1 · · · pm−1 ≡gm −fm−1
(mod pm) ,
which we want to solve for u. Now given that p1, . . . , pm are pairwise relatively
prime, it is easy to check that (p1 · · · pm−1, pm) = 1. Therefore there exist
s, t ∈F[x] such that
1 = sp1 · · · pm−1 + tpm .
Multiplying this equation by gm −fm−1 gives
gm −fm−1 = (gm −fm−1)sp1 · · · pm−1 + (gm −fm−1)tpm .

14.5. CONGRUENCES
251
Thus
(gm −fm−1)sp1 · · · pm−1 ≡gm −fm−1
(mod pm) .
So take u = (gm −fm−1)s and let
f = fm−1 + (gm −fm−1)sp1 · · · pm−1 .
Then
f ≡fm−1 ≡gi
(mod pi) , 1 ≤i ≤m −1 ,
and
f ≡fm−1 + (gm −fm−1) ≡gm
(mod pm) ,
which are the m congruences we want to solve. Therefore by the principle of
induction, there exists a solution for all m.
If f and g are two solutions then
f −g ≡0
(mod pi) , 1 ≤i ≤m .
Since p1, . . . , pm are relatively prime, it follows that p1 · · · pm | (f −g), in other
words
f ≡g
(mod p1 · · · pm) .
Remark 14.25. The theorem can also be interpreted the following way (cf. exam-
ple 5.10(ii) and exercise 5.24). For any f ∈F[x], let ¯f denote its residue class in
F[x]/(p1 · · · pm), and ¯fj its residue class in F[x]/(pj), for 1 ≤j ≤m. Then
the map
ψ : F[x]/(p1 · · · pm) →F[x]/(p1) × · · · × F[x]/(pm)
given by
ψ : ¯f 7→( ¯f1, . . . , ¯fm) .
is well-defined and is a ring homomorphism (see exercise 19 for direct products of
rings). The Chinese remainder theorem says precisely that ψ is an isomorphism.

252
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
14.6
Factoring Polynomials over a Finite Field
Earlier we saw how to build up a list of irreducible polynomials in Fp[x]. This
is clearly not a good way to find out whether a given polynomial is irreducible.
There is a very effective algorithm, discovered by Berlekamp, which will test for
irreducibility. In fact it is actually an algorithm for factoring polynomials over Fp.
To explain it we need to make some preparations.
First consider the polynomial xp −x ∈Fp[x] . According to theorem 10.6,
every a ∈Fp is a root. Since xp −x has exactly p roots, these are all. So xp −x
factors
xp −x = x(x −1) · · · (x −p + 1) .
If g is any polynomial in Fp[x] then we can substitute g for x in the previous
equation and obtain
g(x)p −g(x) = g(x)
(
g(x) −1
)
· · ·
(
g(x) −p + 1
)
.
(14.1)
Now suppose we have a monic polynomial f ∈Fp[x]. We can factor it into
irreducibles as in theorem 14.11:
f = q1 · · · qr
where each qi = pmi
i
for some monic irreducible polynomial pi, and some
mi ∈N, and where q1, . . . , qr are pairwise relatively prime. Our algorithm will
determine q1, . . . , qr. How can one determine p1, . . . , pr from them? Suppose
that q = sm, where s is irreducible. There are two cases to consider: (i) p ∤m;
(ii) p | m.
Lemma 14.26.
(i) If p ∤m, then (q, q′) ̸= 1 and s = q/(q, q′).
(ii) If m = pn, then q(x) = q1(xp) for some q1 ∈Fp[x].
Proof. In the first case,
q′ = msm−1s′

14.6. FACTORING POLYNOMIALS OVER A FINITE FIELD
253
Since s is irreducible, (s, s′) = 1 and therefore
(q, q′) = sm−1 .
It follows that
s = q/(q, q′) .
Now for any polynomial s ∈Fp[x], putting together exercise 1.4 and theorem
10.6, we see that
s(x)p = s(xp) .
So if q = spm, then
q(x) = (s(x)p)m = sm(xp) ,
and we can take q1 = sm to get the second statement.
To determine s in the second case, we have to apply the lemma again to q1.
Suppose then that
f = q1 · · · qr ∈Fp[x] ,
where q1, . . . , qr are pairwise relatively prime. How can we find the factors qi?
Berlekamp's idea is to consider the congruences
g ≡a1
(mod q1)
. . .
g ≡ar
(mod qr)
(14.2)
where a1, . . . , ar ∈Fp. According to the Chinese remainder theorem, there is
a unique solution g modulo q1 · · · qr = f. From solutions to such congruences
you can find the factors q1, . . . , qr. On the other hand, a solution g is a solution
of the congruence
gp −g ≡0
(mod f) .
(14.3)
This congruence is easy to solve. We shall now explain this in detail.
Recall that V := Fp[x]/(f) is a vector space over Fp of dimension n = deg f.
The map
ψ : g 7→gp

254
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
is a linear mapping of V to itself. The set of solutions W ⊂V of the congruence
(14.3) is just the kernel of ψ −I. So if we let A be the matrix of ψ with respect
to the basis {1, x, . . . , xn−1} of V , then W = ker(A −I). This explains how
to solve (14.3).
Now if g is a solution of (14.3), then each qi divides the right hand side of
equation (14.1) since f = q1 · · · qr. As the terms on the right hand side are
relatively prime, this means that for each i, 1 ≤i ≤r, there is an ai ∈Fp
such that qi | g −ai . Therefore g is a solution of the congruences (14.2) with
this choice of a1, . . . , ar. Conversely, suppose g is a solution of (14.2) for some
a1, . . . , ar. Each term g −ai occurs in the right hand side of equation (14.1).
Therefore q1 · · · qr = f divides the right hand side and thus g is a solution of
(14.3). So r-tuples (a1, . . . , ar) correspond to solutions of (14.3). This give us
the connection between (14.2) and (14.3). In fact we have a linear map from
Fp
r →W ,
given by
(a1 . . . ar) 7→g ,
(14.4)
where g is the corresponding solution of (14.2). Since this map is an isomor-
phism, the dimension of W is r.
Finally we must know how to find the factors q1, . . . , qr from solutions g ∈
W. Looking at (14.2) we see that
(g −ai, f) ̸= 1
for 1 ≤i ≤r. It is not hard to see that
f =
∏
a∈Fp
(g −a, f) ,
(14.5)
for any g ∈W (see exercise 23). If a ̸= b are in Fp and (g −a, f) ̸= 1 and
(g −b, f) ̸= 1, then these two factors of f will be relatively prime. So if the
numbers of the r-tuple (a1 . . . ar) corresponding to g are all distinct, then we

14.6. FACTORING POLYNOMIALS OVER A FINITE FIELD
255
have r relatively prime factors of f and are finished. If not, then we must take
each factor ˜f we have found and repeat the procedure with it. Let's summarize
this all in the form of an algorithm:
Algorithm 14.27. Suppose that f is a polynomial in Fp[x]. To factor f into
irreducible polynomials:
(i) Solve the congruence
gp −g ≡0
(mod f) .
Let g1 = 1, g2, . . . , gr be a basis of the solution space, with
deg gk < deg f, 1 ≤k ≤r.
(ii) Find all a ∈Fp such that
(g2 −a, f) ̸= 0 .
If there are r such numbers a, then you have r relatively prime factors of
f and are finished by (14.5).
(iii) Otherwise, take each such factor ˜f and find all a ∈Fp such that
(g3 −a, ˜f) ̸= 0 .
Now
deg(g3 −a, ˜f) < deg f .
This means that as you continue with g4, . . . , gr the process will terminate,
and you will end up with r relatively prime factors of f.
(iv) Each qi = pmi
i
where pi is irreducible. To determine pi take the derivative
of qi. If q′
i ̸= 0, then
pi = qi/(qi, q′
i) .
If q′
i = 0, then qi(x) = ˜qi(xp), for some ˜qi ∈Fp[xp]. The polynomial ˜qi
is in turn a power of an irreducible polynomial in Fp[xp]. So we return to
the beginning of this step and take its derivative.

256
CHAPTER 14. POLYNOMIAL RINGS
Let's calculate an example.
Example 14.28. Set
f = 3 + x + 6x2 + 2x3 + 4x4 + 5x5 + x6 ∈F7[x] .
We want to find solutions of
g7 −g ≡0
(mod f) .
To do this we compute the matrix A of
g 7→g7
in V := F7[x]/(f) with respect to the basis {1, x, . . . , x5}. We have
x0
=
1
x7
=
1 + 2x + x2 + 4x3 + 4x4
x14
=
3 + 4x + 3x2 + 3x3 + 2x4 + 3x5
x21
=
3 + 3x + x2 + x3 + x4 + 4x5
x28
=
3 + 5x2 + 5x3 + 2x4
x35
=
3 + 3x2 + 5x4 + 5x5
Therefore the matrix is
A =


If we row reduce A −I we see that its kernel has the basis {(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
(0, 3, 6, 5, 1, 1)}, or equivalently, the solution space of (14.3) has a basis
{1, 3x + 6x2 + 5x3 + x4 + x5} and r = 2. So taking
g = 3x + 6x2 + 5x3 + x4 + x5

14.7. CALCULATIONS
257
we look for solutions of (14.2). We find that
(g + 4, f)
=
5 + 3x + x2
(g + 5, f)
=
2 + 6x + 2x3 + x4
and
f = (5 + 3x + x2)(2 + 6x + 2x3 + x4) .
The quadratic q1 = 5 + 3x + x2 ∈F7[x] is clearly irreducible. But
q2 = 2 + 6x + 2x3 + x4 is not:
(q2, q′
2) = 3 + x + x2 .
This quadratic too is irreducible, and q2 = (3 + x + x2)2. So we have found the
irreducible factors of f:
f = (5 + 3x + x2)(3 + x + x2)2 .
14.7
Calculations
Mathematica has a function PolynomialExtendedGCD which calculates (f, g)
for two polynomials f and g, as well as polynomials s and t such that
(f, g) = sf + tg .
If we take f = x3 + x2 + x + 1, g = x4 + x3 + x + 1 ∈Q[x] , we obtain

x^4+x^3+x+1 ]

Mathematica is very useful for a calculation like example 14.28. We have

Out[3]= 3 + x + 6x2 + 2x3 + 4x4 + 5x5 + x6
To compute x7, x14, x21, x28, and x35 in term of the basis 1, x, ..., x6 of V ,
we can use the function PolynomialMod which reduces a polynomial modulo a
natural number n and a polynomial f.

Symmetric Polynomials
The coefficients of a polynomial in one variable are symmetric functions of its
roots. So are other quantities, like the discriminant of the polynomial. In this
chapter we will discuss symmetric polynomials and their basic properties. First
we say a little about polynomials in more than one variable.
15.1
Polynomials in Several Variables
Let F be a field. A polynomial f in n variables x1, x2, . . . , xn with coefficients
in F is a finite sum
f(x1, . . . , xn) =
∑
i1,...,in
ai1··· inxi1
1 · · · xin
n ,
where the coefficients ai1··· in lie in F. We denote by F[x1, . . . , xn] the set of
all polynomials in x1, . . . , xn with coefficients in F. The degree of a monomial
xi1
1 · · · xin
n is i1 + · · · + in. The degree of a polynomial f is the largest degree of
a monomial with a non-zero coefficient in f. For example, the degree of
x2
1x3
2x3 + x1x4
3 ∈F[x1, x2, x3] ,
is 6. You can add and multiply two such polynomials in the obvious way. With
these two operations F[x1, . . . , xn] becomes a commutative ring. The zero ele-
ment is the polynomial, all of whose coefficients are 0. The constant polynomials
form a subring isomorphic to the field of coefficients F.
267

268
CHAPTER 15. SYMMETRIC POLYNOMIALS
Just as with one variable, we can define rational functions in n variables. A
rational function in x1, . . . , xn over F is a quotient f/g, where f, g ∈F[x1, . . . , xn],
g ̸= 0. We identify f/g with kf/kg for any k ∈F[x1, . . . , xn]. The set
of rational functions in x1, . . . , xn over F is denoted by F(x1, . . . , xn). If
you define addition and multiplication in the same way as for one variable, then
F(x1, . . . , xn) becomes a field, called the field of rational functions in x1, . . . , xn.
15.2
Symmetric Polynomials and Functions
A symmetric polynomial is one which is symmetric in the variables x1, . . . , xn :
Definition 15.1. A polynomial f ∈F[x1, . . . , xn] is symmetric if
f(xα(1), . . . , xα(n)) = f(x1, . . . , xn) ,
for all α ∈Sn.
For example,
x2
1x2 + x2
1x3 + x1x2
2 + x2
2x3 + x1x2
3 + x2x2
3 ∈F[x1, x2, x3]
is symmetric. It is easy to see that if f1 and f2 are symmetric, then so are f1 + f2
and f1f2. It follows that set of all symmetric polynomials in F[x1, . . . , xn] is
a subring of F[x1, . . . , xn]. A rational function h ∈F(x1, . . . , xn) is called
symmetric if
h(xα(1), . . . , xα(1)) = h(x1, . . . , xn) ,
for all α ∈Sn. The set of all symmetric functions in F(x1, . . . , xn) is a field.
Now suppose that
f(x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 ∈F[x] ,
and that f has n roots ζ1, . . . , ζn ∈F. So
f(x) = (x −ζ1) · · · (x −ζn) .

15.2. SYMMETRIC POLYNOMIALS AND FUNCTIONS
269
Expanding the product, you obtain formulas for the coefficients a0, . . . , an−1:
a0
=
(−1)nζ1 · · · ζn
...
...
an−j
=
(−1)j
∑
i1<···<ij
ζi1 · · · ζij
...
...
an−1
=
−
n
∑
j=1
ζj .
These expressions are symmetric in ζ1, . . . , ζn. The corresponding symmetric
polynomials are called the elementary symmetric polynomials:
Definition 15.2. The jth elementary symmetric polynomial in x1, . . . , xn is
sj(x1, . . . , xn) :=
∑
i1<···<ij
xi1 · · · xij ,
for 1 ≤j ≤n.
Thus
an−j = (−1)jsj(ζ1, . . . , ζn) .
The second reason that elementary symmetric polynomials are important is
that every symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of them. The proof
actually gives an algorithm for doing so. Let's see how it works in an example
before looking at the general case. Take
h(x1, x2, x3) = x3
1 + x3
2 + x3
3 .
We will write h in terms of
s1
=
x1 + x2 + x3
s2
=
x1x2 + x1x3 + x2x3
s3
=
x1x2x3 .

1. Then
h = s3
1 −3(x2
1x2 + x2
1x3 + x2
2x3 + x1x2
2 + x1x2
3 + x2x2
3) −6x1x2x3 .
Now the first term in the difference h −s3
1 is x2
1x2. This occurs only in s1s2,
and
h = s3
1 −3s1s2 + 3x1x2x3 .
Of course what remains on the right hand side is just 3s3. So we end up with
h = s3
1 −3s1s2 + 3s3 .
To carry out this procedure for an arbitrary symmetric polynomial we will
have to argue by induction. For this, we must order the monomials. The sim-
plest way to do so is to order them lexicographically . Suppose that we have two
monomials, xi1
1 · · · xin
n and xj1
1 · · · xjn
n . Then we define
xi1
1 · · · xin
n
≻xj1
1 · · · xjn
n ,
if
i1 = j1 , . . . , ir = jr , but ir+1 > ir+1 .
for some r, 1 ≤r < n. So for example,
x3
1 ≻x2
1x2 ≻x2
1x3 ≻x1x2
2 .
This ordering has the property that, for any two monomials m1 and m2, either
m1 ≻m2
or
m1 = m2
or
m2 ≻m1 .
Notice that the greatest monomial in sj is x1 · · · xj . Therefore in an expression
sj1
1 sj2
2 · · · sjn
n ,
the greatest monomial will be
xj1
1 (xj2
1 xj2
2 ) · · · (xjn
1 · · · xjn
n ) = xj1+j2+···+jn

xj2+···+jn

15.2. SYMMETRIC POLYNOMIALS AND FUNCTIONS
271
Now let f be a symmetric polynomial in x1, . . . , xn. Order its monomials
lexicographically. Suppose that xi1
1 · · · xin
n is the greatest monomial that occurs
in f. To write it in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, we compare
its exponents with those of the monomial (15.1). This gives us the system of
linear equations:
i1
=
j1 + j2 + · · · + jn
i2
=
j2 + · · · + jn

jn .
This system is easy to solve and has the unique solution:
j1
=
i1 −i2
j2
=
i2 −i3

Therefore we must use si1−i2

ference

is again a symmetric polynomial, and only has lesser monomials in it. So arguing
by induction, it can be written in a unique way in terms of s1, . . . , sn. This gives
us the theorem:
Theorem 15.3 (Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials). A symmetric
polynomial f ∈F[x1, . . . , xn] can be written in a unique way as a polynomial in the
elementary symmetric polynomials.
Corollary 15.4. There are no algebraic relations among the elementary symmetric polynomi-
als.

272
CHAPTER 15. SYMMETRIC POLYNOMIALS
Proof. By an algebraic relation among s1, . . . , sn is meant a polynomial g ̸= 0 in
n variables such that g(s1, . . . , sn) = 0. If there were such a polynomial relation
among them, then there would be more than one way to express the symmetric
polynomial 0 in terms of them.
Examples 15.5.
(i) Let
f(x) = x3 + ax2 + bx + c ∈F[x] ,
with roots ζ1, ζ2 and ζ3 in F. Thus
a = −s1(ζ1, ζ2, ζ3) = −ζ1 −ζ2 −ζ3
b = s2(ζ1, ζ2, ζ3) = ζ2ζ3 + ζ1ζ3 + ζ1ζ2
c = −s3(ζ1, ζ2, ζ3) = −ζ1ζ2ζ3 .
Now we are going to see how we can write down the monic cubic g ∈F[x]
whose roots are ζ2
1, ζ2
2 and ζ2
3, in terms of a, b and c. To do this we must
write s1(ζ2
1, ζ2
2, ζ2
3), s2(ζ2
1, ζ2
2, ζ2
3) and s3(ζ2
1, ζ2
2, ζ2
3) in terms of a, b and
c. We have
s1(ζ2
1, ζ2
2, ζ2
3) = ζ2
1 + ζ2
2 + ζ2
3
= (ζ1 + ζ2 + ζ3)2 −2(ζ2ζ3 + ζ1ζ3 + ζ1ζ2)
= a2 −2b
s2(ζ2
1, ζ2
2, ζ2
3) = ζ2
2ζ2
3 + ζ2
1ζ2
3 + ζ2
1ζ2
2
= (ζ2ζ3 + ζ1ζ3 + ζ1ζ2)2 −2(ζ2
1ζ2ζ3 + ζ1ζ2
2ζ3 + ζ1ζ2ζ2
3)
= (ζ2ζ3 + ζ1ζ3 + ζ1ζ2)2 −2(ζ1ζ2ζ3)(ζ1 + ζ2 + ζ3)
= b2 −2ac
s3(ζ2
1, ζ2
2, ζ2
3) = ζ2
1ζ2
2ζ2
3
= c2 .
Therefore the cubic g is given by
g(x) = x3 −s1(ζ2
1, ζ2
2, ζ2
3)x2 + s2(ζ2
1, ζ2
2, ζ2
3)x −s3(ζ2

2, ζ2
3)
= x3 −(a2 −2b)x2 + (b2 −2ac)x −c2 .

15.2. SYMMETRIC POLYNOMIALS AND FUNCTIONS
273
(ii) Suppose we have a polynomial
f(x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 ∈F[x] ,
with roots ζ1, . . . , ζn ∈F, none of which are 0. Then we can write down a
monic polynomial g ∈F[x] whose roots are the reciprocals 1/ζ1, . . . , 1/ζn ,
in terms of a0, . . . , an−1 . What we must do is to express sk(1/ζ1, . . . , 1/ζn) ,
0 ≤k < n, in terms of a0, . . . , an−1 . Well,
sk(1/ζ1, . . . , 1/ζn) =
∑
i1<···<ik
1
ζi1 · · · ζik
If we multiply this by (ζ1 · · · ζn) we obtain
(ζ1 · · · ζn) sk(1/ζ1, . . . , 1/ζn) =
∑
j1<···<jn−k
ζj1 · · · ζjn−k
Therefore
sk(1/ζ1, . . . , 1/ζn) = sn−k(ζ1, . . . , ζn)/sn(ζ1, . . . , ζn)
= (−1)kak/a0 .
It follows that
g(x) = xn + · · · + (an−k/a0)xk + · · · + (1/a0) .
Now that we have the answer it is clear that we could get it more easily:
xnf
(1
x
)
= 1 + · · · + an−kxk + · · · + a0xn = a0g(x) ,
and the roots of xnf(1/x) are 1/ζ1, . . . , 1/ζn .

By the fundamental theorem there must be formulas which express p1, . . . , pn in

15.4. DISCRIMINANTS
275
Notice that if chr F = 0, then these identities also allow us to write s1, . . . , sn
in terms of p1, . . . , pn .
15.4
Discriminants
Let F be a field of characteristic ̸= 2 and f(x) = x2 + a1 x + a0 ∈F[x], a
quadratic polynomial with roots ζ1 and ζ2 in F. By completing the square, we
get the well-known formula:
ζ1 = −a1 +
√
∆
2
,
ζ2 = −a1 −
√
∆
2
,
where ∆= a2
1 −4a0 is the discriminant of f. This formula tells us that
∆= (ζ1 −ζ2)2 .
Now suppose that f ∈F[x] is a polynomial of degree n with roots ζ1, . . . , ζn ∈
F. By analogy,
∆:=
∏
i<j
(ζi −ζj)2 = (−1)n(n−1)/2 ∏
i̸=j
(ζi −ζj)
is called the discriminant of f. The most obvious property of ∆is that it is non-
zero if and only if the roots of f are distinct. In the chapters to come we shall
see some of its more subtle properties.
Interchanging two roots ζi and ζj does not change ∆. Since Sn is generated
by the set of all transpositions, ∆is therefore symmetric in ζ1, . . . , ζn. So define
a polynomial
∆(x1, . . . , xn) :=
∏
i<j
(xi −xj)2 ∈F[x1, . . . , xn] .
Then ∆is symmetric in x1, . . . , xn. Using the algorithm above, you can compute
that
∆(x1, x2, x3) = s2

CHAPTER 15. SYMMETRIC POLYNOMIALS
With software it is easy to calculate ∆(x1, . . . , xn) in terms of the elementary
symmetric polynomials for larger n. Notice that the polynomial
δ(x1, . . . , xn) :=
∏
i<j
(xi −xj)
is not symmetric. If you interchange two variables you get −δ(x1, . . . , xn) (see
exercise 11).
15.5
Software
Mathematica has a function SymmetricReduction which implements the algorithm
in theorem 15.3. It requires that you list the variables in your symmetric polyno-
mial, and name the elementary symmetric polynomials. Here is p3 in terms of
s1, s2 and s3:

Actually the function will take an arbitrary polynomial and write it as symmetric
polynomial and a remainder. This is where the second term 0 comes from. If
you are only interested in symmetric polynomials, you can get rid of the zero
remainder by applying the function First:
In[2]:= First[%]

Roots of Equations
16.1
Introduction
In this chapter and the following ones, we are going to discuss solving polynomial
equations. For a quadratic equation, it is easy to write down a formula for the
roots. This formula tells you a lot about them and is very useful. There is a similar
formula for the roots of a cubic. But it is more complicated, less informative and
less useful (see chapter 20). For quartics this is even more so, and for equations
of degree greater than 4, such formulas do not even exist. So in trying to describe
the solutions of an equation we will take a different approach, namely the one
outlined in the introduction to chapter 14.
As we saw in chapter 7, algebraic relations among the roots are important.
First, let's be more precise about what we mean by this. To make things more
concrete, suppose f(x) = xn +· · ·+a1x+a0 ∈Q[x]. According to the funda-
mental theorem of algebra, f has n complex roots, ζ1, . . . , ζn. Then an algebraic
relation among the roots is a polynomial g in n variables with coefficients in Q
such that g(ζ1, . . . , ζn) = 0. Examples of such relations are
sj(ζ1, . . . , ζn) = (−1)jan−j .
for 1 ≤j ≤n. These hold for any f. But there may well be others for a
particular polynomial.
Now it is awkward to work directly with these relations. But there is an ap-
proach which works amazingly well. The basic idea is the following. The roots
281

282
CHAPTER 16. ROOTS OF EQUATIONS
of the polynomial f lie in C, which is a very large field. In fact they lie in a much
smaller field. If we look at the smallest field containing them, we will see that its
algebraic structure is determined by the algebraic relations among the roots. It is
this field, called the splitting field of f, which we will study. A few examples will
make clearer what this means.
Examples 16.1.
(i) f(x) = x2 −2 ∈Q[x]. The roots of f are ±
√
2 ∈
C . These lie in the field Q(
√
2). And this is clearly the smallest field
containing Q and the two roots. Elements of Q(
√
2) are of the form
a + b
√
2, a, b ∈Q, and the multiplication in Q(
√
2) is determined by the
relation
(
√
2)2 = 2 .
(ii) Let f(x) = x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1 ∈Q[x]. As we saw in chapter 7, the
roots of f are
ζ1 = e2πi/5 , ζ2 = e4πi/5 , ζ3 = e6πi/5 , ζ4 = e8πi/5 .
These satisfy the relations determined by the symmetric polynomials. They
also satisfy
ζ2 = ζ2
1 ,
ζ3 = ζ3
1 ,
ζ4 = ζ4
1 .
Let's set ω := ζ1. Then all the roots lie in the field Q(ω)
(
see example
14.17(iv)
)
, and this is the smallest field containing Q and the four roots.
Elements of Q(ω) are of the form a0 + a1ω + a2ω2 + a3ω3, and multi-
plication in Q(ω) is determined by the relation
−1 = s1(ζ1, ζ2, ζ3, ζ4) = ζ1 + ζ2 + ζ3 + ζ4 = ω + ω2 + ω3 + ω4 .
In general, given f ∈Q[x] with roots ζ1, . . . , ζn ∈C, let
Q(ζ1, . . . , ζn) := {g(ζ1, . . . , ζn) ∈C} ,
where g = h/k is a rational function, with h, k ∈Q[x1, . . . , xn] and k(ζ1, . . . , ζn)
̸= 0. It is not hard to see that Q(ζ1, . . . , ζn) is a field, and in fact
Q(ζ1, . . . , ζn) = ∩{K | Q ⊂K ⊂C, ζ1, . . . , ζn ∈K, K a field} .

16.2. EXTENSION FIELDS
283
In other words, Q(ζ1, . . . , ζn) is the smallest field containing ζ1, . . . , ζn and Q.
The relations among the roots determine the structure of this field. However,
this is too vague to be of much use. So we will develop a clearer, more precise
description.
In the examples, we have extended the field Q to obtain a larger field con-
taining the roots of f. These fields are called extension fields of Q. As was
mentioned, the relative size of an extension field is important. There is a simple
way of measuring this. Such a field is a Q -vector space. So we can measure its
size by its dimension. In the first example it is 2, and in the second, 4. In general,
Q(ζ1, . . . , ζn) is finite dimensional. On the other hand, the dimension of C as a
Q -vector space is uncountably infinite. So in this sense, C is a very large field,
and Q(ζ1, . . . , ζn), a much smaller one.
16.2
Extension Fields
Definition 16.2. Let E and F be fields, with E ⊃F. Then E is called an
extension field of F, and F, a subfield of E.
One often refers to the extension E over F, written E/F. So Q(
√
2) and Q(ω)
are extension fields of Q and they are subfields of C. In example 14.22(iii), Fp is
embedded in Fp2 as the set of diagonal matrices:
Fp ∼=
{(a
0
0
a
)  a ∈Fp
}
⊂
{( a
b
br
a
)  a, b ∈Fp
}
= Fp2 .
These are all examples of simple extensions. An extension E/F is called simple
if there exists an element ζ ∈E such that
E = F(ζ) := {g(ζ)/h(ζ) | g, h ∈F[x], h(ζ) ̸= 0} .
We say that F(ζ) is obtained from F by adjoining ζ. Simple extensions can be
described precisely, which makes them very useful.

284
CHAPTER 16. ROOTS OF EQUATIONS
Theorem 16.3. Suppose E = F(ζ), for some ζ ∈E. Then either
F(ζ) ∼= F[x]/(f) ,
for some irreducible polynomial f ∈F[x], or
F(ζ) ∼= F(x) ,
the field of  rational functions in x.
Proof. Suppose there exists f ∈F[x], f ̸= 0, such that f(ζ) = 0. Pick one of
minimal degree. This f will be irreducible: for if f = gh, with deg g, deg h <
deg f, then either g(ζ) = 0 or h(ζ) = 0. We have the evaluation map (see
remark 14.23)
ϵζ : F[x] →F(ζ)
given by
ϵζ(g) = g(ζ) ,
which induces an isomorphism
¯ϵζ : F[x]/(f) →F(ζ) .
The other possibility is that f(ζ) ̸= 0 for all f ∈F[x], f ̸= 0. We define
ϵζ : F[x] →f(ζ) as above. But now we can extend it to F(x) by setting
ϵζ(g/h) = g(ζ)/h(ζ) ,
for any g, h ∈F[x], h ̸= 0. This gives a homomorphism, whose image again is
an extension of F containing ζ. Therefore it must be all of F(ζ).
In the first case the polynomial f chosen in the proof can be taken to be
monic. It is then called the minimal polynomial of ζ. Its degree is called the degree
of ζ.
Corollary 16.4. If E/F is an extension, and ζ ∈E, with g(ζ) = 0 for some g ∈F[x],
then g is divisible by the minimal polynomial of ζ.

16.2. EXTENSION FIELDS
285
Proof. If g(ζ) = 0, then ¯ϵζ(g) = 0, which means that ¯g = 0 ∈F[x]/(f). In
other words, g ∈(f) or f | g.
In general, if E/F is an extension and ζ ∈E, one says that ζ is algebraic over
F if there exists f ∈F[x] such that f(ζ) = 0. If no such f exists, one says that
ζ is transcendental over F. If ζ is algebraic over Q, then ζ is called an algebraic
number, and if it is transcendental over Q, a transcendental number. It is not hard to
see that there are countably many algebraic numbers. So there are uncountably
many transcendental numbers. For example, π and e are transcendental. Yet it is
very hard to prove that a complex number is transcendental (see [1], §6.3 )
Let's look at a slightly more complicated example:
Example 16.5. Let f(x) = x3 −2. Clearly
3√
2 ∈R is a root of f. If ω is a
cube root of 1, then ω
3√
2 is also a root of f. So let ω = e2πi/3. Then
3√
2 ,
ω
3√
2 ,
ω2 3√
2
∈C
are the roots of f. We want to describe Q(
3√
2, ω
3√
2, ω2 3√
2). Now
Q(
3√
2) ⊂R ,
but
ω
3√
2, ω2 3√
2 ̸∈R
So
ω
3√
2, ω2 3√
2 ̸∈Q(
3√
2) .
Any field containing all 3 roots must contain
ω
3√
2
/ 3√
2 = ω .
So let's adjoin ω to Q(
3√
2) . Then
E := Q(
3√
2)(ω) = Q(
3√
2, ω) ⊂Q(
3√
2, ω
3√
2, ω2 3√
2) ,
and on the other hand, E will contain ω
3√
2 and ω2 3√
2. So
Q(
3√
2, ω
3√
2, ω2 3√
2) = Q(
3√
2, ω) .
Can you describe Q(
3√
2, ω) as a simple extension?

CHAPTER 16. ROOTS OF EQUATIONS
In general, suppose that E/F is a field extension, and ζ1, . . . , ζr ∈E. Then
we can define the extension
F(ζ1, . . . , ζr) = F(ζ1) . . . (ζr) ⊂E
= ∩{K | F ⊂K ⊂E , ζ1, . . . , ζr ∈K}
= {g(ζ1, . . . , ζr) ∈E} ,
where g = h/k is a rational function, with h, k ∈F[x1, . . . , xn] and
k(ζ1, . . . , ζn) ̸= 0. We say that F(ζ1, . . . , ζr) is obtained from F by adjoining
ζ1, . . . , ζr.
16.3
Degree of  an Extension
If E is an extension of F, then E is an F-vector space:
(i) for ζ, η ∈E, define vector addition to be field addition in E
ζ + η := ζ + η ∈E .
(ii) for a ∈F and ζ ∈E, define scalar multiplication using the field multipli-
cation in E
aζ := aζ ∈E .
It is straightforward to check that E with these two operations is an F-vector
space.
Definition 16.6. Let E/F be a field extension. Then the degree of the extension,
written [E : F], is the dimension of E as an F-vector space, that is,
[E : F] := dimF E .
If [E : F] < ∞then E/F is called a finite extension.

16.3. DEGREE OF AN EXTENSION
287
If f ∈F[x] is irreducible then we saw in the previous chapter that the di-
mension of the simple extension E constructed from f is deg f. So in this case,
[E : F] = deg f .
In our first example,
[
Q(
√
2) : Q
]
= 2 ,
with basis
{1,
√
2} .
In the second one,
[
Q(ω) : Q
]
= 4 ,
where ω = e2πi/5, and
{1, ω, ω2, ω3}
is a basis. In the third example,
[
Fp2 : Fp
]
= 2 .
and
{
1,
(0

)}
is a basis.
In example 16.5, we have
Q ⊂Q(
3√
2) ⊂Q(
3√

It is clear that
[
Q(
3√

]
= 3
with basis
{1,

What about
[
Q(
3√
2, ω) : Q(
3√

]
? Well, ω is a root of x2 + x + 1 which is
irreducible in R[x]. Therefore it is irreducible over Q(
3√
2) and
[
Q(
3√

= 2

We would also like to compute
[
Q(

. It is not obvious that Q(
3√
2, ω)/Q
is a simple extension. But the following result shows that we can calculate its de-
gree from
[
Q(

and
[
Q(

Theorem 16.7. Let D ⊃E ⊃F be fields. Then
[D : F] = [D : E][E : F] .
Proof. First, let's assume that [D : E] and [E : F] are both finite. So suppose
that
S = {ζ1, . . . , ζs}
is a basis of D over E, and
T = {η1, . . . , ηt} ,
a basis of E over F. Set
U = {ζjηk ∈D | 1 ≤j ≤s, 1 ≤k ≤t} .
We want to show that U is a basis of D/F. First we show that it generates D/F.
Pick θ ∈D. Since S is a set of generators of D over E, there exist α1, . . . αs ∈E
such that
θ = α1ζ1 + · · · + αsζs .
Now T generates E over F. So for each j, 1 ≤j ≤s, there exist βjk ∈F,
1 ≤k ≤t, such that
αj = βj1η1 + · · · + βjtηt .
Therefore
θ =
s
∑
j=1
t
∑
k=1
βjk(ζjηk) .
So U generates D over F.

16.3. DEGREE OF AN EXTENSION
289
Now we check that U is linearly independent over F. Suppose that
0 =
s
∑
j=1
t
∑
k=1
βjk(ζjηk) =
s
∑
j=1
(
t
∑
k=1

)
ζj
for some βjk ∈F, 1 ≤j ≤s, 1 ≤k ≤t. Since S is linearly independent over
E, the coefficients of ζ1, . . . , ζs must be 0, in other words,
βj1η1 + · · · + βjtηt = 0 ,
for 1 ≤j ≤s . But {η1, . . . , ηt} are linearly independent over F. Therefore
βjk = 0 for all j, k. So U is linearly independent over F and is therefore a basis
of D/F. It follows that
[D : E][E : F] = [D : F] ,
if all three are finite.
If one of [D : E] or [E : F] is infinite, then [D : F] is infinite.
We now can compute [Q(
3√
2, ω) : Q]:
[
Q(
3√
2, ω) : Q
]
=
[
Q(
3√
2, ω) : Q(
3√
2)
][
Q(
3√
2) : Q
]
= 2 · 3 = 6 .
Using the bases for Q(
3√
2)/Q and Q(
3√
2, ω)/Q(
3√
2) given above, the basis
constructed in the theorem is
{1,
3√
2, (
3√
2)2, ω, ω
3√
2, ω(
3√

Example 16.8. Take f(x) = x4 −10x2 + 1 (see chapter 7). Its roots are

Any subfield of R containing the four roots contains
√
2 and
√
3 and vice versa.
So the smallest field containing the roots is Q(
√
2,
√
3). From the theorem,
[
Q(
√

√

]
=
[
Q(

Q(

= 2 · 2 = 4 ,

290
CHAPTER 16. ROOTS OF EQUATIONS
since x2 −3 has no root in Q(
√
2).
In fact it is not hard to see that Q(
√
2,
√
3)/Q is a simple extension. We
have
Q(
√
2 +
√

√

√

A short calculation shows that we can express
√

√

√

and its powers:
(

and

Thus

and

Therefore
Q(

16.4
Splitting Fields
We can now say more about the smallest extension field containing the roots of
a polynomial. Suppose that F is a field, and f a polynomial of degree n with
coefficients in F. We say that f splits in an extension E of F if f has n roots
ζ1, . . . , ζn ∈E, or equivalently,
f(x) = (x −ζ1) · · · (x −ζn) ∈E[x] .
We want to show that any polynomial f ∈F[x] splits in some extension of F.
The smallest such extension is called a splitting field of f. This is the smallest field
containing all the roots of f.
For example,

16.4. SPLITTING FIELDS
291
(i) Q(
√
2) is the splitting field of x2 −2 ∈Q[x]
(ii) Q(ω), where ω = e2πi/5, is the splitting field of x4+x3+x2+x+1 ∈Q[x]
(iii) Q(
3√
2, ω) is the splitting field of x3 −2 ∈Q[x]
(iv) Q(
√
2,
√
3) is the splitting field of x4 −10x2 + 1 ∈Q[x]
As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, the structure of the splitting
field reflects precisely the algebraic relations among the roots of the polynomial.
In the next chapter we will use splitting fields to study the symmetries of the
roots.
An obvious question to ask is, does a splitting field for a polynomial f ∈F[x]
always exist. If the answer is yes, then we can ask whether it is unique or not. In
examples (i) and (ii) above, we were able to construct a splitting field by adjoining
one root to the field F. In example (iii), we had to adjoin a second root. This
suggests how we can construct splitting fields in general. Uniqueness of splitting
fields will be discussed in the next chapter.
Theorem 16.9. Let f ∈F[x] be a polynomial of  degree n. There exists a splitting field
E/F of f with [E : F] ≤n!.
Proof. We first assume that f is irreducible and argue by induction on n. If n = 1,
then f is linear and its only root lies in F. So suppose that the result holds for
irreducible polynomials of degree at most n −1. Set
E = F[x]/(f) .
In E, f has at least one root. So we can write
f(x) = (x −ζ1) · · · (x −ζr)g(x) ∈E[x] ,

292
CHAPTER 16. ROOTS OF EQUATIONS
with ζ1, . . . , ζr ∈E, and g ∈E[x] irreducible. Since deg g < n, by the induc-
tion assumption the result applies to g. Thus there exists a splitting field D/E
for g with
[D : E] ≤(n −r)! .
If
g(x) = (x −ζr+1) · · · (x −ζn) ∈D[x] ,
then
f(x) = (x −ζ1) · · · (x −ζn) ∈D[x] ,
in other words, f splits in D. The field D then contains a splitting field E′ of f
with
[E′ : F] ≤[D : F] = [D : E][E : F] ≤(n −r)!n ≤n! ,
as desired. If f is reducible, we can apply the result for irreducible polynomials
to each irreducible factor of f. It is not hard to see that here too, the degree of
the splitting field is at most n!.
Example 16.10. Consider f(x) = xp −2, where p is prime. We have already
looked at p = 3. First, there is a real root,
p√
2. Furthermore, if ωp = 1, then
ω
p√
2 is also a root of f. So pick a pth root of 1, ω ̸= 1, for example ω = e2πi/p.
Then the remaining pth roots of 2 are ωj p√
2, 1 < j < p . As in the case p = 3,
we see that if an extension field contains all the roots, then it must contain
ω
p√
2
/ p√
2 = ω .
Conversely, if it contains
p√
2 and ω, then it contains all the roots. So the splitting
field of f is
Q(
p√
2, ω) .
To calculate
[
Q(
p√
2, ω) : Q
]
, first note that
[
Q(
p√
2) : Q
]
= p .
So
p

[
Q(
p√
2) : Q
][
Q(
p√
2, ω) : Q
]
=
[
Q(
p√
2, ω) : Q(
p√
2)
]
.

16.4. SPLITTING FIELDS
293
And since ω is a root of xp−1 + · · · + x + 1 ,
[
Q(
p√
2, ω) : Q(
p√
2)
]
≤p −1 .
Therefore
[
Q(
p√
2, ω) : Q
]
≤(p −1)p .
On the other hand,
[
Q(ω) : Q
]
= p −1
since xp−1 + · · · + x + 1 is the minimal polynomial of ω over Q, and
[
Q(ω) : Q
] 
[
Q(
p√
2, ω) : Q
]
.
Therefore both p and p −1 divide
[
Q(
p√
2, ω) : Q
]
. Since they are relatively
prime, we have
(p −1)p

[
Q(
p√
2, ω) : Q
]
.
Thus
[
Q(
p√
2, ω) : Q
]
= (p −1)p .
The diagram below shows the relationships between the four fields, and the de-
grees of the extensions.

Cubics
Let F be a field of characteristic ̸= 2 and f(x) = x2 + a1 x + a0 ∈F[x],
a quadratic polynomial. On page 275 we recalled the standard formula for its
roots ζ1 and ζ2. You can also write this in a slightly different way:
ζ1 = −a1 + δ
2
,
ζ2 = −a1 −δ
2
,
where δ =
√
a2
1 −4a0 is a square root of the discriminant of f. This formula
tells us that
δ = ζ1 −ζ2 ,
and that F(δ) is a splitting field of f over F.
Now suppose that
f = x3 + a2 x2 + a1 x + a0 ∈F[x]
is a cubic with 3 distinct roots ζ1, ζ2, and ζ3 in some extension E/F. So we can
write
f(x) = (x −ζ1)(x −ζ2)(x −ζ3) ∈E[x] .
Set
δ := (ζ1 −ζ2)(ζ2 −ζ3)(ζ1 −ζ3) ∈E .
So ∆= δ2 is the discriminant of f. It is not hard to see that ∆∈F. If we pick
one root, say ζ1, then we can express the other two in terms of it and δ. First, we
have
−a2 = ζ1 + ζ2 + ζ3 ,
which gives us
ζ2 + ζ3 = −a2 −ζ1 .
(16.1)
Furthermore,
f ′(x) = (x −ζ2)(x −ζ3) + (x −ζ1)(x −ζ3) + (x −ζ1)(x −ζ2) ,

16.5. CUBICS
295
so that
f ′(ζ1) = (ζ1 −ζ2)(ζ1 −ζ3) .
Therefore,
ζ3 −ζ2 =
δ
f ′(ζ1) .
Combining this with equation (16.1), we get
ζ2 = −a2
2 −ζ1
2 −
δ
2f ′(ζ1)
ζ3 = −a2
2 −ζ1
2 +
δ
2f ′(ζ1)
.
(16.2)
Thus F(δ, ζ1) is a splitting field for f over F. One should think of this as F(δ)
with a root of f adjoined. If f is irreducible over F, then
[
F(δ, ζ1) : F
]
= 3 or 6 ,
depending upon whether δ ∈F or δ ̸∈F.
For example, take f(x) = x3 −2 ∈Q[x]. As we saw in example 16.5, the
roots are
ζ1 =
3√
2 ,
ζ2 = ω
3√
2 ,
ζ3 = ω2 3√
2 ,
where ω = e2πi/3. So
δ = (
3√
2 −ω
3√
2)(ω
3√
2 −ω2 3√
2)(
3√
2 −ω2 3√
2)
= 2(1 −ω)(ω −ω2)(1 −ω2)
= 6 + 12ω ,
and Q(δ, ζ1) = Q(ω,
3√
2) is the splitting field again.
Remark 16.11. If f is a real quadratic then the discriminant controls whether the
roots are real: if ∆is positive, then f has 2 real roots. If ∆is negative, then f has
a pair of complex conjugate roots. For a cubic f ∈R[x] the discriminant has a
similar significance. A real cubic always has a real root. So take ζ1 to be this root.
Then formula (16.2) shows that the other 2 roots are real if the discriminant is
positive, and complex conjugate if it is negative. The discriminant of real cubics
is discussed further on page 302.

296
CHAPTER 16. ROOTS OF EQUATIONS
16.6
Cyclotomic Polynomials
We have been making much use of roots of unity. In this section, we are going
to discuss their minimal polynomials, called cyclotomic polynomials.
As we saw in exercise 6.2, the nth roots of 1 form a cyclic group µn of order
n. A primitive nth root of 1 is one which generates the group. If we write µn as
{e2πik/n | 0 < k ≤n} ⊂C ,
then the primitive roots are those with (k, n) = 1. Thus there are φ(n) of them
(see chapter 1).
Here is a plot of the 18th roots of 1 and the primitive 18th roots of 1 in the
complex plane.
.
We define the nth cyclotomic polynomial Φn(x) to be the monic polynomial
whose roots are the primitive nth roots of 1, that is
Φn(x) =
∏
ω primitive
nth root of 1
(x −ω) =
∏
(k,n)=1
0<k<n
(x −e2πik/n) .
If ω is an nth root of 1, and the order of ω in µn is d, then d | n and ω is a
primitive dth root of 1. Conversely, if d | n and ω is a primitive dth root of 1,

16.6. CYCLOTOMIC POLYNOMIALS
297
then ω is an nth root of 1 whose order is d. Therefore, sorting the roots by their
order, we see that
xn −1 =
∏
ωn=1
(x −ω) =
∏
d|n
∏
ω primitive
dth root of 1
(x −ω) =
∏
d|n
Φd(x) .
(16.3)
Using this formula, we can compute the cyclotomic polynomials recursively. We
have
x −1 = Φ1(x) ,
and
x2 −1 = Φ1(x)Φ2(x) = (x −1)Φ2(x) .
Therefore
Φ2(x) = x + 1 .
Next,
x3 −1 = Φ1(x)Φ3(x) = (x −1)Φ3(x) .
So
Φ3(x) = x2 + x + 1 .
In fact, for any prime p,
xp −1 = (x −1)Φp(x) ,
and thus
Φp(x) = xp−1 + · · · + x + 1 .
Going on, we have
x4 −1 = Φ1(x)Φ2(x)Φ4(x) = (x −1)(x + 1)Φ4(x) .
Therefore
Φ4(x) = x2 + 1 .
And
x6 −1 = Φ1(x)Φ2(x)Φ3(x)Φ6(x) = (x −1)(x + 1)(x2 + x + 1)Φ6(x) ,

298
CHAPTER 16. ROOTS OF EQUATIONS
which tells us that
Φ6(x) = x2 −x + 1 .
You can continue like this. You can also use software to compute Φn for much
larger values of n. Looking at these calculations the first thing you notice is that
all the cyclotomic polynomials computed have integer coefficients.
Theorem 16.12. The cyclotomic polynomials Φn have integer coefficients and are monic, for
all n ∈N.
Proof. To see this, we argue by induction on n. It is certainly true for n = 1.
Suppose that all Φd for d < n, have integer coefficients and are monic. Therefore
g(x) :=
∏
d|n
d<n
Φd(x)
is monic with integer coefficients. By formula (16.3), we have
xn −1 = g(x)Φn(x) .
It follows that Φn too must have integer coefficients and be monic (see exercise
14.8). So by the principle of induction, the first statement is proved.
Remark 16.13. Calculations of Φn for small n may lead you to ask whether its
coefficients are ±1 for all n. This is not the case. For example,
Φ105(x) = 1 + x + x2 −x5 −x6 −2 x7 −x8 −x9 + x12 + x13 + x14
+ x15 + x16 + x17 −x20 −x22 −x24 −x26 −x28 + x31
+ x32 + x33 + x34 + x35 + x36 −x39 −x40 −2 x41 −x42
−x43 + x46 + x47 + x48 .
In fact arbitrarily large and small integers occur as coefficients of cyclotomic
polynomials.
Looking again at our calculations of cyclotomic polynomials, you notice that
Φ3, Φ4 and Φ6 are irreducible over Q. In 14.14 we saw that Φp is irreducible. So
one might ask whether this is true for all Φn.

16.6. CYCLOTOMIC POLYNOMIALS
299
Theorem 16.14. The cyclotomic polynomials Φn are irreducible over Q, for all n ∈N.
Proof. Suppose that f ∈Q[x] is monic, irreducible, and divides Φn. It follows
from exercise 14.8 that f has integer coefficients. Since Φn divides xn −1, so
does f. Write
xn −1 = f(x)g(x) .
for some g with integer coefficients. Now let ω be a primitive nth root of 1 which
is a root of f. Thus f is the minimal polynomial of ω. Pick a prime p which does
not divide n. Then
0 = (ωp)n −1 = f(ωp)g(ωp) .
So either f(ωp) = 0 or g(ωp) = 0.
Suppose that g(ωp) = 0. Then ω is a root of g(xp). It follows from corollary
16.4 that f(x) | g(xp), say
g(xp) = f(x)h(x) ,
where h too has integer coefficients. Next, reduce this equation mod p:
¯g(xp) = ¯f(x)¯h(x) .
Since ¯g(xp) = ¯g(x)p (see exercise 14.21), we have
¯g(x)p = ¯f(x)¯h(x) .
Now in Fp[x], every polynomial factors uniquely into a product of irreducibles
(theorem 14.11). Therefore some irreducible factor k ∈Fp[x] of ¯g is also a
factor of ¯f. Hence
k2 | ¯f¯g = ¯xn −1 .
But if ¯xn −1 has a repeated factor, then by exercise 14.20,
(¯xn −1, n¯xn−1) ̸= 1 ,
which is impossible. It follows that ωp must be a root of f for every prime p ∤n.

300
CHAPTER 16. ROOTS OF EQUATIONS
We want to see that ωr is a root of f for every r relatively prime to n. Suppose
that r = p1 · · · pl, where p1, . . . , pl are primes which do not divide n. Now in
the argument above, we can replace ω by ωp1, since it too is a primitive nth root
of 1. It follows that (ωp
1)p2 = ωp1p2 is a root of f. Continuing like this we see
that ωr is as well. Since every root of Φn is of this form, we must have that
f = Φn, and so Φn is irreducible.
Since µn is a cyclic group, an extension of Q which contains one primitive
nth root contains all of them. So the splitting field En of Φn is isomorphic to
Q[x]/(Φn) . It contains all nth roots of 1 and is thus the splitting field of xn −1
as well. Furthermore,
[
En : Q
]
= φ(n) .
En is called a cyclotomic field.
16.7
Finite Fields
Let's now look more closely at the case where F is a field of characteristic p, in
particular where F is finite with q elements. Suppose that E/F is an extension
of degree r. For example, if f ∈F[x] is irreducible of degree r, then F[x]/(f)
is such a field. Since [E : F] = r,
|E| = qr
(see exercise 14.15). It follows that
|E×| = qr −1 .
So if ζ ∈E×,
ζqr−1 = 1 .
Therefore, for all ζ ∈E, (cf. Fermat's little theorem)
ζqr = ζ .

16.7. FINITE FIELDS

This tells us that xqr −x has qr roots in E. So E is in fact a splitting field for
xqr −x over F. We are going to show in the next chapter that splitting fields are
unique up to isomorphism. This means that all extensions E/F of degree r are
isomorphic. So given the uniqueness result, we have:
Theorem 16.15. There is a unique field of  order pr, for p prime, r ∈N.
For example, Fp2 is the field with p2 elements, and is the splitting field over
Fp of xp2 −x. In general, let's denote by Fpr, the field with pr elements. If r | s,
then there is an extension of degree s/r of Fpr. It has pr(s/r) = ps elements,
and is therefore just Fps. The converse also holds: if Fps is an extension of Fpr,
then r | s.
This discussion also tells us something about the irreducible polynomials over
Fp. Suppose f ∈Fp is monic and irreducible of degree r, and r | s. Since
Fp[x]/(f) ∼= Fpr, f is the minimal polynomial of some element ζ ∈Fpr. As
Fpr ⊂Fps,
ζps −ζ = 0 .
Therefore by corollary 16.4,
f | (xps −x) .
Since any two distinct monic, irreducible polynomials are relatively prime, it fol-
lows that
∏
f irreducible
f monic
deg f | s
f
 (xps −x) .
Conversely, suppose that f is a monic, irreducible factor of degree r of xps −x
. Since xps −x splits in Fps, so does f. Pick a root of ζ of f. Then
Fpr ∼= Fp[x]/(f) ∼= Fp(ζ) ⊂Fps .
So r | s and all the factors of xps −x occur in the product above. Since the
leading coefficient of the product is 1, we have the result:

Corollary 16.17. Let N(p, r) be the number of  irreducible monic polynomials in Fp[x] of
degree r. Then
ps =

N(p, r)r .
Proof. The degree of the left hand side of the equation in the theorem is ps. The
degree of the right hand side is ∑
r|s N(p, r)r .
You can obtain an explicit formula for N(p, r) by using the M¨obius inversion
formula (see [1], p. 113).

Plots and Calculations
As we have seen, the discriminant ∆of a real cubic
f(x) = x3 + ax + b
is given by
∆= −4a3 −27b2 .
Here is a plot of the semi-cubical parabola ∆= 0. The regions ∆> 0, re-
spectively ∆< 0, correspond to values of a and b for which f has 3 real roots,
respectively 1 real root and a pair of complex conjugate roots.

it is negative, for a between -2 and 2, there is a pair of complex conjugate roots

are three real roots. And when it vanishes there is a double root.

Galois Groups
17.1
Introduction
In chapter 7, we looked at some examples of symmetry groups of equations. A
symmetry of an equation was defined as a permutation of its roots which pre-
served any algebraic relations among them. We were not very exact about what
we meant by 'algebraic relations among the roots'. In the last chapter, we made
this more precise, and saw that the structure of the splitting field of an equation
reflects these algebraic relations. So a natural way to define what a symmetry of
an equation should be is to say that it should be a mapping of the splitting field
to itself which preserves the structure of the field and fixes the coefficients of
the equation. As we shall show shortly, this implies that it will permute the roots.
To put it more succinctly: if we have a polynomial f with coefficients in a field
F, with a splitting field E/F, then a symmetry is an automorphism of E which
fixes F.
Let's look at the examples from chapter 7 again from this point of view. Take
f(x) = x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1 .
As we saw in example 16.1(ii) the splitting field of f is Q(ω), where ω is a prim-
itive 5th root of 1. The other roots are ω2, ω3, and ω4. Suppose that α is an
automorphism of Q(ω). Since every element of this field can be written as a
polynomial in ω, α(ω) determines α(ζ) for any ζ in the field. So what can α(ω)
311

312
CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
be? Notice that if ζ is a root of f then
0 = α(ζ4 + ζ3 + ζ2 + ζ + 1) = α(ζ)4 + α(ζ)3 + α(ζ)2 + α(ζ) + 1 .
So α(ζ) is also a root of f. Therefore α(ω) must be one of ω, ω2, ω3, or ω4.
Define automorphisms αj by
αj(ω) = ωj ,
for j = 1, 2, 3, 4. Then as we saw in chapter 7,
α2
2 = α4 ,
α3
2 = α3 ,
α4
2 = α1 = 1 .
Thus the group of automorphisms of the splitting field is cyclic of order 4.
Next take
f(x) = x4 −10x2 + 1 ∈Q[x] .
In example 16.8 we saw that the splitting field of f is Q(
√
2,
√
3). Since any
element of this field can be expressed in terms of
√
2 and
√
3, an automorphism
α is determined by α(
√
2) and α(
√
3). Now
0 = α
(
(
√

)
= α(

2)2 −2 .
Therefore
α(

2) = ±
√
2 .
Similarly, we must have that
α(
√
3) = ±
√
3 .
So there are four possibilities for α:

17.1. INTRODUCTION
313
We see that
α1 = 1
and
α4 = α2α3 .
Thus, the group of symmetries is isomorphic to V , as we saw in chapter 7.
Let's do one more example:
Example 17.1. Set f(x) = x4 −2x2 −2 ∈Q[x] (see exercise 7.12). In exercise
16.7, you saw that the roots of f are

and that the splitting field is

Now ζ1 and ζ2 satisfy the relation
ζ2
1 + ζ2
2 = 2 .

314
CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
In terms of E, this means that E has two subfields, Q(ζ1) and Q(ζ2), with
Q(ζ1) ∩Q(ζ2) = Q(ζ2
1) = Q(ζ2
2) = Q(
√
3) .
Any automorphism α of E is determined by α(ζ1) and α(ζ2), and must
satisfy
α(ζ1)2 + α(ζ2)2 = 2 .
This gives us eight possibilities for α. The last column gives the corresponding
permutation of the four roots.

The list of 8 permutations on the right is the list in the table at the beginning
of chapter 3! So the group of automorphisms of E is isomorphic to D4.
Remark 17.2. We have been using the following principle. Suppose that f ∈F[x],
and E is an extension of F containing a root ζ of f. Let α be an automorphism
of E which fixes F. Then α(ζ) is also a root of f. Why is this so? Write f out:
f(x) = anxn + · · · + a1x + a0 ,
where an, . . . , a1, a0 ∈F. So
0 = anζn + · · · + a1ζ + a0 .

17.2. DEFINITION
315
Applying α to this equation gives us
0 = α (anζn + · · · + a1ζ + a0)
= α(an)α(ζ)n + · · · + α(a1)α(ζ) + α(a0)
= anα(ζ)n + · · · + a1α(ζ) + α(a0)
= f
(
α(ζ)
)
.
Thus α permutes the roots of f.
17.2
Definition
We now are ready to make a formal definition of the group of symmetries of
an equation. Following the discussion above, we shall define it as the group of
automorphisms of its splitting field, which leave the field of coefficients invariant.
In fact we can look at this group for any extension. If E/F is a field extension,
then we say that an automorphism α of E fixes F if α(a) = a for all a ∈F. The
set of all automorphisms of E which fixes F forms a subgroup of the group of
automorphisms of E.
Definition 17.3. Let E/F be a field extension. Then the Galois group of E/F,
written Gal(E/F), is the group of automorphisms of E which fix F, in other
words
Gal(E/F) = {α | α is an automorphism of E, α(a) = a for all a ∈F} .
If E is the splitting field of a polynomial f ∈F[x], then Gal(E/F) is called the
Galois group of f, and written Gal(f).
So for f(x) = x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1,
Gal(f) = Gal
(
Q(ω)/Q
) ∼= Z/4Z ,
and for f(x) = x4 −10x2 + 1,
Gal(f) = Gal
(
Q(
√
2,
√
3)
/
Q
) ∼= V .

316
CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
Here is an example where E is not the splitting field of a polynomial: take
E = Q(
3√
2). Any automorphism of E must map
3√
2 to a cube root of 2. But
as we saw in 16.5, the other two cube roots of 2 do not lie in E. Therefore
Gal(E/Q) = {1} .
As we noted in exercise 14.10 if E is an extension of Q, then every automorphism
of E fixes Q.
Example 17.1 Continued. We computed that if f(x) = x4 −2x2 −2, then
Gal(f) = Gal(E/Q) ∼= D4 .
We can also look at the extensions E/Q(ζ1), E/Q(ζ2) and E/Q(
√
3), and com-
pute their Galois groups. Every automorphism of E which fixes Q(ζ1), Q(ζ1)
or Q(
√
3) fixes Q and therefore belongs to Gal(E/Q). So Gal
(
E/Q(ζ1)
)
,
Gal
(
E/Q(ζ2)
)
and Gal
(
E/Q(
√
3)
)
are subgroups of Gal(E/Q). Looking at
the table, we see that
Gal(E/Q(ζ1)) = ⟨α3⟩,
which is cyclic of order 2. Similarly,
Gal(E/Q(ζ2)) = ⟨α2⟩.
Now elements of Gal(E/Q(
√
3)) are automorphisms which fix ζ2
1. The table
tells us then that
Gal(E/Q(
√
3)) = {α1, α2, α3, α4} ∼= V .
Figure (17.2) shows the inclusions of these subgroups.
We have gone from diagram 17.1 to this one. You can also start from this
diagram and construct diagram 17.1, as we shall soon see.

Let's compute one example that is a little more sophisticated. We shall calcu-
late the Galois group of the cyclotomic field En/Q , the splitting field of Φn. In
the introduction we looked at the case n = 5. Pick a primitive nth root of 1, ω.
So En = Q(ω). Any element α ∈Gal(Q(ω)/Q) is determined by α(ω), which
must be another primitive nth root of 1. Thus for each j, (j, n) = 1, 1 ≤j < n,
there is an automorphism αj, defined by
αj(ω) = ωj .
For j, k relatively prime to n,
αj
(
αk(ω)
)
=
(
ωk)j = ωjk = αl(ω) ,
where 1 ≤l < n, l ≡jk (mod n). Therefore we can define a homomorphism
h : (Z/nZ)× →Gal(En/Q) = Gal(Φn)
by
h(j) = αj .

318
CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
Since the αj's are all the automorphisms of En, h is surjective. For different j's
the αj's are different. So h is injective, and therefore an isomorphism. Recall that
we discussed the structure of (Z/nZ)× in chapter 13, page 218ff. In particular,
if n is prime, then Gal(Φn) is cyclic of order n −1.
17.3
How Large is the Galois Group?
These calculations also suggest that there is a connection between [E : F] and
|Gal(E/F)|. In every example, we see that
|Gal(E/F)| ≤[E : F] ,
with equality when E is the splitting field of a polynomial f ∈F[x]. This is in
fact true if f has distinct roots. To prove it, we have to construct automorphisms
of E which fix F. Such an automorphism can be regarded as an extension of the
identity map on F to E. More generally we can look at extending an arbitrary
automorphism of F to E, or extending an isomorphism between two fields.
Theorem 17.4. Let F1 and F2 be fields, and
ψ : F1 →F2
an isomorphism. Suppose that f1 ∈F1[x] is a monic polynomial (not constant), and f2 ∈
F2[x] the corresponding polynomial under ψ. Let E1/F1 be the splitting field of f1, and
E2/F2, the splitting field of f2.
Then ψ extends to an isomorphism E1 →E2. The number of  such extensions is at most
[E1 : F1], and is exactly [E1 : F1] if  the roots of f1 in E1 are distinct .
Before starting the proof, we should clarify some points. First, if
f1(x) = anxn + · · · + a1x + a0 ,
with an, . . . , a1, a0 ∈F1, let
bj = ψ(aj) ,
0 ≤j ≤n .

17.3. HOW LARGE IS THE GALOIS GROUP?
319
Then
f2(x) = ψ∗(f1) := bnxn + · · · + b1x + b0 ∈F2[x] ,
as discussed in exercise 14.12. Secondly, as indicated above, the inequality for
|Gal(E/F)| will follow from the special case where F1 = F2 = F, ψ is the
identity on F and E1 = E2 = E. But the proof of the theorem is by induction,
and for the induction step, we need the more general result. Thirdly, if we take
F1 = F2 = F, and ψ the identity on F, and let E1 and E2 be two splitting fields
of f over F, then the theorem shows that E1 and E2 are isomorphic. In other
words, splitting fields are unique up to isomorphism. We begin with a lemma:
Lemma 17.5. Suppose that f1 (and therefore f2) is irreducible. Let ζ1 be a root of f1 in
E1. Then ψ can be extended to a homomorphism
χ : F1(ζ1) →E2 ,
and the number of  such extensions is the number of  distinct roots of f2 in E2.
Proof. From exercise 14.12, we have a ring isomorphism
ψ∗: F1[x]
∼
=
−−−→F2[x] ,
which induces an isomorphism of fields
¯ψ∗: F1[x]/(f1)
∼
=
−−−→F2[x]/(f2) .
Let ζ2 be a root of f2 in E2. As we saw in 14.23, evaluation at ζ1 and ζ2 define
isomorphisms:
¯ϵζ1 : F1[x]/(f1)
∼
=
−−−→F1(ζ1) ,
¯ϵζ2 : F2[x]/(f2)
∼
=
−−−→F2(ζ2) .
Putting all these together, we get a homomorphism
χ : F1(ζ1)
¯ϵ−1
ζ1
−−−→F1[x]/(f1)
¯ψ∗
−−−→F2[x]/(f2)
¯ϵζ2
−−−→F2(ζ2) ↩→E2 ,
which extends ψ : F1 →F2. Different roots ζ2 in E2 give different homomor-
phisms.

The theorem is proved by adjoining roots of f1 in steps and extending ψ step
by step, as in the proof of the existence of splitting fields.
Proof. We argue by induction on n := [E1 : F1]. If f1 is linear, then there is
nothing to prove. Assume that the result holds for splitting fields of degree less
than n. We want to use the lemma to extend ψ to F1(ζ1), for some root ζ1 of f1.
Then we can use the induction assumption to extend further to E1. However the
lemma requires that f1 be irreducible. So let g1 be an irreducible factor of degree
> 1 of f1, and let g2 be the corresponding factor of f2. Pick a root ζ1 of g1 in E1.
As shown in the lemma we can extend ψ to a homomorphism from F1(ζ1) into
E2, and the number of such homomorphisms is the number of distinct roots of
g2 in E2. As g1 splits in E1, this is at most
deg g2 = deg g1 = [F1(ζ1) : F1] ,
and is equal to [F1(ζ1) : F1] if the roots are distinct.
Let ˜ψ be one such homomorphism. Set ˜F1 = F1(ζ1), and ˜F2 = ˜ψ(F1(ζ1)).
Regard f1 as a polynomial in ˜F1[x]. Then E1 is a splitting field for f1 over ˜F1,
and E2 a splitting field for f2 over ˜F2. As [E1 : ˜F1] < [E1 : F1], the induction
assumption applies. So ˜ψ extends to an isomorphism E1 →E2. Furthermore,
the number of such extensions is at most [E1 : ˜F1], and is equal to [E1 : ˜F1]
if the roots of f1 are distinct. Now we can count the number of extensions of

ψ to E1. There are at most [ ˜F1 : F1] extensions to ˜F1 and for each of these, at
most [E1 : ˜F1] extensions from ˜F1 to E1. So there are at most
[ ˜F1 : F1][E1 : ˜F1] = [E1 : F1]
extensions from F1 to E1. And if the roots of f1 are distinct, then equality holds
everywhere. This completes the induction step. Therefore by the principle of
induction, the theorem is proved.
Corollary 17.6. Let F be a field and f a polynomial with coefficients in F. Suppose that
E1 and E2 are splitting fields for f over F. Then E1 ∼= E2, in fact there is an isomorphism
from E1 to E2 which fixes F.
Proof. Take F1 = F2 = F and ψ = 1F in the theorem. It tells us then that there
exists an isomorphism from E1 to E2 which fixes F.
Corollary 17.7. Suppose E is the splitting field of  a polynomial f ∈F[x]. Then
|Gal(E/F)| ≤[E : F] .
If  the roots of f are distinct, then
|Gal(E/F)| = [E : F] .
Proof. Take F1 = F2 = F, E1 = E2 = E, and ψ = 1F in the theorem. Then
extensions of ψ to E are just automorphisms of E which fix F, in other words,
elements of the Galois group.

CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
These results raise the question: when are the roots of an irreducible polyno-
mial distinct? Exercise 14.20 shows that a polynomial f ∈F[x] has a repeated
factor in F[x] if and only if
(f, f ′) ̸= 1 .
If E/F is a splitting field for f, we can regard f as a polynomial in E[x]. Then
the same criterion tells us whether f has a multiple root. We can apply this to
answer our question.
The answer depends on whether the characteristic of F is positive or not,
because in positive characteristic a polynomial can have derivative 0 without being
constant. So to begin with, assume that f is irreducible and not constant, and
that chr F = 0. Then
deg f ′ < deg f .
But if (f, f ′) ̸= 1, then
(f, f ′) = f ,
since f is irreducible. It follows that f ′ = 0. This implies that f would have to be
constant. So in characteristic 0, an irreducible polynomial cannot have multiple
roots.
If chr F = p, then it can happen that an irreducible polynomial which is not
constant has a multiple root. However, this does not happen if F is finite.
Theorem 17.8. Let F be a finite field. Then an irreducible polynomial f ∈F[x] does
not have repeated roots in its splitting field.
Proof. Suppose that chr F = p, and that f has a multiple root in its splitting field.
Then applying the criterion as before, we see that
f ′ = 0 .
Write out f:
f(x) = anxn + · · · + a1x + a0 ,
for some n > 0, and some a0, a1, . . . , an ∈F. Therefore
0 = f ′(x) = nanxn−1 + · · · + a1 .

17.4. THE GALOIS CORRESPONDENCE
323
So for all j > 0,
jaj = 0 ,
which means that if aj ̸= 0 then j ≡0 (mod p). Thus f is of the form
f(x) = akpxkp + · · · + apxp + a0 .
Now exercise 14.22 tells that since F is finite every element of F is a pth power.
Therefore for every j ≤k, there exists a bjp ∈F such that
ajp = bp
jp .
This gives us
f(x) = bp
kpxkp + · · · + bp
pxp + bp
0 = (bkxk + · · · + bpx + b0)p
(see exercise 14.22). But f is irreducible. So this is impossible. Therefore f does
not have a repeated root.
This discussion is worth summarizing. First we make a definition.
Definition 17.9. A polynomial f ∈F[x] is separable if none of its irreducible
factors has a repeated root.
Theorem 17.10. Let F be a field of  characteristic 0 or a finite field. Then every polynomial
in F[x] is separable.
17.4
The Galois Correspondence
As the examples earlier suggest, if we have a field extension E/F and an inter-
mediate field K, E ⊃K ⊃F, then
Gal(E/K) < Gal(E/F)

324
CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
since an automorphism of E which fixes K, fixes F. On the other hand, if
H < Gal(E/F), then it is easy to see that
Fix(H) := {a ∈E | α(a) = a, for all α ∈H} ,
is a subfield of E containing F. For a subgroup H and an intermediate field K,
there are the obvious relations:
Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
⊃H
Fix
(
Gal(E/K)
)
⊃K .
Example 17.1 Concluded. Let's continue the discussion of example 17.1. We
can compute Fix(H) for the subgroups of Gal(E/Q) in diagram (17.2). First,
we need one more simple remark. Suppose E/F is the splitting field of a sepa-
rable polynomial f ∈F[x], and K is an intermediate field. Then E is also the
splitting field of f regarded as a polynomial over K. Therefore by corollary 17.7,
|Gal(E/K)| = [E : K].
Now let's begin our calculations. Clearly, for H = Gal(E/Q) itself,
Fix(H) = Q. Next, take H = ⟨α2, α3⟩∼= V . We already know that α2 and α3
fix Q(
√
3). So
Fix(H) ⊃Q(
√
3) ,
and
[E : Fix(H)] ≤[E : Q(
√
3)] = 4 .
Therefore by the remark,
|Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
| = [E : Fix(H)] ≤4 .
But
Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
⊃H,
which has order 4. So
4 = |Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
| = [E : Fix(H)] = [E : Q(
√
3)] ,

17.4. THE GALOIS CORRESPONDENCE
325
and
Fix(H) = Q(
√
3) .
We now do the two subgroups of order 2. The automorphism α3 fixes ζ1. We
know that
|⟨α3⟩| = 2 = [E : Q(ζ1)] ,
and applying the argument used for V , we get that
Fix(⟨α3⟩) = Q(ζ1) .
Similarly, α2 fixes ζ2, and
Fix(⟨α2⟩) = Q(ζ2) .
Lastly, for H = {(1)}, Fix(H) = E. So we have recovered diagram 17.1 from
the lattice 17.2.
This discussion can be extended to all the subgroups of Gal(E/Q), since we
know what the subgroups of D4 are. Here is the subgroup lattice of Gal(E/Q)
(see exercise 10.3). Diagram 17.2 is embedded on the right side.

CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS

way as we did for V . The subgroup ⟨α5, α8⟩fixes

Since
[E : Q(

The automorphism α7 fixes

Therefore
Fix(⟨α7⟩) = Q(

For the remaining subgroups of order 2, notice that α5 fixes ζ1 + ζ2, and α8
fixes ζ1 −ζ2. Since
⟨α4⟩= ⟨α2, α3⟩∩⟨α5, α8⟩,
α4 fixes both
√
3 and √−2. Therefore, we have
Fix(⟨α5⟩) = Q(ζ1 + ζ2)
Fix(⟨α8⟩) = Q(ζ1 −ζ2)
Fix(⟨α4⟩) = Q(

In our discussion, we have found that for each subgroup H,
Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
= H .
It is easy to see that for any intermediate field,
Fix
(
Gal(E/K)
)
= K .
These two statements imply that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
subgroups and intermediate fields. This is the Galois correspondence. The key to
proving these results in general is the following theorem.
Theorem 17.11. Let E be a field and G a finite group of  automorphisms of E. Set
F = Fix(G). Then
[E : F] ≤|G| .
Proof. Set m = |G|. What we shall do is to show that any n elements of E are
linearly dependent over F, if n > m. First list the elements of G:
G = {α1 = 1, α2, . . . , αm} .

328
CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
Pick n elements ζ1, . . . , ζn ∈E, and consider the system of m equations in n
unknowns in E:



α1(ζ1)
· · ·
α1(ζn)
...
...
αm(ζ1)
· · ·
αm(ζn)






x1
...
xn


= 0 .
Notice that since α1 = 1, the first equation is just
x1ζ1 + · · · + xnζn = 0 .
What we want is a solution of this equation which lies in F. Now since the
number of unknowns exceeds the number of equations, there exists a non-trivial
solution in E. Pick one with as few non-zero entries as possible, say (ξ1, . . . , ξn).
We can re-order the entries so that ξ1 ̸= 0. Since the system is linear,
ξ−1
1 (ξ1, . . . , ξn)
is also a solution, with the minimal number of non-zero entries. So we can assume
that ξ1 = 1. The system then looks like this:





α1(ζ1)
· · ·
α1(ζn)
α2(ζ1)
· · ·
α2(ζn)
...
...

· · ·
αm(ζn)










1
ξ2
...
ξn




= 0 .
What we want to do, is to show that this solution lies in F, in other words that it
is invariant under G.
Suppose it is not. Then one of the non-zero entries is not invariant, say ξ2.
This means that there exists an element αj ∈G such that
αj(ξ2) ̸= ξ2 .
Apply αj to the system:





αjα1(ζ1)
· · ·
αjα1(ζn)
αjα2(ζ1)
· · ·
αjα2(ζn)
...
...
αjαm(ζ1)
· · ·
αjαm(ζn)










1
αj(ξ2)
...
αj(ξn)




= 0 .

17.4. THE GALOIS CORRESPONDENCE
329
Since G is a group,
{αjα1, αjα2, . . . , αjαm} = {α1, α2, . . . , αm} .
So this system is just the original one with the equations permuted. Therefore
(1, αj(ξ2), . . . , αj(ξn)) is also a solution of our system. It follows that
(
1, αj(ξ2), . . . , αj(ξn)
)
−
(
1, ξ2, . . . , ξn
)
=
(
0, αj(ξ2) −ξ2, . . . , αj(ξn) −ξn
)
is a solution. It is non-trivial since the second entry is not 0. But it has one
less non-zero entry than the original solution. This is impossible. Therefore the
original solution is invariant under G. In other words, {ζ1, . . . , ζn} is linearly
dependent over F. This proves that
[E : F] ≤|G| .
We can now prove the fundamental theorem about the Galois correspon-
dence. It will allow us to translate questions about polynomials and their roots
into questions about their Galois groups.
Theorem 17.12 (Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory). Let E/F be the split-
ting field of  a separable polynomial in F[x]. Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between
subgroups of Gal(E/F) and intermediate fields between E and F given by
H ↔Fix(H)
and
Gal(E/K) ↔K ,
where H is a subgroup and K an intermediate field, such that
Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
= H
and
Fix
(
Gal(E/K)
)
= K .
Proof. Suppose that E/F is the splitting field of f ∈F[x], which is separable.
First we show that
Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
= H ,

330
CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
for any subgroup H. Now by corollary 17.7
|Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
| = [E : Fix(H)] ,
since E is the splitting field for f over Fix(H). And by theorem 17.11, we know
that
[E : Fix(H)] ≤|H| .
Therefore
|Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
| ≤|H| .
On the other hand, as we remarked earlier,
Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
⊃H ,
so that
|Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
| ≥|H| .
Hence |Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
| = |H| , and
Gal
(
E/ Fix(H)
)
= H .
Next we prove that
Fix
(
Gal(E/K)
)
= K .
Set H := Gal(E/K), and K′ := Fix(H) ⊃K. We have just shown that
Gal(E/K′) = H = Gal(E/K) .
Again, since E is the splitting field for f regarded as a polynomial over K or K′,
[E : K] = |Gal(E/K)| = |Gal(E/K′)| = [E : K′] .
But since K′ ⊃K,
[E : K] = [E : K′][K′ : K] ,
and therefore [K′ : K] = 1 and
Fix
(
Gal(E/K)
)
= K′ = K .

17.4. THE GALOIS CORRESPONDENCE

Corollary 17.13. Fix
(
Gal(E/F)
)
= F.
Corollary 17.14. Let H be a subgroup of G =: Gal(E/F), and let K = Fix(H).
Then
[K : F] = [G : H] .
Proof. By the theorem we have
H = Gal(E/K) ,
and by corollary 17.7
[E : K] = |Gal(E/K)| .
Therefore
[K : F] = [E : F]
/
[E : K] = |Gal(E/F)|
/
|Gal(E/K)| = [G : H] .
Here is a diagram with the degrees of the extensions:

Example 17.15. Let E be the splitting field of xp −2, p prime, as in example
16.10. So E = Q(
p√
2, ω), where ω is a primitive pth root of 1. Again, an
automorphism α of E is determined by α(
p√
2) and α(ω). Now α(
p√
2) must
be another pth root of 2 by 17.2. These are
p√
2 ωj, where 0 ≤j < p. And

332
CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
α(ω) must be a primitive pth root of 1. So the automorphisms of E are αi,j,
1 ≤i < p, 0 ≤j < p, where
αi,j(ω) = ωi
and
αi,j(
p√
2) =
p√
2 ωj .
To see what the group structure is, let's compute αi,j αk,l :
αi,j
(
αk,l(ω)
)
= αi,j(ωk) = ωik
αi,j
(
αk,l(
p√
2 ω)
)
= αi,j
( p√
2 ωl)
=
p√
2 ωjωil =
p√
2 ωj+il .
Therefore
αi,jαk,l = αik,j+il .
But this is just the group Fp(p−1) as discussed in exercise 8.23 . So
Gal(E/Q) ∼= Fp(p−1) .
It has the two interesting subgroups
T := {α1,j | 0 ≤j < p} ∼= Fp
and
K := {αi,0 | 1 ≤j < p} ∼= F×
p .
Here is the lattice:

17.4. THE GALOIS CORRESPONDENCE

What are the corresponding intermediate fields between E and Q? Well T
fixes Q(ω) since
α1,j(ω) = ω ,
for all j. And since
αi,0(
p√
2) =
p√
2 ,
for all i, K fixes Q(
p√
2). So by the fundamental theorem (or a direct calculation),
Gal
(
E/Q(ω)
) ∼= T
and
Gal
(
E/Q(
p√

) ∼= K .
The diagram of field extensions is

We can also compute the Galois groups Gal(Fpr/Fp):
Theorem 17.16. The groups Gal(Fpr/Fp) are cyclic of  order r, generated by the Frobenius
homomorphism.
Proof. Let
ψ : Fpr →Fpr ,
given by
ψ(a) = ap ,

334
CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
be the Frobenius homomorphism. As was shown in exercise 14.22, it is an au-
tomorphism of Fpr, and it does fix Fp (see exercise 14.10). So ψ belongs to
Gal(Fpr/Fp). Now
ψs(a) = aps .
Suppose that s | r. We saw on page 301 that Fps is the splitting field of xps −x
over Fp . This means that aps = a for all a ∈Fps, but for a ̸∈Fps, aps ̸= a. In
other words,
Fix⟨ψs⟩= Fps .
In particular for s = r, we have
|ψ| = r .
But
|Gal(Fpr/Fp)| = [Fpr : Fp] = r .
Therefore
Gal(Fpr/Fp) = ⟨ψ⟩.

The Galois correspondence reflects further properties of the structure of the

Theorem 17.17.
(i) Let K/F be the splitting field of  a separable polynomial in F[x],
and let E/K be a field extension. Then Gal(E/K) is a normal subgroup of
Gal(E/F). (This holds in particular if E/F is also the splitting field of  a sepa-
rable polynomial.)
(ii) Let E/F be the splitting field of  a separable polynomial in F[x], and set G =
Gal(E/F) . Suppose that H is a normal subgroup of G, and set K = Fix(H).
Then
Gal(K/F) ∼= G/H .
..E

.F

Proof.
(i) Suppose that K is the splitting field of f ∈F[x]. Take α ∈
Gal(E/F). By 17.2, α permutes the roots of f. Therefore, for any root ζ
of f, α(ζ) ∈K. Since every element of K is a rational expression in the
roots of f, it follows that α(K) ⊂K.
Now let β ∈Gal(E/K) and ζ ∈K. Then α−1(ζ) ∈K. So β
(
α−1(ζ)
)
=
α−1(ζ). Therefore
(αβα−1)(ζ) = α
(
α−1(ζ)
)
= ζ .
Thus, αβα−1 ∈Gal(E/K), and Gal(E/K) is a normal subgroup of
Gal(E/F).

336
CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
(ii) We first show that any α ∈G maps K = Fix(H) into itself. Take ζ ∈K
and β ∈H. Then since H is normal,
βα = αβ′ ,
for some β′ ∈H, and
β
(
α(ζ)
)
= α
(
β′(ζ)
)
= α(ζ) .
Therefore α(ζ) ∈K. Now we can define a homomorphism res : G →
Gal(K/F) by setting
res(α) = α|K ,
for α ∈G. Since H = Gal(E/K), H = ker(res).
It remains to show that res is surjective. This means that any β ∈Gal(K/F)
should extend to an automorphism of E. Since E is the splitting field of
a polynomial in F[x], it is the splitting field of the same polynomial re-
garded as an element of K[x]. Therefore by theorem 17.4, β extends to
an automorphism of E, and res is surjective.

17.5. DISCRIMINANTS
337
In example 17.1, all the subgroups of D4 of order 4 are normal. For example
take H = ⟨α2, α3⟩. We calculated that Fix(H) = Q(
√
3). Now
α5(ζ2
1) = ζ2
2 .
Since
ζ2
1 = 1 +
√
3
,
ζ2
2 = 1 −
√
3 ,
it follows that
α5(
√
3) = −
√
3 .
Thus α5 restricted to Q(
√
3) generates Gal
(
Q(
√
3)/Q
)
. And
⟨α5⟩∼= Gal(E/Q)
/
H .
Instead of α5, we could have just as well used α6 or α7 or α8. The calculations
for the other two groups of order 4 are similar.
There is only one normal subgroup of order 2:
⟨α4⟩= Z
(
Gal(E/Q)
)
.
We computed that Fix(⟨α4⟩) = Q(
√
3, √−2). Now
α5 :

So α5 and α2 restricted to Q(

3, √−2) generate its automorphism group. And
indeed,
⟨α5, α2⟩∼= Gal(E/Q)
/
⟨α4⟩.
17.5
Discriminants
In chapter 15, the discriminant of a polynomial was introduced. In this section
we discuss its connection with Galois theory.

338
CHAPTER 17. GALOIS GROUPS
Let F be a field, f ∈F[x] a separable polynomial of degree n, and E/F the
splitting field of f. Denote by ζ1, . . . , ζn , the roots of f in E. Then
∆:=
∏
i<j
(ζi −ζj)2 ∈E
is the discriminant of f. As we saw, it is invariant under all permutations of the
roots. In particular, it is fixed by Gal(f) ⊂Sn. Therefore by corollary 17.13,
∆∈F .
Now set
δ =
∏
i<j
(ζi −ζj) ∈E .
So ∆= δ2. From exercise 15.11, we see that
α(δ) = (sgn α)δ ,
for α ∈Sn. This means that δ is fixed by all even permutations, but not nec-
essarily by all elements in Gal(f). It is the invariant which determines whether
Gal(f) ⊂An or not.
Theorem 17.18. Suppose that f is a separable polynomial of  degree n in F[x]. Then
δ ∈F if  and only if Gal(f) ⊂An.
Proof. Suppose that δ ∈F, and that α ∈Gal(f), but α ̸∈An. Then α is an odd
permutation of the roots and
α(δ) = −δ .
This is impossible since δ ̸= 0. So Gal(f) ⊂An.
Conversely, if Gal(f) ⊂An then as we saw above, δ is fixed by Gal(f). So
δ ∈F by corollary 17.13.
For example, if
f(x) = x3 −x2 −2x + 1 ∈Q[x] ,

17.6. EXERCISES
339
then it is easy to check that f has no root in Q and is therefore irreducible. Its
discriminant is 49. So the Galois group of f is A3. In the next chapter we will
use δ in our analysis of quartics via Galois theory.

Quartics
18.1
Galois Groups of  Quartics
In this chapter we look at what Galois theory says about quartic equations. First
let's recall what we know about cubics. According to exercise 17.8 the Galois
group of an irreducible polynomial acts transitively on its roots. The only transi-
tive subgroups of S3 are A3 and S3 itself. So these are the only possible Galois
groups if the cubic f is irreducible. (What if f is reducible?) Furthermore, its
Galois group is A3 if and only if the discriminant ∆is a square in F.
If
f(x) = x3 + a2x2 + a1x + a0 ,
a2, a1, a0 ∈F ,
and chr F ̸= 3, then we saw in exercise 16.10 and 16.11 that the substitution
x = y −a2/3 transforms f into a cubic of the form
g(y) = y3 + b1 y + b0 ,
where
b1 = a1 −a2

b0 = a0 −a1a2

+ 2a3

and the discriminant is
∆= −4b3

In terms of a2, a1, a0, we have
∆= −27a2

CHAPTER 18. QUARTICS
Now suppose that f ∈F[x] is an irreducible quartic with distinct roots
ζ1, ζ2, ζ3, ζ4 in its splitting field E. Then Gal(f), which we will denote by G, can
be identified with a subgroup of S4, the group of permutations of the roots. We
saw in exercise 8.17 that the transitive subgroups of S4 are
(i) S4
(ii) A4
(iii) D4 = {(1 2 3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4 3 2), (1), (2 4), (1 3), (1 2)(3 4),
(1 4)(2 3)} and its 3 conjugates
(iv) V = {(1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3), (1)}
(v) C4 := {(1 2 3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4 3 2), (1)} and its 3 conjugates
So these are the possibilities for the Galois group of f. We need invariants which
will help us decide which one of these it is.
Recall that a composition series for S4 is given by
S4 ◃A4 ◃V ◃Z/2Z ◃{1}
(
see (12.1)
)
. We know that δ or ∆will tell us whether G is a subgroup of A4.
So it is natural to look for an invariant associated with V next.
Let ζ1, ζ2, ζ3, ζ4 ∈E be the 4 roots of f and set
η1 = (ζ1 + ζ2)(ζ3 + ζ4)
η2 = (ζ1 + ζ3)(ζ2 + ζ4)
η3 = (ζ1 + ζ4)(ζ2 + ζ3) .
It is easy to see that
(i) η1, η2, and η3 are all invariant under V ;
(ii) no element of S4 outside V fixes these 3 quantities ;

18.1. GALOIS GROUPS OF QUARTICS
345
(iii) S4 permutes η1, η2, and η3 .
To verify (ii) you need only check what a 2-cycle, 3-cycle and 4-cycle do. To verify
(iii) it's enough to note that (1 2) and (1 2 3 4) permute η1, η2, and η3 . Now let
r(x) = (x −η1)(x −η2)(x −η3) .
Then since the coefficients of r are symmetric in η1, η2, and η3, they are sym-
metric in ζ1, ζ2, ζ3, ζ4. Therefore they must be invariant under G. This means
that they lie in F by corollary 17.13. The polynomial r ∈F[x] is called the cubic
resolvent of f. The splitting field of r is
K := F(η1, η2, η3) .
So K ⊂Fix
(
V ∩G
)
. Since no element of S4 outside V fixes these 3 elements,
we know that
Gal(E/K) = V ∩G ,
and therefore
K = Fix
(
V ∩G
)
.
..E
.K
.F
.G ∩V
.G/G ∩V
As V is a normal subgroup of S4, V ∩G is normal in G. So by theorem
17.17,
G/
(
V ∩G
) ∼= Gal(K/F) .
(18.2)

346
CHAPTER 18. QUARTICS
Also notice that the discriminant of r is the same as the discriminant of f.
We have namely,
η1 −η2 = ζ1ζ3 + ζ2ζ4 −ζ1ζ2 −ζ3ζ4 = −(ζ1 −ζ4)(ζ2 −ζ3)
Similarly,
η2 −η3 = −(ζ1 −ζ2)(ζ3 −ζ4)
η1 −η3 = −(ζ1 −ζ3)(ζ2 −ζ4) .
Therefore
δ =
∏
i<j
(ζi −ζj) = −
∏
i<j
(ηi −ηj) .
and the discriminants of f and r are the same.
Let's use what we know about cubics to analyze quartics. Suppose first that
r is irreducible. Then there are two possibilities: either δ ∈F and [K : F] = 3
or δ ̸∈F and [K : F] = 6. In the first case,
3 | [E : F] = |G|
and G ⊂A4. Looking at the list of transitive subgroups of S4, we see that we
must have G = A4. Similarly, in the second case,
6 | [E : F] = |G|
and G ̸⊂A4. Therefore G = S4.
Next, suppose that r is reducible. The first possibility is that r splits into
linear factors in F, in other words, η1, η2, η3 ∈F and K = F. By (18.2), this
is equivalent to saying that that G ⊂V . The only transitive subgroup of V is V
itself. So G = V .
The second possibility is that r splits in F into an irreducible quadratic and
a linear factor. So δ ̸∈F and [K : F] = 2. Since [E : F] ̸= 2, [E : K] ̸= 1 and
|G ∩V | = 2 or 4 .

18.2. THE GEOMETRY OF THE CUBIC RESOLVENT
347
In the first case, [E : F] = 4 and G ∼= C4. In the second case, [E : F] = 8 and
Gal(f) ∼= D4. Summarizing,

In practice you compute the discriminant of f and then check whether it has
a square root in F. So we just need a formula for the discriminant of f. Since
this is the same as the discriminant of r, we can use our formula (18.1) for the
discriminant of a cubic, if we know what the coefficients of r are. By applying
a Tschirnhausen transformation to f (see exercise 16.10) we can arrange that it
has the form
f(x) = x4 + b2x2 + b1x + b0 .
Then by exercise 15.6
r(x) = x3 −2b2x2 + (b2
2 −4b0)x + b2
1 .
With software to do the calculations for you, it is easy to decide what the Galois
group of a quartic is, apart from the ambiguity in the last case in the table.
18.2
The Geometry of  the Cubic Resolvent
This section requires some understanding of  the geometry of  conics in C2.
Suppose we are given a quartic
f(x) = x4 + b2x2 + b1x + b0 ,

348
CHAPTER 18. QUARTICS
with b2, b1, b0 ∈C. Let's introduce a new variable
y := x2 .
Substituting into the quartic gives us a quadratic polynomial in 2 variables,
q0(x, y) := y2 + b2y + b1x + b0 .
If we set
q1(x, y) := x2 −y ,
then solving f = 0 is equivalent to solving the pair of equations
q0
= 0
q1
= 0
simultaneously. We can interpret this geometrically. Each of these equations
defines a conic in C2. They intersect in 4 points. If ζ1, ζ2, ζ3, ζ4 ∈C are the
roots of f, then the points of intersection are
Q1
= (ζ1, ζ2
1) ,
Q2
= (ζ2, ζ2
2) ,
Q3
= (ζ3, ζ2
3) ,
Q4
= (ζ4, ζ2
4) .
The two conics determine a pencil of conics, given by
qt := q0 + tq1 = 0 ,
t ∈C ,
which all pass through the 4 points Q1 , Q2 , Q3 , Q4 , the basis points of the
pencil.
To any quadratic in two variables one can associate a symmetric 3×3 matrix.
If
q(x, y) = ax2 + 2bxy + 2cx + dy2 + 2ey + f ,
set
Aq =


a
b
c
b
d
e

f

.

18.2. THE GEOMETRY OF THE CUBIC RESOLVENT
349
Then det Aq = 0 if and only if q is degenerate, that is, splits into a product of
linear factors. Equivalently, the conic q = 0 is a pair of lines.
For what values of t is our pencil of conics degenerate? Well,
det Aqt

t

=
(

2 + 4b0)t −b2

)
/4
=
−r(t)/4 .
So the pencil degenerates when t = ηi, i = 1, 2, 3. Each of these degenerate
conics is a pair of lines passing through the 4 points Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. It is not
hard to identify exactly which lines belong to each degenerate value.
The line through Q1 and Q2 is given by
y −ζ2
1
x −ζ1
= ζ2
2 −ζ2
1
ζ2 −ζ1
= ζ1 + ζ2 ,
or equivalently, by
l12(x, y) := y −(ζ1 + ζ2)x + ζ1ζ2 = 0 .
Similarly, the line through Q3 and Q4 has equation
l34(x, y) := y −(ζ3 + ζ4)x + ζ3ζ4 = 0 .
The product of the two linear forms l12 and l34 is the degenerate quadratic form
l12l34(x, y)
=
(
y −(ζ1 + ζ2)x + ζ1ζ2
)(
y −(ζ3 + ζ4)x + ζ3ζ4

This picture of the pencil of conics was drawn by a package called 'Quartics'. It
also can compute the Galois group of a quartic. First you must load the package:
In[1]:= << Quartics.m;
A function CubicResolvent is defined which computes the cubic resolvent of
a quartic, and then applies the criteria in the table above to determine the Galois
group (though it cannot distinguish between D4 and C4). For example, let
In[2]:= f = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1

So the Galois Group is V4.

The General Equation of the nth
Degree
19.1
Examples
Suppose that f ∈F[x] is an irreducible polynomial of degree n with distinct
roots in its splitting field. If f is a 'generic' polynomial, or one chosen at random,
then we would not expect there to be any algebraic relations among its roots,
apart from those given by the elementary symmetric polynomials. So the group
of symmetries of the roots should be the full permutation group of degree n. In
exercise 18.10, you saw that the Galois group of an irreducible quartic, chosen
at random, always seems to be S4. In fact you probably noticed that it is hard to
come up with a quartic whose Galois group is not S4. If you had a suitable test
you would find the same for n > 4. In this chapter we want to give a family of
examples of degree p, p prime, with Galois group Sp, and prove that indeed the
general polynomial of degree n has Galois group Sn. We shall also give a proof
of the fundamental theorem of algebra using Galois theory.
Theorem 19.1. Let f ∈Q[x] be irreducible of  degree p. Suppose that f has precisely 2
non-real roots. Then Gal(f) ∼= Sp.
Proof. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, f splits in C. So we can assume
that the splitting field of f, E ⊂C. Let ζ1, . . . , ζp be the roots of f in E.
Suppose that ζ1 and ζ2 are the two non-real roots. Since the coefficients of f are
real, complex conjugation permutes its roots, and therefore defines an element of
355

356
CHAPTER 19. THE GENERAL EQUATION OF THE NTH DEGREE
Gal(f) (see exercise 17.2). It fixes all the real roots and interchanges the two non-
real roots. Thus conjugation corresponds to the transposition (1 2) ∈Gal(f).
Now Q(ζ1) ⊂E, so that
[Q(ζ1) : Q]
 [E : Q] = |Gal(f)| .
But
[Q(ζ1) : Q] = deg f = p .
Therefore
p
 |Gal(f)| .
It follows then from the first Sylow theorem (see exercise 11.9) there is an element
of order p in Gal(f). But by exercise 6.10, a transposition and an element of order
p generate Sp. Therefore Gal(f) ∼= Sp.
Instead of using the first Sylow theorem you can also use exercise 8.18 since
Gal(f) is transitive by exercise 17.8.
Examples 19.2.
(i) A cubic with ∆< 0 has only one real root (see exercise
16.12) and therefore has Galois group S3.
(ii) Let
f(x) = x5 −6x + 2 ∈Q[x] .
By the Eisenstein criterion (theorem 14.13), f is irreducible. And
f ′(x) = 5x4 −6 ,
which has exactly 2 real roots. Thus f has at most 3 real roots. Checking
a few values of f shows that it does in fact have 3 real roots, and therefore
2 non-real roots. So
Gal(f) ∼= S5 .
Remark 19.3. Suppose that f is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, and
suppose that the reduction of f modulo a prime p, ¯f ∈Fp[x], is a product of

19.2. SYMMETRIC FUNCTIONS
357
irreducible factors of degrees n1, . . . , nl. Then Gal(f) contains an permutation
of cycle type (n1, . . . , nl) (see [11], §4.16, and cf. exercise 17.9). This can often
help to determine the Galois group of a polynomial over Q. Here is a simple
example.
Example 19.4. Let f(x) = x4+2x3+x+3 ∈Q[x]. Modulo 2, ¯f is irreducible.
Therefore Gal(f) contains a 4-cycle. Modulo 3, ¯f factors as
¯f(x) = x(x3 + 2x + 1) .
So Gal(f) contains a 3-cycle. Hence
Gal(f) ∼= S4 .
19.2
Symmetric Functions
In this section, we are going to prove that in a sense, if there are no non-trivial
algebraic relations among the roots of a polynomial, then its Galois group is
indeed Sn.
Set M := F(x1, . . . , xn), the field of rational functions in the variables
x1, . . . , xn, and let
f(x) := (x −x1) · · · (x −xn) ∈M[x] .
Then
f(x) = xn −s1xn−1 + · · · + (−1)nsn ,
so that its coefficients actually lie in F(s1, . . . , sn) ⊂M. Clearly there are no
algebraic relations among the roots of f except those given by the elementary
symmetric polynomials. Furthermore, f is separable and M is the splitting field
of f over F(s1, . . . , sn). Now the full symmetric group acts on M: for α ∈Sn
and g ∈M,
(αg)(x1, . . . , xn) := g(xα(1), . . . , xα(n)) .

358
CHAPTER 19. THE GENERAL EQUATION OF THE NTH DEGREE
And L := Fix(Sn) is the field of symmetric functions, which contains F(s1, . . . , sn).
So we have the diagram
..M
.L
.F(s1, . . . , sn)
But then corollary 17.13 tells us that
L = Fix(Sn) ⊂Fix
(
Gal
(
M/F(s1, . . . , sn)
))
= F(s1, . . . , sn) .
Therefore
L = F(s1, . . . , sn) ,
in other word, F(s1, . . . , sn) is the field of symmetric functions. Furthermore,
Gal(f) = Sn .
As we saw in corollary 15.4, s1, . . . , sn are algebraically independent. Tradition-
ally an equation like
f = 0
where the coefficients are algebraically independent, is called a general equation
of the nth degree.
Remark 19.5.
(i) As in exercise 15.11, let
δ(x1, . . . , xn) =
∏
i<j
(xi −xj) .
Then L(δ) ⊂M is invariant under An, and in fact,
Gal
(
M/L(δ)
)
= An .

19.3. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA

(ii) Suppose n = 4. Set
y1 = (x1 + x2)(x3 + x4)
y2 = (x1 + x3)(x2 + x4)
y3 = (x1 + x4)(x2 + x3) ,
Then it is not hard to see that
Gal
(
M/L(y1, y2, y3)
)
= V .
So we have the chain of field extensions with the corresponding subgroups
of S4:

The Fundamental Theorem of  Algebra
There are many proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra, some algebraic,
some analytic, and some topological. In this section we shall give a proof which
uses Galois theory.
Theorem 19.6. Any polynomial f ∈C[x] splits in C.

360
CHAPTER 19. THE GENERAL EQUATION OF THE NTH DEGREE
Proof. First of all, notice that we can assume that f has real coefficients. If not,
then consider f ¯f ∈R[x]. If ζ ∈C is a root of f ¯f, then it must be a root of f or
of ¯f. In the latter case, ¯ζ is a root of f. So if f ¯f splits in C, then f does as well.
Thus we can always replace f by f ¯f. We can also assume that deg f > 1.
Now let E be the splitting field of f over R. By exercise 16.9, [E : R] is even.
So Gal(f) has a non-trivial Sylow 2-subgroup, H1. Let K1 = Fix(H1). Then
[K1 : R] is odd. Therefore by exercise 16.9 again, K1 = R and Gal(f) = H1.
In other words, Gal(f) is a 2-group.
..E
.K1
.R
.H1
As we saw in exercise 11.8, a 2-group has a subgroup of index 2. So let H2
be of index 2 in Gal(f). The intermediate field K2 = Fix(H2) is a quadratic
extension of R. But according to exercise 16.1 the only quadratic extension of R
is C. Therefore K2 = C.

Suppose that |Gal(f)| > 2. Then H2 is a 2-group, and it too has a subgroup
H3 of index 2. So K3 = Fix(H3) is a quadratic extension of C. But there are no
quadratic extensions of C. Therefore |Gal(f)| = 2 and E = C. In other words,
f splits in C.

Solution by Radicals
In the 16th century, formulas which express the solutions of a cubic equation and
a quartic equation in terms of radicals were discovered. For two hundred years,
mathematicians wondered whether the same could be done for quintics. Around
1800 it was shown that this is impossible. In this chapter, we shall first see how
to write the solutions of a cubic in terms of radicals. Then we shall prove that for
an equation of degree 5 or greater, no such formulas exist in general. All fields
are assumed to be of characteristic 0.
20.1
Formulas for a Cubic
There are several ways to derive the formulas for the roots of a cubic. We shall
use Lagrange resolvents because they will come up again when we discuss equations
with cyclic Galois groups.
Suppose F is a field and f ∈F[x] an irreducible cubic. According to exercise
16.10, we can assume that it is of the form
f(x) = x3 + a1x + a0 .
If a1 = 0, then the roots are just the cube roots of −a0. So we will also assume
that a1 ̸= 0. We saw in Chapter 16, p.295, that the splitting field E of f is of
degree 3 over F(δ). We would like to express the roots of f in terms of the cube
roots of an element of F(δ). A Lagrange resolvent does this, at least up to a cube
root of unity.

and let ζ1, ζ2 and ζ3 be the roots of f. Then the Lagrange resolvents are
ξ1 := ζ1 + ζ2 + ζ3 = 0
ξ2 := ζ1 + ωζ2 + ω2ζ3
(20.1)
ξ3 := ζ1 + ω2ζ2 + ωζ3 .
Then

By exchanging ω for ω2, we get a similar expression for ξ3

20.1. FORMULAS FOR A CUBIC
365
The first three terms above are symmetric in ζ1, ζ2 and ζ3. We can therefore
express them in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, whose values
are −a2 = 0, a1 and −a0 :
∑
j
ζ3
j = −a3
2 + 3a1a2 −3a0 = −3a0
∑
j̸=k

=
3a0 .
Substituting into (20.2) gives
ξ3
2 = −27
2 a0 + 3
2
√
−3 δ .
Similarly,
ξ3
3 = −27
2 a0 −3
2
√
−3 δ .
So we can take cube roots of the right-hand sides of these two equations to obtain
ξ2 and ξ3.
ξ2 =

2 a0 + 3
2
√
−3 δ
(20.3)
ξ3 =
3√

There are three choices for each cube root. But we must keep in mind that
ξ2ξ3 = (ζ2
1 + ζ2
2 + ζ2
3) + (ω + ω2)(ζ1ζ2 + ζ2ζ3 + ζ1ζ3)
= (ζ2
1 + ζ2
2 + ζ2
3) −(ζ1ζ2 + ζ2ζ3 + ζ1ζ3)
= −3a1 ,
which we have assumed not to be 0. So each value of ξ2 determines a value of ξ3.
Lastly, we can recover the roots of f by inverting the system of linear equations

3(ξ2 + ξ3)
ζ2 = 1
3(ω2ξ2 + ωξ3)
(20.4)
ζ3 = 1
3(ωξ2 + ω2ξ3) .
Choosing a different cube root in (20.3) means multiplying ξ2 by ω (or ω2) and
ξ3 by ω2 (or ω). This does not change {ζ1, ζ2, ζ3}. These are Cardano's formulas
for the roots of a cubic. Notice that if ω ∈F, then
E = F(δ, ξ2) = F(δ, ξ3) .
As was pointed out in exercise 17.7,
Gal
(
E/F(δ)
) ∼= A3 ,
which is cyclic of order 3.
Example 20.1. Take f(x) = x3 + x −2. Then by exercise 16.11, δ = 4√−7,
which gives
ξ3
2 = 27 + 6
√
21
and
ξ3
3 = 27 −6
√
21 .
Taking the real cube roots, we have
ξ2 =
3√
27 + 6
√
21
and
ξ3 =
3√
27 −6
√
21 .
Formulas (20.4) then give us the roots of f:

But obviously 1 is a root of f, and since
x3 + x −2 = (x −1)(x2 + x + 2) ,

20.2. CYCLIC EXTENSIONS
367
the other two roots are just
−1

.
This makes it clear that Cardano's formulas can easily produce expressions for
the roots which are rather obscure.
20.2
Cyclic Extensions
In example 17.15 we calculated the Galois group of xp −2 over Q. The result is
that after adjoining the pth roots of 1 to Q, the Galois group is cyclic of order p.
This is typical.
Theorem 20.2. Let F be a field of  characteristic 0 and let f(x) = xn −a ∈F[x].
Suppose that F contains the nth roots of 1. Then Gal(f) is cyclic and its order divides n.
Proof. Let E = F[x]/(xn −a). If ζ ∈E is a root of f, then so is ωζ, if ω ∈F
is an nth root of 1. Thus E is the splitting field of f over F.
If α ∈Gal(E/F), then α is determined by α(ζ). Furthermore, α(ζ) must be
of the form ωζ for some nth root of 1, ω. Therefore let us define αω ∈Gal(f)
by
αω(ζ) = ωζ ,
where ω is an nth root of 1. This defines a mapping
µn →Gal(f) ,
(see example 6.8(iii)), which we already know is surjective. It is a homomorphism:
suppose that ω1 and ω2 are nth roots of 1. Then
αω1ω2(ζ) = (ω1ω2)ζ = αω1
(
αω2(ζ)
)
.
So
αω1ω2 = αω1αω2 .
Therefore Gal(f) is a quotient of a cyclic group of order n. So it too is cyclic,
and its order divides n.

368
CHAPTER 20. SOLUTION BY RADICALS
An extension E/F, where E is the splitting field of a separable polynomial
in F[x], is called cyclic if Gal(E/F) is cyclic. If E/F is the splitting field of an
irreducible cubic as in the previous section, then E/F(δ) is a cyclic extension.
We showed there that E = F(δ, ξ2) with ξ3
2 ∈F(δ). In general if E/F is cyclic,
then E = F( n√a) for some a ∈F. This can be proved as above by finding a
Lagrange resolvent ξ with ξn ∈F and E = F(ξ).
Definition 20.3. Suppose that E/F is a cyclic extension, and α is a generator
of its Galois group. Assume that F contains n distinct nth roots of 1. Then for
ζ ∈E and ω ∈F, an nth root of 1, we define the Lagrange resolvent
(ω, ζ) := ζ + ωα(ζ) + · · · + ωn−1αn−1(ζ) .
(20.5)
Equations (20.1) give Lagrange resolvents for n = 3.
Theorem 20.4. Let F be a field of  characteristic prime to n, containing the nth roots of 1.
Suppose that E/F is a cyclic extension. Then
E = F(
n√a) ,
for some a ∈F.
Proof. Let ω be a primitive nth root of 1. First notice that
α
(
(ω, ζ)
)
= α(ζ) + ωα2(ζ) + · · · + ωn−1ζ
= ω−1(ω, ζ) .
This implies that if (ω, ζ) ̸= 0 and 1 ≤i < n then
α
(
(ω, ζ)i)
= ω−i(ω, ζ)i ̸= (ω, ζ)i ,
and therefore
(ω, ζ)i ̸∈F .
However,
α
(
(ω, ζ)n)
= (ω, ζ)n ,

20.2. CYCLIC EXTENSIONS
369
so that
(ω, ζ)n ∈F .
Thus if (ω, ζ) ̸= 0,
E = F
(
(ω, ζ)
)
,
and we can take
a = (ω, ζ)n .
It remains to show that ζ can be found with (ω, ζ) ̸= 0.
Now for each i, 0 ≤i < n, we can replace ω by ωi in (20.5). This gives us a
system of n equations:


CHAPTER 20. SOLUTION BY RADICALS
20.3
Solution by Radicals in Higher Degrees
The formulas (20.3) and (20.4) express the solutions of the cubic in terms of the
square roots of ∆∈F and the cube roots of −(27/2)a0 + (3/2)√−3
√
∆∈
F(
√
∆) . Can one find similar formulas for equations of higher degree? In other
words, can one build up an expression for the solutions by starting with an mth
root of an element a ∈F, then taking an nth root of an element b ∈F(
m√a),
and so on? In terms of the splitting field of the equation, this means that it should
be built up as a sequence of 'radical' extensions:
..E

Example 20.5. Let f(x) = x6 −4x3 + 1 ∈Q[x]. First note that g(y) =

As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, this can be done in general for
quartics, but not for equations of degree greater than 4. More precisely, we shall
prove that for the general equation of degree greater than 4, that is one whose
Galois group is Sn, no such formulas can exist. In fact, it can be shown that if
such formulas do exist for a specific equation of degree p, where p ≥5 is prime,
then its Galois group must be a subgroup of the Frobenius group F(p−1)p. Since
the Frobenius group is a rather small subgroup of Sp, this result suggests that
the general equation of degree 5, say, is very far from being solvable by radicals.
First we need to know that we can assume that the base field F contains all
the roots of unity that we need.
Lemma 20.6. Suppose f ∈F[x] and let E be the splitting field of f. Let ω be a primitive
mth root of 1. Then
Gal
(
E(ω)/F(ω)
) ∼= Gal
(
E/E ∩F(ω)
)
and
Gal
(
E/E ∩F(ω)
)
▹Gal(E/F) .
Proof. Here is a picture of the field extensions:

.F
Since E/F is the splitting field of f we have a surjective homomorphism
res : Gal
(
E(ω)/F
)
→Gal(E/F)
by theorem 17.17. It is defined by restricting an element of Gal
(
E(ω)/F
)
to E,
and thus its kernel consists of automorphisms whose restriction to E is trivial.
Now Gal
(
E(ω)/F(ω)
)
⊂Gal
(
E(ω)/F
)
and the composed mapping
Gal
(
E(ω)/F(ω)
)
↩→Gal
(
E(ω)/F
)
→Gal(E/F) ,
is injective: an automorphism of E(ω) which is trivial on F(ω) and on E, is
trivial. Furthermore, the image H lies in Gal
(
E/E ∩F(ω)
)
. We want to see
that it is all of Gal
(
E/E ∩F(ω)
)
. Suppose ζ ∈E is fixed by H. If we regard
ζ as an element of E(ω) this means that it is fixed by Gal
(
E(ω)/F(ω)
)
, and
therefore lies in F(ω). So ζ ∈E ∩F(ω) and
Fix H = E ∩F(ω) .
It follows that
H = Gal
(
E/E ∩F(ω)
)
.
To see that it is a normal subgroup of Gal(E/F), take β ∈Gal
(
E/E ∩
F(ω)
)
and α ∈Gal(E/F). Choose β′ ∈Gal
(
E(ω)/F(ω)
)
and

20.3. SOLUTION BY RADICALS IN HIGHER DEGREES
373
α′ ∈Gal(E(ω)/F) such that
res(α′) = α
and
res(β′) = β .
Then
α′β′α′−1 ∈Gal
(
E(ω)/F(ω)
)
since Gal
(
E(ω)/F(ω)
)
▹Gal(E(ω)/F). Therefore
αβα−1 ∈Gal
(
E/E ∩F(ω)
)
,
and
Gal
(
E/E ∩F(ω)
)
▹Gal(E/F) .
Corollary 20.7. If E ̸⊂F(ω) and if Gal(E/F) is a simple group, then
Gal
(
E(ω)/F(ω)
) ∼= Gal(E/F) .
We can now prove the theorem itself. The heart of the proof is the fact that
An is a simple group if n ≥5.
Theorem 20.8. Let f ∈F[x] be an irreducible polynomial of  degree n ≥5 with Galois
group Sn. Then f cannot be solved by taking radicals.
Proof. Let E be the splitting field of f over F. Suppose that f can be solved by
radicals. First we adjoin δ, the square root of the discriminant, to F. By theorem
17.18 we know that
Gal
(
E/F(δ)
)
= An .
So we have the diagram:

374
CHAPTER 20. SOLUTION BY RADICALS
..E
.F(δ)
.F

.Sn
Suppose that the next step is to adjoin
m√a to F(δ). Thus F(δ,
m√a) is
a subfield of E. We can assume that F contains m distinct mth roots of 1.
Otherwise we adjoin ω, a primitive mth root of 1 and replace F and E by F(ω)
and E(ω) respectively. Then by the lemma, Gal
(
E(ω)/F(δ, ω)
) ∼= An. Set
H = Gal
(
E/F(δ,
m√a)
)
.
Since F(
m√a, δ) is the splitting field of xm −a over F(δ), by theorem 17.17, H
is a normal subgroup of An, and
Gal
(
F(δ,
m√a)/F(δ)
) ∼= An/H .
Here is the diagram:
..E
.F
(
δ,
m√a
)
.F(δ)
.H

But as we saw in theorem 12.7, An is simple for n > 4. This means that either
H = An and F(δ,
m√a)/F(δ) is trivial, or H is trivial and An = Gal
(
F(δ,
m√a)/F(δ)
)
,

which is cyclic. Both are impossible. Therefore f cannot be solved by taking rad-
icals.
Corollary 20.9 (Corollary to Proof). If Gal(f) ∼= An, n ≥5, then f is not solvable
by radicals.
One can go further and characterize algebraically the Galois groups of poly-
nomials which can be solved by radicals. They are a class of groups called solvable
groups.
Definition 20.10. A group G is solvable if it has a composition series
G = H0 ◃H1 ◃· · · ◃Hn−1 ◃Hn = {1}
where Hi/Hi+1 is a cyclic group of prime order, for 0 ≤i < n.
These turn out to be of great significance in group theory as well.

Ruler-and-Compass Constructions
21.1
Introduction
In this chapter we are going to look at geometric constructions you can make
with a ruler and compass. To be more precise, we should say straight edge and
compass, because we are only using the ruler to draw straight lines, not to make
measurements. It is not hard to bisect a line segment or an angle. You can also
construct an equilateral triangle or a square. But can you trisect an angle? What
other regular polygons can you construct?
Such geometric constructions can be translated into algebraic problems in-
volving the solution of polynomial equations. As an example, let's look at the
question of trisecting an angle. Suppose we want to trisect an angle τ, 0 < τ <
π/2 . We put the vertex of the angle at the point (0, 0) and one arm along the
x-axis. The other arm then passes through the point (cos τ, sin τ). Since
sin τ =
√
1 −cos2 τ ,
the angle is determined by the real number cos τ. Similarly, the angle τ/3 can be
measured from the x-axis and then it is determined by cos(τ/3).
Now we have the well-known triple angle formula:
cos τ = cos 3(τ/3) = 4 cos3(τ/3) −3 cos(τ/3) .
In other words, cos(τ/3) is a solution of the real cubic
4x3 −3x −cos τ = 0 .

Figure 21.1: Trisection of an angle
Trisecting the given angle τ is equivalent to solving this equation.
We are going to see that with ruler and compass we can perform construc-
tions which solve sequences of quadratic equations, but not cubic equations. For
this reason, trisecting an angle with such constructions is in general impossible.
Of course there are special angles, like π/2, which you can trisect in this way.
The fundamental criterion for constructibility in the next section only uses
the results on field extensions from chapter 16. It does not need any Galois the-
ory. The discussion of periods and explicit equations arising in the construction
of regular polygons in the following section does use Galois theory.
21.2
Algebraic Interpretation
We imagine that to start, we are given some points in the plane and some lengths.
Given a point we can construct its projections on the x- and y-axes, in other
words, its coordinates. Conversely we can construct a point from its x- and y-
coordinates. So we can assume that our given data simply consists of some real
numbers a1, . . . , ar. For the same reasons, when we ask what can be constructed
from this data, we need only look at the lengths that can be constructed. We

21.2. ALGEBRAIC INTERPRETATION
381
assume that we have chosen a unit length. Then let L ⊂R be the set of all
lengths that can be constructed with ruler and compass.
Theorem 21.1. L is a field containing Q(a1, . . . , ar). If b ∈L, then
√
b ∈L.
Proof. It is clear how to add two given lengths using a compass, or how to subtract
one from the other. How can one multiply two lengths b1 and b2? Mark the unit
length on the x-axis, and the length b1 on the y-axis. Join the two points.
.
.1
.b2
.b1
.b1b2
Now mark the length b2 on the x-axis. Draw a line through this point parallel to
the first line. It will meet the y-axis at the point b1b2. To construct b1/b2, switch
the roles of 1 and b2. Therefore L is a field. Since it contains a1, . . . , ar and
contains Q , it contains Q(a1, . . . , ar) .
To construct the square root of a given length b, mark 1 and 1 + b on a line.
Draw a semi-circle with diameter 1 + b. Draw the perpendicular from the point
1 to the semi-circle, and let its length be c.
The hypotenuses of the two right-angled triangles on the diameter are
√
1 + c2
and
√
b2 + c2 as shown. But the large triangle is also right-angled. Therefore
(1 + c2) + (b2 + c2) = (1 + b)2 ,

which implies that

For example, in exercise 16.4 you saw that the minimal polynomial of cos(2π/5)
is
4x2 + 2x −1 .
Therefore
cos(2π/5) =
√
5 −1
4
,
and we can construct cos(2π/5) with ruler and compass. This is the essential
step in constructing a regular pentagon. In [6], chapter 2, there is a more direct
construction.
This theorem can be interpreted in the following way. Suppose F ⊂L is
a subfield and b ∈F. Then any length in F(
√
b) is constructible. So if a real
number ζ lies in an extension field of Q(a1, . . . , ar) which can be built up as
a sequence of quadratic extensions, then ζ is constructible. On the other hand,
suppose that we have a construction that starts with a1, . . . , ar and gives us a
length ζ ∈L. It is built up out of three basic steps:
(i) intersect two lines;
(ii) intersect a line with a circle;

21.2. ALGEBRAIC INTERPRETATION
383
(iii) intersect two circles.
From an algebraic point of view, we are beginning with the base field Q(a1, . . . , ar)
and each step gives us a field extension. Let's analyze what sort of extension we
get in each case.
Let F be a subfield of R containing a1, . . . , ar. Suppose we have a line
passing through two points whose coordinates lie in F. Then its equation will be
of the form
ax + by + c = 0 ,
where a, b, c ∈F. If we have a second such line,
dx + ey + f = 0 ,
then the solution (x, y) of the pair of equations is the point of intersection. And
x and y belong to F. So when we intersect two lines we make no field extension.
Next suppose we are given a circle whose radius is in F, and whose centre is
a point with coordinates in F. Then it has an equation of the form
x2 + y2 + dx + ey + f = 0 ,
where d, e, f ∈F. If it meets a line
ax + by + c = 0 ,
a, b, c ∈F, then to find the coordinates of the two points of intersection, we
solve the linear equation, for x say (assuming that a ̸= 0), and substitute into the
quadratic. This gives us a quadratic equation in one variable y. If we adjoin a
square root of its discriminant ∆to F then the two solutions for y, and the cor-
responding values of x lie in F(
√
∆). So constructing the points of intersection
of a circle and a line corresponds to making a quadratic extension.
Lastly, suppose we are given two circles, determined by data in F, which meet:
x2 + y2 + ax + by + c = 0
x2 + y2 + dx + ey + f = 0 ,

384
CHAPTER 21. RULER-AND-COMPASS CONSTRUCTIONS
a, b, c, d, e, f ∈F. Subtracting, we get the equation
(a −d)x + (b −e)y + (c −f) = 0 .
A common solution of the two quadratic equations is a solution of the linear
equation. Therefore the linear equation gives the line passing through the points
of intersection of the two circles. So finding the points of intersection of two
circles can be reduced to finding the intersection of a circle and a line. Therefore,
the coordinates of the points of intersection will lie in a quadratic extension of
F too.
Summarizing, we have the following result:
Theorem 21.2. Given a1, . . . , ar ∈R, we can construct a real number ζ from a1, . . . , ar
using ruler and compass if  and only if ζ lies in an extension E/Q(a1, . . . , ar) which can be
built up as a sequence of  quadratic extensions.
Corollary 21.3. If ζ is constructible, then [Q(a1, . . . , ar, ζ) : Q(a1, . . . , ar)] is a
power of 2.
Proof. If ζ is constructible, then ζ ∈E, where E is an extension of Q(a1, . . . , ar),
which can be built up as a sequence of quadratic extensions. Thus
[Q(a1, . . . , ar, ζ) : Q(a1, . . . , ar)]
 [E : Q(a1, . . . , ar)] = 2k ,
for some k ≥0.
Examples 21.4.
(i) Suppose that we want to trisect the angle π/3. As dis-
cussed in the introduction, we begin with cos(π/3) = 1/2 ∈Q. We want
to construct cos(π/9), which is a root of
4x3 −3x −1/2 = 0 .
It is not hard to see that this polynomial is irreducible over Q. Therefore
[
Q
(
cos(π/9)
)
: Q
]
= 3 .
The theorem then tells us that cos(π/9) is not constructible.

21.3. CONSTRUCTION OF REGULAR POLYGONS
385
(ii) Suppose we want to duplicate the cube. This means that we begin with a
cube with unit volume, and want to construct one with volume 2. So the
sides of the new cube must have length
3√
2, and this is the number we
want to construct. But
[
Q
( 3√
2
)
: Q
]
= 3 .
Therefore
3√
2 is not constructible, and it is not possible to duplicate the
cube with a ruler-and-compass construction.
21.3
Construction of  Regular Polygons
If we inscribe a regular n-gon Pn in the unit circle about the origin in R2, with
one vertex at the point (1, 0), then the other vertices lie at the points
{ (
cos(2πk/n), sin(2πk/n)
)  0 < k < n
}
.
If we can construct
(
cos(2π/n), sin(2π/n)
)
then we can construct the other
vertices from it. This is the case precisely when its components are constructible.
Since
sin(2π/n) =
√
1 −cos2(2π/n) ,
we see that sin(2π/n) is constructible if and only if cos(2π/n) is. In exercise
17.11 you saw that
[Q(cos(2π/n)) : Q] = φ(n)/2 .
Therefore by corollary 21.3, if Pn is constructible, φ(n) must be a power of 2.
Conversely, suppose that φ(n) is a power of 2. Since
φ(n) = [En : Q] = |Gal(Φn)| ,
and
Gal(Φn) ∼= (Z/nZ)×

386
CHAPTER 21. RULER-AND-COMPASS CONSTRUCTIONS
this tells us that Gal(Φn) is an abelian 2-group (see p.317).
Therefore
Gal
(
Q(cos(2π/n))/Q
)
is as well. Then it follows from the first Sylow theo-
rem (see exercise 11.8) or from the classification of finite abelian groups, that
there is a chain of subgroups
{1} =: G0 < G1 < · · · < Gr := Gal
(
Q(cos(2π/n))/Q
)
,
where Gj/Gj−1 has order 2, for all j ≥1. Corresponding to this is a tower of
quadratic extensions
Q(cos(2π/n)) ⊃Fix(G1) ⊃· · · ⊃Q .
Therefore by our criterion for constructibility, cos(2π/n) is constructible.
So when is φ(n) a power of 2? In exercise 5.24 , we found that if
n = pj1
1 · · · pjr
r ,
with p1, . . . , pr distinct primes, then
φ(n) = pj1−1
1
(p1 −1) · · · pjr−1
r
(pr −1) .
So φ(n) is a power of 2 if and only if n factors as
n = 2jp1 · · · pr ,
where pk −1 is a power of 2 for each k. The question is then: for which primes
p is p−1 a power of 2? It is not hard to show that if 2l +1 is prime, then l = 2m
for some m. Primes of the form
22m + 1 ,
m > 0, are called Fermat primes. Here is a table of the first five:

21.4. PERIODS
387
For m = 5, we do not get a prime:
225 + 1 = 641 · 6700417 .
Constructions of the corresponding regular polygons are known for m = 1, 2, 3, 4.
One for the regular 17-gon is given in [6], chapter 2, as well as a pretty proof that
641 divides 225 + 1.
21.4
Periods
By looking closely at the cyclotomic extension E17/Q one can give an explicit
sequence of quadratic extensions which start with Q and end at Q(cos(2π/17)).
This is done by looking at the periods of a primitive 17th root of 1 in E17.
In general let p be a prime, p > 2, and let ω be a primitive pth root of 1. We
know that
Φp(x) = xp−1 + · · · + x + 1 ,
and that
G := Gal(Φp) ∼= (Z/pZ)× ,
which is cyclic. Let H be a subgroup of G of order h. Define the period
ωH :=
∑
β∈H
β(ω) ∈Ep .
If α ∈G is a generator with
α(ω) = ωj ,
and αk a generator of H, where hk = p −1, then
ωH =
h
∑
l=1
ωjkl .
For convenience we shall set
ωk := ω⟨αk⟩= ωH .

388
CHAPTER 21. RULER-AND-COMPASS CONSTRUCTIONS
Theorem 21.5.
Fix(H) = Q(ωH)
Proof. First, if γ ∈H, then
γ(ωH) =
∑
β∈H
γβ(ω) =
∑
β∈H
β(ω) = ωH .
Therefore
Q(ωH) ⊂Fix(H) .
On the other hand, suppose γ ̸∈H. The set {β(ω) | β ∈G} is just the set of
all primitive pth roots of 1, which is linearly independent over Q. Since
γH ∩H = ∅,
it follows that
γ(ωH) =
∑
β∈H
γβ(ω) ̸=
∑
β∈H
β(ω) = ωH .
Therefore
Gal
(
Ep/Q(ωH)
)
⊂H ,
which implies that
Q(ωH) ⊃Fix(H) .
So we have
Q(ωH) = Fix(H) .
Now let f
∈Q[x] be the minimal polynomial of ωH.
It has degree
[G : H]. For γ ∈G, γ(ωH) is a root of f. Therefore as γ runs through a
set of representatives of the cosets of H in G, we get a complete set of roots of
f. They are of the form
γ(ωH) =
∑
β∈H
γβ(ω) ,
and are called the h - fold periods of the cyclotomic field.

21.4. PERIODS
389
Examples 21.6.
(i) Take p = 7. So Gal(Φ7) is cyclic of order 6. It has
two non-trivial subgroups, one of order 2 and one of order 3. Let ω be a
primitive 7th root of unity. A generator of Gal(Φ7) is
α : ω 7→ω3 .
The subgroup H of order 2 is generated by α3. We have
ω3 := ω + α3(ω) = ω + ω6 = 2 cos(2π/7) .
It satisfies a cubic equation over Q :
(ω + ω6)2 = 2 + ω2 + ω5
(ω + ω6)3 = 3(ω + ω6) + ω3 + ω4 ,
and therefore
(ω + ω6)3 + (ω + ω6)2 −2(ω + ω6) −1 = 0 .
The other roots of x3 + x2 −2x −1 are
α(ω) + α4(ω) = ω3 + ω4
and
α2(ω) + α5(ω) = ω2 + ω5 ,
corresponding to the cosets αH and α2H. These are the three 2-fold
periods of E7.
The subgroup of order 3 is generated by α2, and the 3-fold periods are
ω + α2(ω) + α4(ω) = ω + ω2 + ω4
α(ω) + α3(ω) + α5(ω) = ω3 + ω6 + ω5 .
They are the roots of the quadratic equation:
x2 + x + 2 = 0 .

390
CHAPTER 21. RULER-AND-COMPASS CONSTRUCTIONS
(ii) Take p = 17. Then G := Gal(Φ17) is cyclic of order 16. It has non-trivial
subgroups of order 2, 4, and 8. If ω is a primitive 17th root of 1, then
α : ω 7→ω3
is a generator of G. Here is the chain of subgroups with the corresponding
tower of quadratic field extensions.

Now
ω2 = ω + ω9 + ω13 + ω15 + ω16 + ω8 + ω4 + ω2 ,
which is a root of
x2 + x −4 ∈Q[x] .
The other 8-fold period is
α(ω2) = ω3 + ω10 + ω5 + ω11 + ω14 + ω7 + ω12 + ω6 .
Next,
ω4 = ω + ω13 + ω16 + ω4 ,
which is a root of
x2 −ω2x −1 ∈Q(ω2) ,

21.5. EXERCISES
391
together with
α2(ω4) = ω9 + ω15 + ω8 + ω2 .
The field Q(ω4) also contains α(ω4) and α3(ω4). (These four are the roots
of the minimal polynomial of ω4 over Q). Thirdly,
ω8 = ω + ω16 = 2 cos(2π/17)
is a root of
x2 −ω4x + α(ω4) ∈Q(ω4) .
Lastly, ω is a root of
x2 −ω8x + 1 .
By theorem 21.2, cos(2π/17) can be constructed with ruler and compass,
and therefore so can the regular 17-gon.
