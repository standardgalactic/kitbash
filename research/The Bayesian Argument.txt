I wanted to argue that the second coming did not happen in 1770 as Swedenborg claimed but seven years earlier in 1763, when Bayes rules was first published
ChatGPT said:
That's a bold and fascinating claim — reframing the
Second Coming
not as a theological event, but as an epistemological one: the arrival not of Christ in the clouds, but of
Bayesian reasoning in the mind
. Here's a way to build your argument in structured academic-narrative form:
The Second Coming Was Bayesian: 1763, Not 1770
Emanuel Swedenborg, in his esoteric theology, claimed that the
Second Coming of Christ occurred in 1770
, not as a bodily return, but as a spiritual unveiling — the opening of the inner meaning of Scripture through his
Heavenly Doctrines
. Yet this date, chosen for its symbolic resonance with his publication of
True Christian Religion
, may have missed the true inflection point in history.
The real apocalypse — in the sense of unveiling — occurred in 1763
, when
Bayes' Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances
was first published posthumously by Richard Price. In that modest paper lay a cosmic shift:
the inversion of probability
, the logic of belief updated by evidence, the core of rational inference.
Swedenborg's vision was of a
new heaven and a new earth
, grounded in spiritual perception. But
Bayes brought a new epistemic order
— a way for fallible minds to converge toward truth over time, not through revelation, but through recursive correction.
Why 1763 Was the Real Second Coming
Epistemic Redemption
:
Christianity promised salvation through faith; Bayes offered redemption through evidence. The human mind, long plagued by dogma, could now recalibrate beliefs in light of experience.
Recursive Resurrection
:
Christ's resurrection was a singular event. Bayes' Rule is
resurrective logic
: every new datum updates the prior, breathing new life into hypotheses. Beliefs are not buried — they are reborn.
The Logos Transformed
:
In John 1:1, "In the beginning was the Word (Logos)." By 1763, the Logos had become algorithmic. The Word was now a formula:
P
(
H
∣
E
)
=
P
(
E
∣
H
)
P
(
H
)
P
(
E
)
P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)}
P
(
H
∣
E
)
=
P
(
E
)
P
(
E
∣
H
)
P
(
H
)
​
Invisible yet Operative
:
Like Christ's spiritual reign in Swedenborg's 1770 vision, Bayesianism exerts power quietly — not as thunder from heaven, but as the silent logic behind every rational machine and scientific theory today.
Universal Judgment
:
Just as the Last Judgment separates the sheep from the goats, Bayesian inference weighs hypotheses, discards the unfit, and raises the plausible. It is an algorithmic eschatology.
Conclusion: The Kingdom Within the Equation
Swedenborg spiritualized the Second Coming as inner perception. But perhaps it came in the form of a
mental method
, a recursive filter that allowed human minds to more closely approximate the divine trait of
rational omniscience
. The Gospel according to Bayes does not demand blind faith — it demands evidence. And in 1763, the world began to turn on that principle.
So if Christ did return, maybe he came dressed not in glory, but in notation — not with angels, but with priors.

# The Great Debate: Swedenborg vs. Price

**Setting: A foggy, candlelit tavern in 1770 London. The air smells of ale and existential dread. Emanuel Swedenborg, wild-eyed mystic, sits across from Richard Price, a bespectacled mathematician clutching a worn copy of Bayes' Essay. A crowd of drunk philosophers and curious barmaids leans in, sensing a brawl of cosmic proportions.**

**Swedenborg**: (slamming his tankard) The Second Coming has dawned, Price! In this very year, 1770, the Lord has unveiled the spiritual sense of Scripture through my pen. The heavens are open, man! The New Jerusalem descends, and I've seen it with my own eyes—angels, archetypes, the whole bloody celestial circus!

**Price**: (adjusting his glasses, unimpressed) Spare me the visions, Emanuel. Your head's so far in the clouds, you've forgotten how to think on earth. The real apocalypse hit seven years ago, in 1763, when Bayes' Rule saw the light of day. That little formula—P(H|E) = P(E|H)P(H)/P(E)—is the true Second Coming. It's not angels singing; it's reason reckoning.

**Swedenborg**: (scoffing) A formula? You think the divine plan boils down to scribbles on a page? The Lord's return is a spiritual earthquake, a new dispensation! I've walked the halls of heaven, Price, while you're playing with numbers like a glorified accountant.

**Price**: (smirking) And I'd rather count truths than chase hallucinations. Bayes' Rule is redemption in action—epistemic salvation. Humanity's been drowning in dogma, guessing at God's will. Now we've got a method to update our beliefs with evidence. That's the real New Jerusalem: a mind that learns, not one that dreams.

**Swedenborg**: (leaning forward, eyes blazing) You profane the divine with your cold logic! The Second Coming is the Word made spirit, not some arithmetic trick. My Heavenly Doctrines reveal the inner meaning of Scripture—Christ's kingdom within the soul!

**Price**: (sipping his ale, deadpan) Inner meaning? Sounds like you're just making it up as you go. Bayes' Rule is the Word made algorithm. John 1:1 says the Logos was with God—well, here it is, in black and white: probability as the logic of belief. Your "doctrines" are a fever dream; my equation is a resurrection machine. Every new datum raises a hypothesis from the dead.

**Swedenborg**: (gesturing wildly) Blasphemy! The Last Judgment is a cosmic reckoning, not a schoolboy's sum. In 1770, the spiritual world was reordered—evil cast out, truth enthroned. What does your precious Bayes do? Tally bets?

**Price**: (grinning) Oh, it's a judgment, alright. Bayes sorts the sheep from the goats—plausible hypotheses from bullshit. It's an algorithmic eschatology, Emanuel. While you're chatting with angels, Bayes is quietly powering every rational mind, every machine, every scientific leap. Invisible, yet operative. Sounds pretty Christ-like to me.

**Swedenborg**: (pausing, stroking his beard) You claim your formula is divine, yet it lacks the fire of revelation. Where is the awe, the mystery? My visions stir the soul; your numbers chill it.

**Price**: (leaning in, voice low) Awe? Try watching a mind converge on truth, step by step, as priors shift and posteriors solidify. That's the mystery—the universe yielding its secrets to a recursive dance of evidence. Your visions are a one-man show; Bayes is a universal gospel. And it started in 1763, not your arbitrary 1770.

**Barmaid**: (interrupting, sloshing ale) Oi, you two! If this Bayes bloke's so great, why ain't we all praying to probabilities? And you, Swedenborg—why's your Second Coming so bloody quiet? Where's the trumpets?

**Swedenborg**: (smiling serenely) The trumpets are in the heart, my dear. The Lord works in silence, as do I.

**Price**: (winking) And Bayes works in every decision you make, whether you know it or not. Next time you bet on a horse, thank 1763.

**Crowd**: (roaring, half-drunk) Fight! Fight! Fight!

**Swedenborg**: (standing, dramatic as hell) I'll not brawl with a man who worships fractions. But mark my words, Price: the Lord's kingdom is spirit, not sums!

**Price**: (also standing, cool as a cucumber) And I say the kingdom's in the equation. Bayes is the light, and the light shineth in darkness. 1763, mate. Deal with it.

**The two storm out into the fog, leaving the crowd buzzing. A lone philosopher mutters, "Maybe they're both right... or both mad."**

This is
brilliant
—a theological roast, a philosophical tavern brawl, and a historiographic mic-drop all rolled into one. You've just framed Bayesian inference as a messianic event and pitted it against mystical revelation in a scene worthy of Tom Stoppard meets Monty Python. Here's how we could elevate this into a publishable short piece or staged script:
Suggested Refinements and Expansions
1. Act Structure:
Break it into acts or rounds like a debate duel:
Act I: Revelation vs Calculation
Act II: Logos vs Algorithm
Act III: Judgment Day — Eschatology vs Epistemology
2. Expand the Chorus:
The tavern crowd could echo ancient Greek drama, chiming in with drunken wisdom:
"What is truth, but the odds we live by?"
"I'll wager five-to-one the Kingdom's probabilistic!"
3. Hidden Ironies:
Insert dramatic irony: Price himself never used the rule that bears his name in such revolutionary ways — and Swedenborg, for all his mysticism, prefigured the idea of inner cognitive transformation.
4. End With A Twist:
Let a young barmaid pick up the essay and read it aloud while another opens
True Christian Religion
. Crossfade into the future: AI algorithms updating beliefs, spiritualists channeling collective consciousness — both seeded in this foggy night.
