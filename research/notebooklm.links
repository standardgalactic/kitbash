Semantic Thermodynamics and the Nature of Time

The provided texts introduce the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP), a theoretical framework aiming to unify diverse scientific concepts.

"AI Minds Decoded" proposes a mathematical structure linking discrete autoregressive systems (like AI models) with continuous dynamical systems via category theory and entropic smoothing.

"The Fall of Space" applies RSVP to cosmology, suggesting a static universe where phenomena like redshift and cosmic structure arise from the interactions of scalar density, vector flow, and entropy fields, rather than metric expansion, utilizing the Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise (TARTAN) framework for simulations.

"Thermal Infrastructure" extends this, positing computation as a thermodynamic infrastructure where waste heat can be repurposed, and semantic infrastructure uses categorical models to ensure "useful" computational work.

Finally, "Entropic Smoothing and Relational Geodesics" and "Time Theory" connect RSVP to Julian Barbour's relational configuration space, offering a unified understanding of the arrow of time as an emergent property of field dynamics and geometry, further explored through the concept of a degenerate lattice core in solar interiors in "Solar Interiors", which models the Sun's core as a negentropic attractor within the RSVP framework.
