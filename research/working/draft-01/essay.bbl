\bibitem{anderson2022}
Monica Anderson.
\newblock Bubble city and model-free methods, 1990--2000s.
\newblock Bubble City proposed a ``penny-to-post'' monetary friction model for
  filtering spam; Model-Free Methods explored cognition beyond symbolic AI. In
  the monograph, Bubble City is treated as a precursor to RSVP: elegant but
  susceptible to speculation and inequity, demonstrating the superiority of
  informational friction.

\bibitem{barandes2023}
Jacob Barandes.
\newblock Unistochastic quantum theory, 2022--2025.
\newblock Parallels RSVP’s shift from waste/weakness to informational
  coherence as a trust primitive, though not directly about security. Provides
  conceptual support for probabilistic reformulations of systems.

\bibitem{conitzer2020}
Vincent Conitzer.
\newblock Human-weakness cryptography.
\newblock 2010--2016.
\newblock Key papers proposing the use of human cognitive limitations (e.g.,
  memory interference, divided attention, non-transferable skills) as security
  primitives. These works exemplify the ``weakness as proof'' paradigm
  critiqued in the monograph for yielding exclusionary and informationally
  negative systems.

\bibitem{eriksen1985}
Charles~W. Eriksen and Yue Yeh.
\newblock Allocation of attention in the visual field.
\newblock {\em Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and
  Performance}, 11(5):583--597, 1985.
\newblock Established empirical limits of human attention, cited by Conitzer.
  Reinterpreted in the monograph: attention limits should not be exploited as
  gates but understood as ecological constraints for designing coherent
  systems.

\bibitem{jans2010}
Bert Jans, Judith~C. Peters, and Peter De~Weerd.
\newblock Visual spatial attention to multiple locations at once.
\newblock {\em Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience}, 22(4):613--625, 2010.
\newblock Demonstrates variability in human attention capacity, supporting the
  monograph’s argument that weakness-based tests are unreliable and
  exclusionary.

\bibitem{mccormick1990}
P.~A. McCormick and R.~Klein.
\newblock The spatial distribution of attention.
\newblock {\em Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and
  Performance}, 16(2):323--334, 1990.
\newblock Further evidence on divided attention limits, reinforcing the
  variability critique against weakness-based security.

\bibitem{mnih2013}
Volodymyr Mnih et~al.
\newblock Deep reinforcement learning for video games.
\newblock {\em arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602}, 2013.
\newblock Showed that reinforcement learning can master complex cognitive-motor
  tasks, undermining the assumption that non-transferable human skills are
  secure primitives. Supports the critique that human-weakness cryptography is
  brittle against AI capabilities.

\bibitem{nakamoto2008}
Satoshi Nakamoto.
\newblock Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system.
\newblock \url{https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf}, 2008.
\newblock Established proof-of-work as waste-as-security. Serves as the
  canonical case of civic absurdity: ecological cost without informational
  value.

\bibitem{prigogine1984}
Ilya Prigogine.
\newblock {\em Order Out of Chaos: Man’s New Dialogue with Nature}.
\newblock Bantam, 1984.
\newblock Introduced dissipative structures as models of order-through-entropy.
  RSVP builds on this tradition: entropy is not always destructive but must be
  balanced against coherence and density.

\bibitem{shannon1948}
Claude~E. Shannon.
\newblock A mathematical theory of communication.
\newblock {\em Bell System Technical Journal}, 27(3):379--423, 1948.
\newblock Provided the foundational entropy measure used in RSVP (S). RSVP
  extends Shannon entropy into a civic context: entropy as redundancy and
  disorder in messages, civic, and economic systems.

\bibitem{szegedy2014}
Christian Szegedy et~al.
\newblock Intriguing properties of neural networks.
\newblock {\em arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.6199}, 2014.
\newblock Showed that imperceptible perturbations can mislead AI, warning that
  reliance on human weaknesses for security is brittle. RSVP’s informational
  approach is robust to both human and AI variations.

\bibitem{vonahn2003}
Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, and John Langford.
\newblock Captchas and human computation.
\newblock 2003--2004.
\newblock Demonstrated the use of human cognitive strengths to distinguish
  humans from bots, a precursor to weakness-based cryptography. Provides
  contrast: CAPTCHAs align human uniqueness with security, whereas RSVP aligns
  informational usefulness.
