  author = {Conitzer, Vincent},
  title = {Human-Weakness Cryptography},
  year = {2010--2016},
  note = {Key papers proposing the use of human cognitive limitations (e.g., memory interference, divided attention, non-transferable skills) as security primitives. These works exemplify the ``weakness as proof'' paradigm critiqued in the monograph for yielding exclusionary and informationally negative systems.}

  title = {Bubble City and Model-Free Methods},
  year = {1990--2000s},
  note = {Bubble City proposed a ``penny-to-post'' monetary friction model for filtering spam; Model-Free Methods explored cognition beyond symbolic AI. In the monograph, Bubble City is treated as a precursor to RSVP: elegant but susceptible to speculation and inequity, demonstrating the superiority of informational friction.}

  title = {CAPTCHAs and Human Computation},
