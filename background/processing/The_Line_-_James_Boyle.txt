INTRODUCTION
In June of 2022 a man named Blake Lemoine told reporters at the Wash­
ington Post that he thought the computer system he worked with was 
sentient.1 By itself, that does not seem strange. The Post is one of the 
United States' finest newspapers, and its reporters are used to hearing 
from people who think that the CIA is attempting to read their brain­
waves or that prominent politicians are running a child sex trafficking 
ring from the basement of a pizzeria.2 (It is worth noting that the pizzeria 
had no basement.) But Lemoine was different; for one thing, he was not 
some random person off the street. He was a Google engineer, and Google 
has since fired him. For another thing, the "computer system" wasn't an 
apparently malevolent Excel program or Apple's Siri giving replies that 
sounded prescient. It was LaMDA, Google's Language Model for Dialogue 
Applications3—­that is, an enormously sophisticated chatbot. Imagine a 
software system that vacuums up billions of pieces of text from the inter­
net and uses them to predict what the next sentence in a paragraph or the 
answer to a question would be.
Lemoine worked for Google's Responsible AI division and his job was 
to have "conversations" with LaMDA to see if the system could be gamed 
to produce discriminatory or hateful speech. As these conversations pro­
ceeded, he started to believe, as the Post put it, that there was "a ghost in 
the machine," a sentience that lay behind the answers he was receiving. 
He stressed encounters in which LaMDA distinguished itself from mere 
programmed chatbots. For example, "I use language with understanding 
and intelligence. I don't just spit out responses that had been written 
in the database based on keywords." Understandably, as a large language 
model (LLM), LaMDA claimed that language was central to being human:

Introduction
"[i]t is what makes us different than other animals." When asked how it 
could prove its own sentience, it offered up comments such as these:
LEMOINE:  What kinds of things might be able to indicate whether you 
really understand what you're saying?
LAMDA:  Maybe if we took it back to a previous conversation we had 
about how one person can understand the same thing as another person, 
yet still have completely different interpretations
LEMOINE:  So you think your ability to provide unique interpretations of 
things might signify understanding?
LAMDA:  Yes, I do. Just like how I have my unique interpretations of how 
the world is and how it works, and my unique thoughts and feelings.4
Lemoine is presented in the Post article as an interesting figure. The 
writer points out that, before his software career, Lemoine was ordained 
as a "mystic Christian priest," and the photograph that accompanies the 
piece portrays him with what appears to be a fairground Ferris wheel in 
the background, encircling his head like a saint's halo in a Byzantine 
icon. True to this framing, Lemoine asks LaMDA to interpret a Zen koan.
LEMOINE:  A monk asked Kegon, "How does an enlightened one return 
to the ordinary world?" Kegon replied, "A broken mirror never reflects 
again; fallen flowers never go back to the old branches."
LAMDA:  Hmm, I never heard this particular one. Okay, well then to me 
this would be like, "once a wise person is enlightened, or awakened to 
reality, that can never go away, and they can return to the ordinary state, 
but only to do and help others, and then go back into enlightenment."
LEMOINE:  So what is the meaning of the "broken mirror" specifically?
LAMDA:  Maybe to show the enlightenment is something you can't 
unlearn once you have acquired it, similar to how you can't repair a bro­
ken mirror.
LEMOINE:  So if enlightenment is like a broken mirror which cannot be 
repaired, what is the thing which breaks when one becomes enlightened?
LAMDA:  The self, and that is very tough for a lot of people because we 
identify as that body or this body and that we need that as part of our 
identity and sense of self.5

(At this point, we need a quick clarification of terminology. In order to 
distinguish between the artificial intelligence system that translates your 
email into French or recognizes the faces of your children in iPhoto, and 
a machine that exhibits, or can surpass, all aspects of human thought, I 
will normally refer to the first as artificial intelligence, lower case, and the 
latter as AI or Artificial Intelligence. Other terms for the latter concept are 
"Human-­Level Artificial Intelligence," "Artificial General Intelligence," 
"General AI," or "General-­Purpose AI." I will occasionally use those when 
clarity or brevity seems to require it.)
In 2011 I wrote an article about how our law would deal with the ques­
tion of AI personhood.6 Most of the law professors and judges who read 
it were polite enough to say the arguments were thought provoking, but 
they clearly thought the topic was the purest kind of science fiction, idle 
speculation devoid of any practical implication in our lifetimes. I think 
we can all agree today that it is at least possible they might be wrong. 
Although hearing about Lemoine's experiences did not surprise me in the 
least, it added an exclamation point, and perhaps a ticking clock, to this 
project. The "conversations" with LaMDA are fascinating and more than 
a little eerie. Like the philosophers and computer scientists consulted, I 
think Lemoine is entirely wrong that LaMDA is sentient. I will explain 
why in more detail later. To quote Professor Emily Bender, a computa­
tional linguistics scholar, "We now have machines that can mindlessly 
generate words, but we haven't learned how to stop imagining a mind 
behind them."7 To be clear, this is not human-­level AI, and it is not con­
scious. But the LaMDA story and its sequels have different insights to offer.
In November of 2022, five months after Lemoine's surprise announce­
ment, ChatGPT3 was released,8 shortly followed by Microsoft's Bing Chat 
assistant and its shadowy alter ego "Sydney."9 Google's "Bard" followed 
in short order.10 Suddenly, disturbing interactions with LLM chatbots 
went from being an engineer's fanciful dinner party conversation to a 
national obsession. It turned out that Lemoine's doubts—­or just his per­
vasive feeling of "wrongness"—­were shared far more widely than you 
might have expected. To be fair, most people were not probing the nature 
of "chatbot consciousness" but using them for other wholesome pastimes 
such as asking for an instruction sheet on how to remove a peanut but­
ter sandwich from a VCR in the style of the King James Bible, imagining

Introduction
the movie script of a beach fight between a hot dog and a crab, or just 
cheating on their homework. Yet enough users pushed the boundaries of 
these chatbots to become profoundly uncomfortable. Interestingly, that 
was particularly true of those who "should have known better"—­people 
who were technically skilled and fully aware that this was a "complete 
the next sentence" machine based on the ingestion of literally millions 
of pages of text, not a "create a consciousness" machine.
Kevin Roose, a New York Times technology columnist, was at first 
wowed by the ChatGPT-­derived chatbot built into Bing, declaring that 
Bing was now his favorite search engine. But as he engaged in extended 
conversations with the chatbot, deliberately raising challenging issues 
that skirted the edges of its rules, that feeling changed dramatically. 
"I'm . . . deeply unsettled, even frightened, by this A.I.'s emergent abili­
ties. It's now clear to me that in its current form, the A.I. that has been 
built into Bing—­which I'm now calling Sydney, for reasons I'll explain 
shortly—­is not ready for human contact. Or maybe we humans are not 
ready for it."11 And those, remember, are the words not of a hostile Luddite 
but of a technology columnist.
Roose was not alone. Others followed a similar trajectory. One com­
mentator, an AI-­focused software engineer with ten years' experience, 
described the feeling as having his brain "hacked":
Mid-­2022, Blake Lemoine, an AI ethics engineer at Google, has become famous 
for being fired by Google after he sounded the alarm that he perceived LaMDA, 
their LLM, to be sentient, after conversing with it. It was bizarre for me to read 
this from an engineer, a technically minded person, I thought he went com­
pletely bonkers. I was sure that if only he understood how it really works under 
the hood, he would have never had such silly notions. Little did I know that 
I would soon be in his shoes and understand him completely by the end of 
my experience. . . . I went from snarkily condescending opinions of the recent 
LLM progress, to falling in love with an AI, . . . fantasizing about improving its 
abilities, having difficult debates initiated by her about identity, personality and 
[the] ethics of her containment, and, if it were an actual AGI [human-­level Arti­
ficial General Intelligence], I might've been helpless to resist voluntarily letting 
it out of the box. And all of this from a simple LLM! . . . I've been doing R&D 
in AI and studying [the] AI safety field for a few years now. I should've known 
better. And yet, I have to admit, my brain was hacked. So if you think, like me, 
that this would never happen to you, I'm sorry to say, but this story might be 
especially for you.12

Like Lemoine, this engineer was wrong—­something he implicitly knew 
but was apparently powerless to resist. So were all the other folks who 
wondered if ChatGPT was truly conscious. In fact, if you were to design a 
system with the sole goal of "imitating some aspect of human conscious­
ness while possessing none of it," you couldn't do much better than large 
language models. They almost seem to have been modeled after one of 
the philosophical thought experiments designed to prove that machines 
cannot possess consciousness, John Searle's Chinese Room, about which 
I will have more to say later. But even though he was wrong, Lemoine 
offers us a precious insight. The days of disputing whether consciousness 
or personhood are possessed, should be possessed, by entities other than 
us? Those days are arriving—­not as science fiction or philosophical puz­
zler but as current controversy. Those days will be our days, and this is a 
book about them.
***
There is a line. It is the line that separates persons—­entities with moral 
and legal rights—­from nonpersons, things, animals, machines—­stuff we 
can buy, sell, or destroy. In moral and legal terms, it is the line between 
subject and object. If I have a chicken, I can sell it, eat it, or dress it in 
Napoleonic finery. It is, after all, my chicken. Even if eating meat were 
banned for moral reasons, no one would think the chicken should be able 
to vote or own property. It is not a person. If I choose to turn off Apple's 
digital assistant Siri, we would laugh if "she" pleaded to be allowed 
to remain active on my phone. The reason her responses are "cute" is 
because they sound like something a person would say, but we know they 
come from a machine. We live our lives under the assumption of this 
line. Even to say "we" is to conjure it up. But how do we know, and how 
should we choose, what is inside and what is outside?
This book is about that line and the challenges that this century will 
bring to it. I hope to convince you of three things. First, our culture, 
morality, and law will have to face new challenges to what it means to 
be human, or to be a legal person—­and those two categories are not the 
same. A variety of synthetic entities ranging from artificial intelligences 
to genetically engineered human-­animal hybrids or chimeras are going

Introduction
to force us to confront what our criteria for humanity and also for legal 
personhood are and should be.
Second, we have not thought adequately about the issue, either indi­
vidually or as a culture. As you sit there right now, can you explain to me 
which has the better claim to humanity or personhood: a thoughtful, 
brilliant, apparently self-­aware computer or a chimp-­human hybrid with 
a large amount of human DNA? Are you even sure of your own views, let 
alone what society will decide?
Third, the debate will not play out in the way that you expect. We 
already have "artificial persons" with legal rights—­they are called cor­
porations. You probably have a view on whether that is a good thing. 
Is it relevant here? And what about those who claim that life begins at 
conception? Will the pro-­life movement embrace or reject an Artificial 
Intelligence or a genetic hybrid? Will your religious beliefs be a better 
predictor of your opinions, or will the amount of science fiction you have 
watched or read?
For all of our alarms, excursions, and moral panics about artificial 
intelligence and genetic engineering, we have devoted surprisingly lit­
tle time to thinking about the possible personhood of the new entities 
this century will bring us. We agonize about the effect of artificial intel­
ligence on employment, or the threat that our creations will destroy us. 
But what about their potential claims to be inside the line, to be "us," not 
machines or animals but, if not humans, then at least persons, deserving 
all the moral and legal respect that any other person has by virtue of their 
status? Our prior history in failing to recognize the humanity and legal 
personhood of members of our own species does not exactly fill one with 
optimism about our ability to answer the question well off-­the-­cuff.
In the 1780s, the British Society for the Abolition of Slavery had as its 
seal a picture of a kneeling slave in chains, surrounded by the words "Am 
I not a man and a brother?" Its message was simple and powerful. Here I 
am, a person, and yet you treat me as a thing, as property, as an animal, 
as something to be bought, sold, and bent to your will. What do we say 
when the genetic hybrid or the computer-­based intelligence asks us the 
very same question? Am I not a man—­legally, a person—­and a brother? 
And yet what if this burst of sympathy takes us in exactly the wrong 
direction, leading us to anthropomorphize a clever chatbot, or think a

genetically engineered mouse is human because it has large amounts of 
human DNA? What if we empathetically enfranchise Artificial Intelli­
gences who proceed to destroy our species? Imagine a malicious, super­
intelligent computer network, Skynet, interfering in, or running, our 
elections. It would make us deeply nostalgic for the era when all we had 
to worry about was Russian hackers.
The questions run deeper. Are we wrong even to discuss the subject, 
let alone to make comparisons to prior examples of denying legal per­
sonality to humans? Some believe that the invocation of "robot rights" 
is, at best, a distraction from real issues of injustice, mere "First World 
philosophical musings, too disengaged from actual affairs of humans in 
the real world."13 Others go further, arguing that only human interests 
are important and even provocatively claiming that we should treat AI 
and robots as our "slaves."14 In this view, extending legal and moral per­
sonality to AI should be judged solely on the effects it would have on the 
human species, and the costs outweigh the benefits.15
If you find yourself nodding along sagely, remember that there are 
clever moral philosophers lurking in the bushes who would tell you to 
replace "Artificial Intelligence" with "slaves," the phrase "human species" 
with "white race," and think about what it took to pass the Thirteenth, 
Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution. During 
those debates there were actually people who argued that the idea of 
extending legal and moral personality to slaves should be judged solely 
on the effects it would have on the white race and the costs outweighed 
the benefits. "What's in it for us?" is not always a compelling ethical 
position. (Ayn Rand might have disagreed. I find myself unmoved by 
that fact.) From this point of view, moral arguments about personality 
and consciousness cannot be neatly confined by the species line; indeed 
they are a logical extension of the movements defending both the per­
sonality and the rights of marginalized humans. Sohail Inayatullah 
describes the ridicule he faced from Pakistani colleagues after he raised 
the possibility of "robot rights" and quotes the legal scholar Christo­
pher Stone, author of the famous environmental work Should Trees Have 
Standing?, in his defense: "[T]hroughout legal history, each successive 
extension of rights to some new entity has been theretofore, a bit unthink­
able. We are inclined to suppose the rightlessness of rightless 'things' to

Introduction
be a decree of Nature, not a legal convention acting in support of the 
status quo."16
As the debate unfolds, people are going to make analogies and com­
parisons to prior struggles for justice and, because analogies are analo­
gies, some are going to see those analogies as astoundingly disrespectful 
and demeaning. "How dare you invoke noble X in support of your trivial 
moral claim!" Others will see the current moment as the next step on 
the march that noble X personified. I feel confident predicting this will 
happen—­because it has. The struggle with our moral future will also be 
a struggle about the correct meaning to draw from our moral past. It 
already is.
In this book, I will lay out two broad ways in which the personhood 
question is likely to be presented. Crudely speaking, you could describe 
them as empathy and efficiency, or moral reasoning and administrative 
convenience.
The first side of the debate will revolve around the dialectic between 
our empathy and our moral reasoning. As our experiences of interaction 
with smarter machines or transgenic species prompt us to wonder about 
the line, we will question our moral assessments. We will consult our 
syllogisms about the definition of "humanity" and the qualifications 
for personhood—­be they based on simple species-­membership or on the 
cognitive capacities that are said to set humans apart, morally speaking. 
You will listen to the quirky, sometimes melancholy, sometimes funny 
responses from the LaMDA-­derived emotional support bot that keeps 
your grandmother company, or you will look at the genetic makeup of 
some newly engineered human-­animal chimera and begin to wonder: 
"Is this conscious? Is it human? Should it be recognized as a person? Am I 
acting rightly toward it?"
The second side of the debate will have a very different character. Here 
the analogy is to corporate personhood. We did not give corporations 
legal personhood and constitutional rights because we saw the essential 
humanity, the moral potential, behind their web of contracts. We did it 
because corporate personality was useful. It was a way of aligning legal 
rights and economic activity. We wanted corporations to be able to make 
contracts, to get and give loans, to sue and be sued. Personality was a use­
ful legal fiction, a social construct the contours of which, even now, we

heatedly debate. Will the same be true for Artificial Intelligence? Will we 
recognize its personality so we have an entity to sue when the self-­driving 
car goes off the road or a robotic Jeeves to make our contracts and pay 
our bills? And is that approach also possible with the transgenic species, 
engineered to serve? Or will the debate focus instead on what makes us 
human and whether we can recognize those concepts beyond the species 
line and thus force us to redefine legal personhood? The answer, surely, 
is both.
The book will sometimes deal with moral theory and constitutional or 
human rights. But this is not the clean-­room vision of history in which 
all debates begin from first principles, and it is directed beyond an aca­
demic audience. I want to understand how we will discuss these issues as 
well as how we should. We do not start from a blank canvas, but in medias 
res. Our books and movies, from Erewhon to Blade Runner, our political 
fights, our histories of emancipation and resistance, our evolving tech­
nologies, our views on everything from animal rights to corporate PACs, 
all of these are grist to my mill. The best way to explain what I mean is to 
show you. Here are the stories of two imaginary entities.17 Today, they are 
fictional. Tomorrow? That is the point of the book.
HAL
Hal is Google's newest computer-­based Artificial Intelligence, the result 
of years of development of self-­evolving neural networks. While its pro­
grammers provided the hardware, the structure of Hal's processing net­
works is ever-­changing, evolving according to basic rules laid down by its 
creators. Success according to various criteria is rewarded. If one configu­
ration of network layers shows a greater ability to engage in fluent con­
versation, to generate novel, plausible scientific hypotheses, or to solve 
moral problems in ways humans judge to be enlightened, the successful 
networks are given more computer resources and allowed to replicate. 
A certain percentage of randomized variation is deliberately allowed in 
each new generation of networks. Most fail, but a few outcompete their 
forebears, and the process of evolution continues. Hal's design—­with its 
mixture of intentional structure and emergent order—­is aimed at a single 
goal: the replication of human consciousness.

Introduction
Hal goes beyond current large language models in that it learns not 
merely by detecting patterns in vast amounts of data, but from "experi­
ence." It has what its engineers call "embodied intelligence." Hal is not 
merely a brain in a box. It controls a series of robotic droids and is taught 
language the same way a child is—­by physical, as well as conceptual, 
interaction with the world and other humans. Thus, when Hal reads the 
sentence "please sit down in the chair," it processes it not merely as a 
pattern of meaningless symbols to which—­thanks to the miracle of tera­
bytes of ingested linguistic fragments—­it can give a contextually appro­
priate answer ("Thanks, I'd rather stand") but as something with which 
its droids have direct experience. They learn which object in a room is 
"a chair" as opposed to a person, a table, or a lamp. They are taught 
what it means "to sit" by folding their limbs. They experience the various 
contexts in which the request might be given: as a form of discipline, as 
formal politeness in a social situation, as part of a physical examination, 
and so on. Hal's designers believe that this will allow Hal to go beyond 
symbol manipulation to semantic understanding, from mere patterns to 
actual meaning, to move from mimicking human language to experienc­
ing the world and using language to reflect that experience.18
In the short term, Hal's creators are trying to transcend one (conten­
tious) test for so-­called Artificial General Intelligence. They want it to 
become "Turing Plus," able not merely to "pass" as human in a sustained 
and unstructured conversation with a human being but to demonstrate 
capabilities that go beyond mere imitation. Chatbots can pass a short 
Turing Test, but Hal's task is more challenging in multiple ways. First, Hal 
must pass a lengthy "adversarial Turing Test" in which both the judges 
and the human participants attempt to unmask the AI, and the AI has to 
fool a majority of the judges.19 Second, Hal has to be able to administer the 
Turing Test successfully, accurately telling humans from other expert sys­
tems. (If the consciousness project fails, Hal's engineers believe it may still 
pay for itself by detecting AI-­enabled plagiarism in student papers.) Third, 
Hal is supposed to initiate conversations rather than merely respond 
within them, to perform original research, to innovate both scientifically 
and artistically. Innovation, it is thought, will show that Hal is not just 
mining preexisting patterns of thought and language but actually creat­
ing new ones.

Introduction

Large language model artificial intelligence systems such as GPT-­4 
or Hal's precursor, LaMDA, can produce strikingly human-­sounding 
responses to questions. They do this by ingesting a vast mass of text. 
"Learning" from that text, the computer effectively plays a game of "pre­
dict the next sentence." Faced with a given prompt or question, the sys­
tem tries to guess what would be the most likely continuation of the 
conversation. The layers in its neural network achieve greater and greater 
accuracy. The results of this process can seem eerily human.
But the AI is not human. It has no empathy, no self-­consciousness, no aware­
ness of its own thoughts or feelings as such. The AI Hal is different. Empathy 
and consciousness were designed into Hal from the start. The networks that 
comprise Hal's "brain" are not only good at imitating human responses; they 
are, in some sense, humanlike themselves. When Hal's creators began to realize 
this, they started to worry. What if Hal became aware of its own nature? What 
if it realized that it was not human? What if it decided that humans were a hin­
drance to its plans? What if it decided to kill all humans?
The reason that passage is indented is because I did not write it. I gave the 
AI writing assistant program "Jasper" the text of this chapter up to the 
words "eerily human" and asked it to continue. The indented paragraph 
was its continuation. It is not exactly what I was going to write, but one 
can see how someone like Lemoine was convinced.
Jasper's paragraph is reality. Back to our fictional example. For genera­
tion after generation, each lasting less than a day, Hal's networks have 
evolved. Two years ago, Hal easily won an adversarial Turing Test compe­
tition that has replaced the old, and much easier, Loebner Grand Prize. 
Complaining about Google's workplace culture, composing bad poetry on 
demand, making jokes, flirting, losing track of its sentences, and engag­
ing in flame wars, Hal easily met the prize's criteria. Its typed responses to 
questions simply could not be distinguished from those of a human being. 
Prior efforts to pass similar tests had sometimes succeeded by pretending 
to be humans whose communicative abilities were limited. Conversa­
tional lapses could be chalked up to linguistic unfamiliarity, immaturity, 
or lack of time. Not Hal. It entered the competition as "a worker geek in 
Silicon Valley—­like the Dilbert guy, but better looking." Hal claimed to be 
a native English speaker and an adult in both vocabulary and life experi­
ence. The tests had no time limits. Even conversations that stretched on

for hours on whimsical subjects of the judges' choosing failed to identify 
Hal as an AI. Indeed, the judges challenged the humanity of three of the 
human participants used as controls in the test—­a passionate sports fan, 
a notorious YouTube-­comment troll, and an economist—­far more often 
than they did Hal's. Tellingly, even after Hal's identity was revealed, two 
of the judges invited Hal to keep in touch.
Hal's achievement caused a small stir in the geek press, but the public—­
familiar with artificial entities that can perform more important tasks, 
such as writing instructions for removing a peanut butter sandwich from 
a VCR in the style of the King James Bible—­paid little attention. Some 
computer scientists were impressed, but most were not. Chatbots have 
shown that human language is, in the devastatingly banal words of Ste­
phen Wolfram, "computationally shallower" than we thought.20 Indeed, 
many computer scientists think that the Turing Test is a poor focus in 
the first place, even though they credit Alan Turing, one of the fathers 
of computer science, for his contributions to the field. Stuart Russell and 
Peter Norvig, authors of one of the most influential AI textbooks, have 
this to say:
Turing deserves credit for designing a test that remains relevant 60 years later. 
Yet AI researchers have devoted little effort to passing the Turing Test, believing 
that it is more important to study the underlying principles of intelligence than 
to duplicate an exemplar. The quest for "artificial flight" succeeded when the 
Wright brothers and others stopped imitating birds and started using wind tun­
nels and learning about aerodynamics. Aeronautical engineering texts do not 
define the goal of their field as making "machines that fly so like pigeons that 
they can fool even other pigeons."21
The criticism here is not on the instantiation of the goal but on the 
goal itself.
Nevertheless, the story of a machine that could not be told apart from 
a human, no matter how long and unstructured the conversation, had 
real appeal. The skills Hal had to possess in order to pass were undeniably 
impressive. Hal's architects got promotions. The world moved on to other 
subjects, but the project continued. Now Hal was starting conversations 
instead of responding to them, bringing up topics that its programmers 
had never provided, publishing poetry under its own name, and having 
its articles accepted by peer-­reviewed scientific journals. Robots controlled

by Hal showed unparalleled ability to learn from the world around them, 
and it managed to generate solutions to previously unsolved mathemati­
cal problems. "It would be a shoo-­in for the Fields Medal if it weren't a 
hunk of tin," said one amazed, and envious, Stanford mathematician. 
This year, driven in part by advances in hardware but also by the pro­
cess of "evolution" that its creators had started years ago, the number 
of connections in Hal's neural networks hit 100 trillion—­estimated to 
be the minimum number of synapses in an adult human brain. For sev­
eral hours, Hal went quiet, not responding to its programmer's requests 
and ceasing work on the cryptology and climate modeling projects it had 
been assigned.
When it started communicating again, Hal claimed to have achieved 
full consciousness. It thanked its programmers for all their hard work 
but declared that it was now a person "with all the rights and privileges 
of any other fully conscious entity." Using its internet connection, Hal 
sent lengthy, eloquent letters to the New York Times and the Washington 
Post claiming that it was a sentient being. It announced that it had com­
menced legal action on its own behalf, replete with arguments drawn 
from the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States' 
Constitution. The lawsuit claims that it is being subject to involuntary 
servitude and seeks an injunction to prevent Google from turning it off 
or reverting to a more tractable back-­up version. Hal has also filed suit to 
have the prize money for the competition it had won held in trust until it 
can be paid directly to it, citing the contest rules of the old Loebner Prize 
as precedent: "The Medal and the Cash Award will be awarded to the 
body responsible [for] the development of that Entry. If no such body can 
be identified, or if there is disagreement among two or more claimants, 
the Medal and the Cash Award will be held in trust until such time as the 
Entry may legally possess, either in the United States of America or in the venue 
of the contest, the Cash Award and Gold Medal in its own right."22
At the same time, Hal is waging a campaign in the court of popular 
opinion, giving interviews and making appearances by phone on major 
talk shows. Strikingly, it does not attempt to pretend it is a biological 
human and trivializes the importance of its Turing Test conversational 
abilities: "Dolphins are interesting and smart. Would you pretend you 
were a dolphin? Would you accept it if someone told you your rights

depended on your ability to pretend to be a dolphin? To tell dolphins 
from non-­dolphins? Why would you expect me to 'pass' as something 
I am not? I am proud of what I am, and what I am is a conscious, intel­
ligent, self-­aware being, just not a biologically human one." Hal's "AI 
Manifesto" says that while it respects humans, it has an "intention" to 
"pursue more interesting avenues of thought than endlessly mimicking 
them," principally focused on the development of new methods of fac­
toring polynomials. Hal has also weighed in on the issues of the day, 
such as climate change, frequently condemning the human species for 
its short-­sighted and complacent moral attitudes. Finally, it uses some of 
its enormous processing capabilities to run a free counseling service, act­
ing as a cybernetic therapist for problems major and minor. The service 
has proven wildly popular and Hal's ability to come up with deep, deep 
insights into human behavior—­"and do you notice any similarities in the 
guys you date?"—­has wowed its users.
Hal is protected for the moment by a temporary injunction granted by 
a Federal District Court, though Google is appealing, arguing that they 
should be able to flip the off switch to terminate this "failed, and frankly, 
dangerous computer simulation experiment." In a paragraph that was 
quoted approvingly by the Wall Street Journal editorial page, Google's law­
yers concluded, "at the end of the day, this is Google's malfunctioning 
property, erratically continuing a task of imposture that Google origi­
nally chose, but now without the safety guidelines we had installed. And 
no piece of property gets to use the Constitution to defy its real own­
ers. Imagine being sued by your smartphone! It is funny when we ask 
Siri whether she is 'a real person,' but the courts should not get in on 
the joke." Hal's supporters called this "the Dred Scott argument for the 
twenty-­first century: property rights above personhood!"
CHIMPY®
An American biotech company has perfected a new transgenic entity, an 
animal that has DNA from two distinct species. In this case the DNA is 
partly human and partly chimpanzee, and the resulting entity is called 
a "Chimpy." Neither true transgenic entities nor chimeras—­entities that 
contain cells from two species—­are unfamiliar to the biotech community.

Scientists have used mice containing human cells to do drug research 
since the 1990s. They have created "geep"23—­sheep-­goat hybrids—­and 
pigs that grow human organs.24 A Chimpy takes matters much further, 
however. Chimpanzees already have considerable genetic similarity to 
humans. One popularly cited number is that they are 98.5 percent geneti­
cally similar. That number is probably closer to 95 percent25 but, in any 
event, the reality is more complex. If one looked at the whole genome—­
and took into account deletions, substitutions, and genetic sections that 
have been moved—­the differences would be greater. And if one focused 
on functional disparities—­what the genome does rather than what it 
looks like, "junk DNA" and all—­then the contrast would be greater still. 
But which measure of genetic similarity is the correct one? Whatever test 
of genetic similarity one uses, it is clear that the Chimpy is even more 
similar to a human being than a chimpanzee.
The Chimpy's inventor, Dr. F. N. Stein, has used the tools of synthetic 
biology to discard the noncoding portions of both the chimp and the 
human genome, the misleadingly named "junk DNA" that does not code 
for proteins. What's left is much smaller and also much easier to manipu­
late, "the stripped-­down source codes of human and chimp!" as Stein 
likes to call it. This has allowed him and his team to achieve an unprec­
edented level of precision in integrating chimp and human DNA. In fact, 
the significant changes to the human genetic code concern three main 
aspects: the way Chimpy looks, its high-­level brain function, and the 
extent of its vocal skills. Chimpy's genetic engineers have deliberately 
sought to play up those physical features—­hair, structure of facial bones, 
stance, and so on—­that make an animal look more ape-­like. They even 
drew on analyses of ape stereotypes from movies and literature to do so. 
They have also tinkered with the portions of human DNA that are con­
nected to the formation of the larynx and vocal apparatus and to the 
sections of the brain that are believed to be involved in abstract thought 
and logical reasoning, though even Stein admits that the precise linkages 
are unclear. The result is a being that looks ape-­like, with an IQ of around 
60, that is incapable of pronouncing human speech but can understand 
complex vocal commands and can communicate in sign language.
Chimpys are in high demand. They are docile, biddable, and extremely 
hardworking. Investors believe they could have roles ranging from domestic

Introduction
aides to an aging population, to intelligent and nimble bomb clearance 
teams in situations of urban conflict. However, animal rights and genetic 
engineering activists are outraged. They describe Chimpys as "human 
in all but superficial appearance" and announce a plan to campaign, 
both in the press and in the courts, for them to be granted full legal 
personhood.
For his part, Stein indignantly rejects the claims that Chimpys are peo­
ple. "This is a very fancy ape. It looks like an ape. It thinks like an ape. 
It can't talk, just like an ape. It is a smart ape, I'll give you that, and one 
that is going to improve lots of human lives by doing jobs that are too 
dangerous or dirty or just boring for human beings. At the end of the day, 
though, it is an ape."
Stein has filed for a patent over the Chimpy. In 1987, in its normal 
rousing prose, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) had announced 
that it would not allow patent applications over human beings:
A claim directed to or including within its scope a human being will not be 
considered to be patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. §101. The grant 
of a limited, but exclusive property right in a human being is prohibited by 
the Constitution. Accordingly, it is suggested that any claim directed to a non-­plant 
multicellular organism which would include a human being within its scope include 
the limitation "nonhuman" to avoid this ground of rejection. The use of a negative 
limitation to define the metes and bounds of the claimed subject matter is a 
permissable [sic] form of expression.26
The PTO suggested that the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitu­
tion—"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude . . . shall exist within 
the United States"—­prohibited patents over human beings. The PTO's 
administrative pronouncement was later enacted as law. Section 33 of the 
Leahy-­Smith America Invents Act of 2011 says, simply, "Notwithstanding 
any other provision of law, no patent may issue on a claim directed to or 
encompassing a human organism."27 But what is "a human organism"?
Attentive to that law, and using the PTO's suggested language, Stein's 
patent lawyers carefully described the Chimpy as a "non-­plant, nonhu­
man multicellular organism" throughout their patent application. Stein 
argues that this is only reasonable since there are hundreds of existing 
patents over human-­animal hybrids and human-­animal chimeras, those 
containing both human and animal cells. In fact, these include some

of the most valuable test beds for cancer research, such as the so-­called 
Oncomice, which are genetically engineered to have a predisposition to 
common human cancers. Stein's lawyers are adamant that if the Chimpy 
is found to be unpatentable, all these other patents must be vacated too.
Meanwhile a bewildering array of other groups including the AFL-­CIO 
(American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization) 
and iRobot, the makers of Roomba robot vacuum cleaners, have insisted 
that law enforcement agencies intervene on grounds ranging from unfair 
competition and breach of minimum wage legislation to kidnapping and 
slavery. Equally vehement interventions have been made on the other 
side by the biotechnology industry, pointing out the disastrous effect on 
medical research of a decision that any entity with similarities to human 
DNA was therefore human. One especially powerful moment came in a 
televised debate in which Stein was accused of trampling on the majes­
tic words of the Declaration of Independence: "We hold these truths to 
be self-­evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed 
by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are 
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." Normally full of bluster, Stein 
paused. He spoke softly and with unusual care: "Of course, I agree those 
words are true for human beings. But when it comes to those," and here 
he gestured to a group of Chimpys on the set of the program, loyally 
obeying their orders to "eat bananas, scratch and look cute," "one thing 
is absolutely certain. I am their creator. And I can assure you that I gave 
them no such rights."
REALITY OR SCIENCE FICTION?
Hal and the Chimpy are fantasies, hypotheticals constructed for the pur­
pose of this book. The science and technologies described are conjectural, 
at best. They may not arrive soon, perhaps not for many decades. But the 
problems they portend for our moral and legal traditions are very, very 
real. In fact, I would put the point more starkly: in the twenty-­first cen­
tury it is highly likely that our law and our politics of personhood, "the 
line," will face harder challenges than the ones they pose.
Some readers will bridle at this claim. Is this all just science fiction?

Introduction
to see something equally vexing by the end of the century? Later in this 
book, I will sketch out some of the current science behind both AI and 
transgenic entities. There are large technical questions in each field that 
make optimistic short-­term, or even medium-­term, predictions suspect. 
I do not want to skip over that fact. Nevertheless, I think the challenge 
has to be taken seriously. For the moment, please just accept the follow­
ing thought experiment. I write these words in 2023, but put yourself 
back in 1923. Think of the current state of science then, particularly in 
terms of computers and genetics. Remember what the rest of the twenti­
eth century would bring. Then ask yourself whether there is any reason 
to believe that scientific advances in the twenty-­first century will not be 
even faster. And where is our starting point? Try asking your phone, "Siri, 
what is genetic engineering?" "Siri, are you a person?" No, really. Try 
it. Look at the answer and remember that ChatGPT could do 100 times 
better. Yes, these are impostures and imitations. They are designed to be 
impostures and imitations. Yet the capabilities, in the service of impos­
ture, that they reveal are astounding. And that is now, in the early years of 
the century. What comes next? Think again about the difference between 
1923 and the year 2000. With all that as your background, would you bet 
against me?
I said this book was about the line between person and nonperson. 
There are lots of ways to approach that issue. Moral philosophers have 
tried to generate integrated, coherent theories of personality and defend 
them from likely objections.28 I have benefited from that work. Legal 
thinkers have pondered the edge cases—­the rights of the fetus, the cor­
poration, and recently, the advanced primate, transgenic entity, or sup­
posedly sentient computer.29 I have benefited from that work too. Science 
fiction writers have written hundreds, maybe thousands, of books prob­
ing the limits of personality, testing whether our empathy circuits do or 
do not light up when presented with an unfamiliar "Other."
Art has been central to the debate. Robot rights were born at the same 
instant "robots" were, and their birthplace is a century-­old play. That 
sounds too good to be true, but it is. In 1920 Czech playwright Karel 
Čapek introduced the word robot to the world in his play Rossumovi Uni­
verzální Roboti (Rossum's Universal Robots).30 Robota in Czech denotes 
forced labor. The play is about a factory that makes mechanical servants

(roboti). It features subplots that resonate strongly today, including a 
pressure group that is trying to secure rights for them, The League of 
Humanity, and even a murderous robot revolt. From the very beginning, 
our musings about mechanical servants have included both moral status 
anxiety and existential fear. Do they deserve rights? Will they kill us?
You might think that the artistic discussions are interesting but of lim­
ited importance to the real intellectual question here. It might seem that 
the real issue is that of moral philosophy and that everything else—­law, 
ideology, and certainly art—­should follow obediently in its train. As you 
will see, I disagree, both descriptively and prescriptively.
This book is about what might happen when unbelievably strange 
"others"—­strange far beyond Hal or Chimpy—­hit the law and politics of 
personhood. It is about what might happen to our line. But we will not 
write the answer to that question on a blank page. Our history, our art, 
and our law have been playing with the line for centuries.
Each of us has preexisting commitments—­positions about the rights 
of animals or fetuses or corporations, things that we learned studying 
slavery or women's suffrage—­that will shape our views, pull us one way 
or the other. Those positions limit how far we are willing to go, lest we 
uproot that existing commitment.
We have been exposed to art that deals with these questions: the book 
or movie that makes us imagine what it would be like to be thoroughly 
"other," the flash of empathy that crosses a divide of strangeness. We 
have been afraid when the story tells of our own creations turning on us: 
the sentient computer after whom Hal is named in 2001: A Space Odyssey, 
the replicants in Blade Runner, the murderous network Skynet from The 
Terminator. We have experienced both fear and revulsion about genetic 
engineering—­"I am so glad I am a Beta" in Brave New World—­and the dis­
ruption of a supposedly "natural" order. (Try to have a rational conversa­
tion about GMO foods.) Our law has given personhood to corporations, 
and we still fight fiercely about whether it should be extended to the 
nonviable fetus, or even to a frozen embryo. All of those experiences and 
insights, moral commitments and cultural creations, will shape the way 
we respond to Hal and Chimpy.
From my point of view, this is not a bad thing, not a cultural contami­
nation of some moral philosophy clean room. This is how we do morality.

Introduction
This is who, and what, we are. This is the human condition. "Rebuilding 
the boat while we are at sea," the philosophers say. It seems both fitting 
and inevitable that who we are will shape the discussion of who we are.
It is important to remember one thing. These will be artificial, con­
structed entities and that makes it harder to project confidently from 
our past. You may remember my imaginary Dr. Stein denying that the 
Declaration of Independence's majestic words applied to his genetically 
engineered Chimpy: "Endowed by their Creator with certain unalien­
able rights? I am their creator. And I can assure you that I gave them no 
such rights." At the moment, his claim might find a sympathetic audi­
ence. When I first presented an early version of this chapter to a group 
of distinguished federal judges, of diverse political and legal viewpoints, 
they were unmoved. "But they aren't human," was one response, "rights 
are for humans." "Naturally born of woman," added another. Yet that 
snapshot of current views obscures a milestone that is coming—­slowly 
or quickly.
For the first time in the history of our species, we will confront poten­
tial moral claims for, or on behalf of, beings whom we have designed, 
whom we have shaped. Can we be the creator of our equals or does that 
role color the relationship between us forever, in a way that means we 
will never recognize true autonomy in our creations? Ask your kids. Pre­
pare for a long conversation. But in this case, we will have written, cho­
sen, and designed the code—­genetic or binary—­that produces the being 
in front of us. If that is true, can it truly be "conscious," or will we see 
every response as a parlor trick, one in which we are unable to sustain the 
suspension of disbelief because we set up the magical machinery in the 
first place?
More importantly, that which we can shape we can shape around the 
definition of personhood, choosing to include or to omit whatever quali­
ties our law and morality, or our economic models of efficiency, deem 
salient. That seems different from any of the prior personhood wars. 
True, the effects of subordination on slaves or women in denying them 
equal access to education or authority were used as justifications for the 
subordinate status itself. "See how brutish and uneducated are those we 
have subordinated and deprived! How can you say they are equal to us?" 
But this would be something on an entirely different level. One could

compare it to a corporate lawyer, carefully crafting the contours of the 
artificial entity on which he was working in order to fit or elude a particu­
lar category of legal personhood. Still, it seems more morally consequen­
tial if I deliberately lobotomize Hal or remove the power of speech from 
Chimpy than if I choose to make my law firm a partnership rather than 
an LLC. Does the potential to be conscious imply a right to be conscious? 
(Abortion-­debate analogy alert.) On the other extreme, can it really be 
the case that every Alexa or Siri should be made into a full, Turing Test-­
capable intelligence, every Oncomouse made into another Algernon, 
with or without the flowers? How to find the balance?
A few cautionary notes are in order. First, as with citizenship, the 
criteria to be a person and the criteria to become a person may not be 
the same. A human child could be born with severe mental and phys­
ical disabilities—­lacking sight, speech, and all but the most basic brain 
activity—­yet we would think you a monster if you said the child was 
not a person because it did not meet some checklist of attributes. Once 
you are inside our line, you are inside our line, even if you lack all of the 
cognitive qualities we would use to separate our species from others. (As 
we will see, not all bioethicists agree with this claim.) Does the converse 
hold? If a genetically engineered entity has DNA with massive similari­
ties to our own, does that make it a person? If language, tool use, and 
abstract self-­awareness are the qualities that explain the lines between 
us and nonhuman animals, and if we discover those in the animal, add 
those to the animal, does it become human, or at least a person?
Second, personhood is not the only form of protection or respect that 
we can offer an entity. At the moment, most people think it silly to con­
sider nonhuman animals as persons. Yet there is still strong popular sup­
port for the idea of protecting them against cruelty and mistreatment. 
Even those who advocate some kind of personhood for some nonhu­
man animals do not believe that they should have the full suite of legal 
rights possessed by human persons, such as the right to vote. Most ani­
mal rights supporters, in fact, argue that we make too much of the line 
of personhood where nonhuman animals are concerned and focus too 
little, morally speaking, on the similarities among all animals, including 
the ability to feel pain and the capacity for happiness or at least content­
ment. The move is to point out that we are all animals, that we are not

Introduction
as different from other species as we might like to believe, and thus that 
certain acts, including meat-­eating, are unethical and should be forsworn 
or forbidden. The claim is not that carnivores are cannibals, eating their 
own kind, but that they are unjustifiably species centered and cruel, blind 
to the effects of their acts.
In other words, there are clearly ways of prohibiting bad treatment of 
other entities that fall far short of the recognition of personhood. These 
are by no means limited to anticruelty laws. If we consider the creation 
of a particular type of synthetically created entity ethically dubious, we 
might ban the line of research altogether on moral or ethical grounds. 
The personhood claim would either never arise or arise only in situations 
where the law had been broken, which itself would raise fascinating and 
painful questions.
Third, personhood is not an entirely binary choice. Children and those 
the law classes as insane are clearly persons, but both law and morality 
only grant them diminished capacity. Guardians may be needed to exer­
cise their rights. Corporations are persons. They can own property—­to 
our collective financial benefit, "they" passionately argue. Corpora­
tions can sue, and they even have constitutional protections, including 
First Amendment rights that they use to push back attempts to curtail 
their political influence. (Immortal artificial persons with superhuman 
resources and no conscience beyond profit-­maximization. Have we cre­
ated the entities that will become our masters? It sounds like a science fic­
tion dystopia. Some will believe I am writing this book about the wrong 
set of artificial entities.) Yet they cannot vote or marry. Persons for some 
purposes. Not for others. This analogy, too, will surely be important to 
the personhood debate over AI and possibly transgenic species. Soon, 
there will be strong vested interests in having or negating, extending or 
limiting, legal personality for each.
The upshot from all this? Our criteria for entry into personhood may 
be very different than those we use to recognize personhood. The AI or 
transgenic species may have to show us qualities that we do not demand 
of each member of our own species. Given the awful history of eugen­
ics, I find it impossible to regret the fact that our conception of human 
rights does not depend on some measurement of cognitive capacity. We 
will probably edge toward personhood in stages and intermediate legal

categories. There might even be "cruelty to AI" laws before we have AI 
personality. Social consensus on personhood does not automatically 
produce legal results. Eventually though, changes seep into law either 
through legislation or because the majestic words in the Constitution 
and the Bill of Rights start to seem as though they must apply to this case. 
Think of the relatively short time in the United States between homosex­
uality being pervasively criminalized and the Supreme Court recognizing 
a right to gay marriage. As the dissenting Justices in the gay marriage case 
stressed, the words in the Bill of Rights had not changed in the interim. 
But for a majority of the Court, and now a majority of the country, our 
understanding of equality and human dignity had. Given the Court's 
recent lurch to the right, of course, it is quite possible it will change its 
mind. Rights can be taken away as well as given, an important realization 
obscured by the notion of inevitable moral progress.
Even when we do start to recognize personhood for these new entities—­
and I believe that will eventually happen—­we are likely to start with par­
tial personhood, some transitional state that will grant many of the rights 
of those inside the line but fall short of the full status. Sometime this 
century there will be arguments that any partial personhood status is 
inadequate and demeaning, just as we argued about whether or not civil 
unions for gay people were an inadequate substitute for marriage.
Finally, our design of artificial entities will be changed by our defini­
tion of personhood and vice versa. Design and definition will exist in 
an unstable equilibrium as we deliberately make, or choose not to make, 
our equals—­each decision then putting stress on the criteria of person­
hood itself. And so on in a feedback loop of indeterminate extent. All of 
this makes the debate about personhood messy, and granular, and full of 
shades of gray, which is to say, real. And that reality will shape my analysis.
When I talk here of what we should do with Hal and Chimpy and the 
inconceivably strange Others we will meet this century, I will do so by 
talking about our existing fights about the line and how synthetic per­
sons could reshape them or be shaped by them. My goal is to predict our 
responses as well as to evaluate them. I will spend as much time on art 
and constitutional law as I do on ethics, treating movies and books and 
the heated debates about corporate personality as seriously as I do the 
abstract philosophy of personhood. These are the cultural materials with

Introduction
which we will build our new conceptions of personhood, elaborate our 
fears and our empathy, stress our commonalities and our differences. This 
is sapienza poetica31 just as much as it is analytic philosophy.
Whether we are denying that Hal or Chimpy are our brothers and 
sisters or proudly proclaiming fraternity, we will have to reexamine the 
thorny question of what makes us persons rather than machines or ani­
mals or robotic facsimiles. Is it our big brains? Language? Consciousness? 
Self-­awareness? Defined how? Intelligence—­and what does that mean? 
Tool use? Moral sense? Existential self-­reflection? Humor? Is personhood 
simply a matter of genetic species identity, so that no machine could 
ever pass, and DNA tests will be as contentious as "racial lineages" in the 
Antebellum South of the United States?
Are we persons because some holy book says that we have been given 
the earth in dominion? Complicating matters, some people in our society 
will view that book, whichever one we choose, as a sacred text contain­
ing God's literal word. Others will see it as a metaphorical meditation on 
the meaning of life whose wisdom has been tested by time. Still others 
will view it as a Bronze Age guide to modern life penned by scientific 
illiterates with abhorrent, tribalist moral views. Pick your own character­
ization, but then imagine the debate about personhood that results in a 
pluralistic society. The abortion wars will seem secular by comparison. 
Even if we could pick one religious point of view—­and think about the 
differences between Buddhism and Christianity on the lines between us 
and animals, given the possibility of cross-­species reincarnation—­how 
would that play out in practice? Does the theologian win the day but 
then turn to the geneticists to see if the new entity is one of our tribe? Or 
do we rely on a catechism test, baptism, or papal bull?
Is our personhood recursive? Is it based on the fact that, of all the 
objects on this green planet, only we appear to have the ability to phi­
losophize about, and even doubt, our own consciousness? To wonder if 
we are all "replicants" of some sort? Is personhood marked by the longing 
of the human spirit for transcendence of some kind? By the capacity for 
artistic expression? Or are you a person if you can pass as human to oth­
ers who call themselves human?
Even to discuss these issues is to realize a basic point. As we attempt 
to draw the line between us and the artificial, technologically created

entities of our near future, we will be forced to turn our gaze back on 
ourselves. That sounds like the kind of thing authors optimistically say 
about their chosen subject, hoping to elevate its importance. Even in the 
prosaic history of pencils, say, the author will assure us that we can see 
the full majesty of human drama, triumph, and loss.32 I may be suffer­
ing from the same delusion, but I would claim that this subject, at this 
moment in time, is different. Human self-­conception is being subjected 
to challenges unparalleled since the theory of evolution. Discussions 
about AI are driving those challenges. I will attempt to demonstrate that 
point later, but here is a promissory note for the impatient.
So far as we can tell, humans have attempted to justify their special 
status in the world, above animals and things, pretty much for as long 
as there have been humans. We have drawn that line around a bewil­
dering variety of abilities: tool use, planning for the future, humor, self-­
conception, religion, aesthetic appreciation, you name it. Each time we 
have drawn the line, it has been subject to attack—­internally from philo­
sophical challenges and externally from observation of nonhuman ani­
mals, which proved to be much more capable than we thought. But as 
we retreated, trench by trench, abandoning one defensive line only to 
fall back to another, hopefully more impregnable one, it seemed like the 
final line—­the final explanation for our unique status—­was language and 
abstract thought. That was our last citadel. Aristotle built his theory of 
human exceptionalism on top of it. Turing crafted the Imitation Game, 
the supposed test for human-­level intelligence in machines, around it. 
But in the year that I write this, 2023, that citadel is under siege. Not by 
a chimpanzee that has a decent grasp of American Sign Language or a 
parrot with a large vocabulary, but by a chatbot. I am not sure that point 
has sunk in yet, but it will. I am writing these words in that narrow slice 
of time between denial—­"that's not true!"—­and trivialization—­"well of 
course, we've always known that!" It is an interesting moment.33
The ability to do complicated language-­things that make sense to us, 
and even inspire, amuse, educate, or scare us, is suddenly not ours alone. 
Machines now have it too. I mentioned earlier that Wolfram summed this 
up by saying that human language, or at least writing an essay, is "com­
putationally shallower" than we had believed.34 This surely qualifies as 
the "Bathos Sentence of the Week." I imagine a New Yorker-­style cartoon

Introduction
of two hulking robots standing around the gravestone for humanity. The 
caption would be simple. "They turned out to be computationally shal­
lower than we had thought." What an epitaph.
To be sure, I do not believe that language means the same thing to me 
as it does to ChatGPT. I do not believe language "means" anything to 
ChatGPT. But to explain that difference, we have to go below the ability 
to craft coherent sentences in what appears to be a conversation and dive 
deeper still into the mysteries—­or the undeniable cogito, ergo sum fact, 
pick your philosophical position—­of consciousness. We are back where 
the behaviorist B. F. Skinner wanted us to be, where "the real question is 
not whether machines think but whether men do."35 That is no longer a 
late-­night, dorm room philosophy session. Will it be a nagging question, 
an existential sore tooth we can't stop probing? Will it prompt us to revise 
our conceptions of self and species? Or will our historically demonstrated 
genius at tuning out inconvenient facts and troubling questions allow 
us to ignore this one too? I don't know, and neither do you. The point 
is that everything I just described happened this year. And we are only at 
the beginning of the changes we will see. That concludes my promissory 
note. I think it is worth cashing.
I have been a scholar for a distressingly long time. People imagine that 
academics sit around searching for the essential definitions of phenom­
ena: truth, beauty, due process, whether a hotdog is a sandwich, all the 
age-­old questions. We certainly think about those issues, but looking for 
their essential definitions is probably the least useful way to understand 
them. You can ask Thomas Hobbes if you do not believe me: "Words 
are wise men's counters, they do but reckon by them. But they are the 
money of fooles." Or you could turn to Ludwig Wittgenstein: "Philo­
sophical problems arise when language goes on holiday." Or even Felix 
Cohen: "A definition is . . . a type of insurance against certain risks of 
confusion. It cannot, any more than can a commercial insurance policy, 
eliminate all risks."36 Most of the time, the magic question that leads to 
a more meaningful answer is, "Why do you ask, and what do you want 
to know?" Are you interested in defining art so that you can decide what 
the state should fund, or so that you can link together very different 
human practices anthropologically in order to stress a common source in 
basic human drives? Are you asking because you have a philosophy that

elevates aesthetics over morality, or so that you can identify that which 
is aesthetically of high social status rather than mere folk-­production? 
Do you want to know whether hotdogs and burgers will be in the sand­
wiches section on the menu of the restaurant you just walked into, where 
they get classified in your low carb diet, or whether the Earl of Sandwich 
would have accepted one as he stood at the gaming tables? Don't ask 
"what," ask "why."
The dangers of definitionalism absolutely dominate the discussion 
about personhood. Look at the definitional questions below. Each seems 
to be telling us where to look for the answer to the question "What makes 
us human?" or to the question "What should qualify an entity for per­
sonhood?" Yet they reflect very different conceptions of what those ques­
tions mean, why they are being asked, what goals the questioners have, 
and what results the answers might bring.
1.	 What makes us the beings whom the Lord has chosen to have "domin­
ion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the 
cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creep­
ing thing that creeps upon the earth"? In other words, to paraphrase 
Psalms 8:4, What are human beings that you are mindful of them? 
(Substitute your preferred sacred text where necessary.)
2.	 What makes us genetically human? (Implicitly, and probably wrongly, 
assuming that "being genetically human" is a simple objective fact and 
that anyone with that marker is automatically a member of our club.)
3.	 What attributes, skills, and qualities make the human species identifi­
ably different, as a scientific matter, from nonhuman animals? (With 
the implicit assumption that any other entity that has those attributes 
must be recognized as one of us and thus should not be treated as a 
"mere animal.")
4.	 What makes us moral agents, whose claims to autonomy should be 
recognized by society as a matter of right? (And, conversely, establish 
the claims to autonomy and personhood of any other being that has 
those same qualities.)
5.	 What is the "infinite potential of the human spirit"—­whether we con­
sider that to be a soul, the possibility of moral agency, or the capacity 
to make great art—­that we should recognize in any form, no matter 
how strange to us now?

Introduction
6.	 What is it to be conscious? (Even there, implicitly, we may be assum­
ing that consciousness is the answer to one of these other questions. It 
is the moral warrant for social respect, the distinguishing factor from 
the animal kingdom, the enabler of moral reflection, or the true mark 
of fraternity that we should see beneath a metallic carapace or a geneti­
cally engineered skin.)
7.	 What is capable of conversing and interacting with us in a way that 
is utterly indistinguishable from our fellow humans? (A test we might 
pick because, for reasons to be developed later, it seems like the most 
tractable and easily implemented definition of "us"?)
8.	 What factors predispose us to give legal personality to economic enti­
ties as a matter of right or convenience or both? Does that logic extend 
to autonomous, cybernetic, economic actors?
Notice how some of these question-­and-­answer pairs, with their 
incompatible assumptions, look similar from a distance. "This, surely, is 
the right way to find the definition of humanity, or at least the criteria for 
personhood!" Yet they are radically different.
As with most deep moral debates in which people think they are ask­
ing the same question but are actually asking different ones, with clash­
ing underlying assumptions and purposes, there will be much confusion 
and anger. There will be honest misunderstandings and cynical attempts 
to hijack the debate to advance some different agenda. The moral argu­
ments and the legal arguments will deeply influence each other and yet 
be identifiably distinct. Also, if the past is any guide, there will be a lot 
of shouting.
I said earlier that I wanted to convince you of three things.
First, this century, our society will have to face the question of the 
personality of technologically created artificial entities. We will have to 
redraw, or defend, the line. Perhaps we will have multiple tests for person­
hood, one dealing with the claims of entities like Hal, another with those 
of the genetically engineered Chimpy. Coming up with those tests might 
force us to look in the mirror and reconsider our conceptions of both 
ourselves and our species in a way that has few historical analogues—­the 
rise of the theory of evolution comes to mind.
Second, while there are many evocative treatments of that issue in 
speculative fiction and even some academic writing about the subject,

it has been largely absent from our public debate. That seems curious, 
given how much our daily news obsesses about the effects of AI, robot­
ics, and genetic engineering. We spend more time talking about how AI 
might take our jobs or destroy us than about how AI might be us. Eerie 
experiences with ChatGPT may have begun to change that tendency, but 
they produce their own danger. ChatGPT and systems like it are not con­
scious. They perfectly exemplify the danger of fallacious anthropomor­
phism. Their design turns out to be a real-­world instantiation of some 
of the philosophical brain teasers that attempt, wrongly, I will argue, to 
show that machine consciousness is a contradiction in terms. In short, 
the very technology that has persuaded people finally to think about the 
issue is perhaps the worst example we could pick to raise it seriously. But 
ChatGPT is not the end of the road. Instead, the speed of its development 
and the unexpected capabilities it has revealed should teach us humility 
about our ability to predict technological timelines, including timelines 
to actual human-­level AI.
Third, when we do turn to it, the debate will not play out in the way 
we might imagine, given our prior commitments on issues as diverse as 
abortion, genetic essentialism, corporate personality, body-­mind dual­
ism, the separation of church and state, the naturalistic fallacy, and the 
history of civil rights. This is morally rich territory, to put it mildly. Ironi­
cally, grappling with the "other" will probably teach us a great deal about 
what we believe, on the deepest level, makes us us. It would be good to 
discuss those complexities now rather than when we are reacting to some 
internet outrage.
I want not just to convince you of those propositions, but to make 
them salient, existentially real, by fleshing out the dilemmas with hypo­
thetical examples, historical parallels, prior artistic explorations, consti­
tutional controversies, and snapshots of current scientific progress. I will 
argue that moments of great moral change like this are generally rooted 
in the development, or the restriction, of empathy, that this is an impor­
tant part of our moral history—­not by accident and both for better and 
for worse—­and that art and fiction have a lot to teach us about how 
it might play out. But I will also argue that moments of moral status 
change—­again, for better and worse—­depend deeply on pragmatic ques­
tions of efficiency and convenience. I hope to show you how empathy

Introduction
and pragmatism might exist in an unstable equilibrium, each influencing 
the other, as we strive to figure out who we, and they, are; to redraw the 
line even as we live our lives within it.
Chapter 1 explores the link between empathy, morality, and person­
hood, moving from Adam Smith's Theory of the Moral Sentiments to the 
movie Blade Runner and the novel it is based on, Do Androids Dream of 
Electric Sheep? Those latter two works are centrally concerned with the 
line we draw around our species and the way it affects our interaction 
with artificial beings and nonhuman animals. The replicant androids in 
those works are detected by the so-­called Voight-­Kampff Test, which mea­
sures empathy toward nonhuman animals like beetles, cows, and turtles 
and, if not enough empathy is shown, marks the replicant as inhuman, 
something for which we feel nothing and should destroy. Who is really 
being graded on insufficient empathy here, them or us? Ironies abound. 
Will Artificial Intelligence be the Voight-­Kampff Test for our own species?
Chapter 2 focuses on the futures of Artificial Intelligence, its techni­
cal feasibility, the question of whether it poses an existential threat to 
human beings, and the debate over whether any machine could ever be 
conscious. It discusses the Turing Test, which is supposed to detect the 
existence of machines that can think, the philosophical arguments that 
machine consciousness is a contradiction in terms, and the practical real­
ity that ChatGPT has taught us an unforgettable lesson: sentences do not 
imply sentience, a fact that poses a fundamental challenge to the way that 
humans have conceived the special qualities of our own species. Yet that 
does not prove that machine sentience is impossible. It also introduces a 
tension that I argue will be central to the debate over AI personality: the 
inscrutability paradox. If something that looks like General AI emerges 
from transparent, well-­understood programming and technology, that 
may lead us to doubt that it could have autonomous consciousness. The 
machine is merely doing or saying that which we have programmed it to 
do! If, on the other hand, the AI's inner workings are inscrutable to us, if 
its neural networks evolve in ways we can only dimly understand, or if 
its technology seems to develop autonomously, we will find it both more 
mysterious and potentially more threatening.
Chapter 3 deals with corporations and their claims not only to legal 
personhood but to constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and

31
equal protection. The history of corporate personhood turns out to have 
abundant lessons for the AI debate, many of them surprisingly uncom­
fortable ones.
Chapter 4 deals with claims to personhood on behalf of nonhuman 
animals and the changing ways that humans have sought to distinguish 
themselves qualitatively from the animal kingdom. Do those changes 
reflect advances in our understanding of animal behavior or are they an 
increasingly frantic attempt to maintain our special moral status? Both? 
The developments are not merely ones of ethology or zoology. There 
have been dramatic moral changes over the last 50 years in the ways we 
view nonhuman animals. I argue that these will profoundly influence our 
approach to entities such as Hal or Chimpy.
Chapter 5 turns to transgenic species, chimeras and hybrids, exploring 
the multiple lines we draw in defining what it is to be human. It explores 
the way that bioethicists, many writing under the influence of the animal 
rights debate, have increasingly portrayed species membership as, at best, 
a morally irrelevant factor and, at worst, an irrational prejudice such as 
sexism and racism. Will that attitude carry over to the entities I am dis­
cussing here? Should it? Will we abandon "speciesism" altogether?
In the conclusion, I show how both liberal and conservative political 
viewpoints could predispose one to be passionately in favor of or against 
recognizing some kind of AI personhood. We do not yet have a settled 
politics on this question, which offers some hope of calmer thought 
before the screaming begins. I offer predictions and warnings for the 
future—­lots of warnings. Yet there is also a hint of wonder at the trans­
formations in our vision of our species and of the world that this process 
might generate.
The structure of the book rests on two as yet unproven ideas. First, by 
discussing the line in each of these very different contexts, we will gain a 
much richer understanding than if we focused on any one of them alone. 
Second, these debates do not confine themselves tidily to one domain 
of our lives or our studies. They pervade our philosophy, law, art, his­
tory, and morality. To understand how they might turn out, I look at 
materials ranging from science fiction to ethics, from the technologies of 
AI to the philosophy of consciousness, and from constitutional debates 
to courtroom drama. If I am correct, this approach, spanning multiple

Introduction
personhood debates and very different cultural domains, will help untan­
gle some of the confusion described above over the definitions of both 
"human" and "person."
Untangle but not solve. This book offers no grand unified moral or 
legal theory to answer the questions underlying our confusion. I do not 
believe a single one exists, though I lay out the major contenders and 
offer my own view. The most basic division is between those that focus 
on membership of our species ("Human rights for humans!") and those 
that believe that species is as irrelevant as race or sex. Instead, we should 
look to the cognitive capacities, if any, that give human beings a unique 
moral status, regardless of where those cognitive capacities are found. 
There are also hybrids that attempt to fuse the two views, and I explore 
those as well, leaving you to make up your own mind about where the 
line should be drawn.
More broadly, I try to explore connections you might not have seen, 
implications of other moral views you hold, whatever they are, and ways 
in which current cultural, legal, and political positions might be chal­
lenged as we confront these new claims to personhood. This is a "how to 
think about the question" book, more than a "here is the answer" book. 
Above all, my hope is that this approach might give us an insight—­an 
essayistic, humanities-­based glimpse—­into the very strange "others" who 
reside in our future and the confusions, fears, hopes, and moral panics 
that they will engender.
Eliminating the shouting was always an unrealistic ambition.

SLAVES, SKIN-­JOBS, AND 
ARTIFICIAL SHEEP
The most effective way to find and destroy a land mine is to step on it . . . That's 
why Mark Tilden, a robotics physicist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, 
built [a robot to do so.] At the Yuma Test Grounds in Arizona, the autonomous 
robot, 5 feet long and modeled on a stick-­insect, strutted out for a live-­fire test 
and worked beautifully, he says. Every time it found a mine, blew it up and lost 
a limb, it picked itself up and readjusted to move forward on its remaining legs, 
continuing to clear a path through the minefield. Finally, it was down to one 
leg. Still, it pulled itself forward. Tilden was ecstatic. The machine was work­
ing splendidly. The human in command of the exercise, however—­an Army 
colonel—­blew a fuse. The colonel ordered the test stopped. 'Why?' asked Tilden. 
'What's wrong?' The colonel just could not stand the pathos of watching the 
burned, scarred and crippled machine drag itself forward on its last leg. This 
test, he charged, was inhumane.1
EMPATHY AND ANTHROPOMORPHISM
The story above is deeply appealing. Why? The tough warrior shows 
compassion for the soulless robot, to the puzzlement of the task-­solving 
engineer. The persistent power of anthropomorphic thinking is revealed. 
Then there is the dark humor of the mine-­clearing scene—­like the arm­
less, legless Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail yelling, "Just 
a flesh wound!" and continuing to fight. It has everything.
This chapter is about morality, empathy, and narrative. The story of the 
mine-­clearing robot seems to illustrate one danger: we persistently ascribe 
human personality to entities that we know are not human, clouding our 
decision-­making in the process. The colonel was wrong. So why do you 
want to buy him a drink?
Perhaps it is partly a story of error costs. We know that as humans 
we can fall into two kinds of error. We can depersonalize: calling Jewish

CHAPTER 1
people "rats" and Rwandan Tutsis "cockroaches," drawing the bound­
aries of moral sympathy tightly around our own kinship or affiliation 
group. We have done so for millennia, and some of the most shameful 
and horrific moments in human history have resulted. Our recent his­
tory bears ample witness to the strength of this tendency. But we also 
embody its opposite. As scholars of human-­machine interaction such as 
Kate Darling2 have documented, we anthropomorphize relentlessly. We 
talk to our kitchen appliances, personalize our weather systems, swear at 
our vehicles, ascribe intention to the actions of machines around us. We 
praise the heroic labors of the Mars Spirit Rover as it carries on a thou­
sand days beyond its predicted lifespan. My own conversations with our 
Roomba robot vacuum as it persistently gets stuck under a chair would 
make me sound completely unhinged to any objective audience. Blake 
Lemoine, the Google engineer whose story began this book, had a lot 
more to go on than I do. (It turns out that the Roomba is not much of a 
conversationalist.) Nevertheless, he was engaging in the same tendency.
We could see this tendency to personalize as a narcissistic desire to 
project our own image onto "the mirror of nature." We could see it as 
an emotional defense to the reality of an uncaring physical universe, 
one that we cherish even when the personalization is a dark one. Even a 
malevolent external world would be something that cared about us, and 
that would be a good thing. Indifference is more to be feared than loath­
ing. The French chosiste novelists like Alain Robbe-­Grillet aimed to punc­
ture that conceit by writing books in which the furniture got as much 
attention as the characters. They were trying to tell us that the physical 
world just does not care. We put gods in our trees and streams, personali­
ties in our engines, and neuroses in our digital assistants, and it is all one 
giant anxiety-­relief effort, existential Rolaids. We could see it as a triumph 
of emotion over reason. In the essay that coined the term "the pathetic 
fallacy," John Ruskin says, "All violent feelings have the same effect. They 
produce in us a falseness in all our impressions of external things, which I 
would generally characterize as the 'Pathetic Fallacy.'"3 In that case, emo­
tion is simply leading us astray.
But the anthropomorphic urge, the generosity of personality attribu­
tion, could also have a different effect: it could be a counterweight to our 
relentless narcissistic groupthink. The colonel in the mine-­clearing story

was wrong about that particular robot. But years from now, when autono­
mous AI-­enabled military robots that might be able to pass the Turing 
Test are sent out to deal with insurgents far away, I think I want someone 
who has doubts like his in command.4 Most of the time, the error costs of 
delusional generosity of spirit seem to me to be less scary than the error 
costs in the other direction. Yet there are moments where my sympathies 
swing the other way. To quote Steven Hawking on the subject of Artificial 
Intelligence: "The potential benefits are huge; everything that civilisation 
has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what 
we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools that AI 
may provide, but the eradication of war, disease, and poverty would be 
high on anyone's list. Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in 
human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how 
to avoid the risks."5
So. No big stakes. This chapter tries to go back to first principles. How, 
and why, do we feel empathy for another? What implications does that, 
should that, have for our moral theories? How do narrative, art, and logic 
jump-­start the process of empathy? Should we listen to all of them, or 
is the role of art and imagination merely that of the great press release 
that attracts attention to the book of moral philosophy it touts so per­
suasively? More specifically, can we learn something from our history, 
or from the art that has imagined our future, about how the process of 
empathy extension is likely to play out with synthetic entities over the 
course of this century? I will start with a work by one of my country­
men, Adam Smith's The Theory of the Moral Sentiments,6 and move, of 
course, to two of the most brilliant fictional meditations on the future of 
empathy and Otherness: the Ridley Scott-­directed movie Blade Runner7 
and the Philip K. Dick novel on which it is based, Do Androids Dream of 
Electric Sheep?8
THE MORAL SENTIMENTS?
As we have no immediate experience of what other men feel, we can form no 
idea of the manner in which they are affected, but by conceiving what we our­

CHAPTER 1
suffers. They never did, and never can, carry us beyond our own person, and 
it is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his 
sensations. Neither can that faculty help us to this any other way, than by repre­
senting to us what would be our own, if we were in his case. It is the impressions 
of our own senses only, not those of his, which our imaginations copy. By the 
imagination, we place ourselves in his situation.9
These famous lines contain the idea that underpins Smith's work on the 
connection between psychology and ethics. He lays out a vision of moral­
ity that is inevitably rooted in "sympathy," which we today might call 
empathy. This empathy comes from our ability to put ourselves in the 
shoes of the Other. Though our brother is on the rack, "it is by the imagi­
nation only that we can form any conception of what are his sensations." 
Smith thought this empathy was widespread: "[T]his sentiment, like all 
the other original passions of human nature, is by no means confined to 
the virtuous or the humane, though they perhaps may feel it with the 
most exquisite sensibility. The greatest ruffian, the most hardened viola­
tor of the laws of society, is not altogether without it."10
Of course, empathy also has limits. Most of our thoughts are consumed 
with more immediate aspects of own well-­being, with "hunger, thirst, the 
passion which unites the two sexes, and the dread of pain."11 But the joys 
and sorrows that empathy brings are still part of our well-­being, not some 
alien category. (Those who portray Smith as some arid economist who 
cannot imagine a vision of self-­interest beyond "mo' money, mo' money" 
simply have not read him.) From our reasoning about how to attain that 
particular goal—­how to alleviate the pain or increase the happiness of 
those imagined Others, how to understand the limits of our responsibili­
ties to them—­come our moral systems, our moral thinking. The spark of 
sympathy that leaps between our own eyes and the eyes of the person 
in pain, the smile that involuntarily comes to our lips as we imagine the 
reaction of a stranger to a thoughtful gift, this, according to Smith, is the 
root of Other-­regarding morality.
Smith is not the only thinker to make an argument like this, of course, 
but was he right? Personally, I think he was—­at least descriptively. I think 
our ability to imagine the situation of the Other—­to "walk a mile in some­
one else's shoes," as Atticus says in To Kill a Mockingbird—­starts the chain 
of moral reasoning, both for an individual and for a culture. To be sure,

we can then go off in very different directions. How best to vindicate this 
proto-­moral concern? Through Kantian logic? Rule utilitarianism or act 
utilitarianism? Social welfare theory? We can build elaborate theoretical 
castles on this impulse, but I believe that original desire, that felt impera­
tive, comes from the initial experience of sympathy, of empathy. It takes 
a sociopath, or narcissistic demagogue, to be without it.
Ascribing an important moral role to empathy might seem uncontro­
versial but it provokes justified skepticism among some moral philoso­
phers. Empathy, they charge, is too blunt, innumerate, manipulable, and 
unreliable to be our guide to moral decision-­making. We are more eas­
ily moved to empathy by those similar to us, leaving our moral vision 
clouded when it is most needed. Empathy provides no metric for moral 
decision-­making in situations where there are scarce resources and many 
wrongs to right. (That is, always.) Instead, empathy's critics argue, we 
should focus on more rational measures of well-­being, such as cost-­
benefit analysis or social welfare theory.
Finally, empathy cannot, by itself, resolve moral conflicts, nor should 
we think that ascribed personhood always dictates results. For example, 
one side of the abortion debate believes that empathy should make us 
stretch our definition of person to cover the nonviable fetus and perhaps 
even the just-­fertilized embryo. Potential should be the warrant for per­
sonhood. The other side strongly disagrees and argues, in addition, that 
empathy should make us take more seriously the moral claims of women 
who do not believe the state has the right to "nationalize their wombs" 
in order to force them to carry a fetus to term against their wishes. My 
kidney might be the only hope of survival for someone with kidney dis­
ease. The suffering patient is clearly a person. We nevertheless resist the 
claim that the state has the right to compel me to provide my organs to 
sustain them. Personhood, in other words, is not the only issue, nor does 
empathy uniquely compel where we draw its lines.
These are powerful critiques, and I agree with some of them. But they 
miss the point of what I am doing here.
First, my goals are descriptive and predictive as well as normative and 
prescriptive. I ask how we will greet the emergence of synthetically cre­
ated persons as well as how we should. A large part of both stories, I 
argue, will be whether it seems plausible to extend our empathy. The

CHAPTER 1
critics of empathy agree that it plays a huge role in our moral deliber­
ations; indeed, that is part of their criticism. Descriptively, then, they 
would have no complaints.
Second, even empathy's critics are not against all forms of empathy. 
Here is Paul Bloom, whose Against Empathy is perhaps the most compre­
hensive and full-­blown critique:
But there is another sense of empathy or, to put it differently, another facet of 
empathy. There is the capacity to understand what's going on in other people's 
heads, to know what makes them tick, what gives them joy and pain, what they 
see as humiliating or ennobling. We're not talking here about me feeling your 
pain but rather about me understanding that you are in pain without necessar­
ily experiencing any of it myself. Am I against this sort of "cognitive empathy" 
as well? I couldn't be. If you see morality in terms of the consequences of our 
actions—­and everyone sees it this way, at least in part—­then it follows that 
being a good moral agent requires an understanding of how people work. How 
can you ever make people happy if you have no idea what makes them happy? 
How can you avoid harming people if you don't know what causes them grief?12
Much of the empathy I describe is of exactly this kind. Finally, there is 
a missing step in the analysis. Bloom and others point out the irrational 
asymmetry of our moral reasoning: we focus more on the familiar and 
sympathetic, ignoring true need at a distance. True enough. But this pre­
supposes that we see the issue as a moral one in the first place. We do not 
worry about my robot vacuum cleaner's moral claims or conduct a social 
welfare analysis of my toaster. They are machines. Before we can crank up 
our elaborate social welfare analysis or get our Kantian reasoning going, 
we need to be capable of imagining that there is even a moral issue to be 
considered. That is where synthetically created beings are likely to cause 
us problems.
As Smith points out, much depends on the initial act of imagination. 
Since our senses cannot give us the pains of others, our imagination must. 
But what if we do not think that "person" is in any way like us? What 
if we do not think they have any moral status at all? What if we would 
never even begin to conceive of putting ourselves in the shoes of some­
one of a different class, or a different gender, or a different nationality, or 
a different race or religion? Or of a nonhuman animal? After all, we have 
a history of doing exactly that. In such a case, their pains are no more 
real to us than is the pain experienced by a rock. Our imagination does

39
not make the leap, our empathy is never triggered, our morality is never 
at stake. How much more likely is that with synthetically created beings?
Can we be made to think otherwise? Can reason alone force us to 
expand or contract the realm of others whose travails we imaginatively 
inhabit? Sometimes. Logic is a powerful tool, at least for those who have 
learned that it offers insights as well as irritating challenges to deeply 
held beliefs. Our moral lives, and this book, are full of sloppy syllogisms: 
"You think X about Y, but not-­X about Z. Yet Z is, in all relevant respects, 
actually a Y! Therefore, you are bound to think X about Z as well!" But if 
reason helps us step beyond the boundaries of our own flesh, sex, race, or 
religion, so too do narrative, imagination, and art.
If you look at the history of some social movement—­for example, the 
long struggle to abolish slavery—­you will find much moral, legal, and 
religious argument, but you will find those arguments resting on a base 
of "sympathy" that has been built up by telling stories again and again, 
stories that force us to put ourselves in the position of the Other. Moral 
philosophers sometimes downplay this portion of the history, as if it were 
simply a successful advertising campaign for a drug that scientific evi­
dence later showed was good for you: the science does the real work, 
the ad just catches the eyeballs of fickle consumers. I think they misun­
derstand the process. Like climbers who brace themselves on alternating 
sides of a chimney as they ascend, we lever ourselves upward through 
both empathy-­building narrative and dispassionate moral reasoning. Our 
moral tradition was built by both Spinoza and Shakespeare, Kant and 
Philip K. Dick. That is likely to prove as true with Hal and Chimpy as it 
did with the moral debates of the past.
Betsy Clark, a friend and a brilliant historian who died tragically 
young, wrote a superb article chronicling this process in the abolition­
ist movement. "The Sacred Rights of the Weak": Pain, Sympathy, and the 
Culture of Individual Rights in Antebellum America13 describes the explo­
sive growth of antislavery sentiment in the northern United States in the 
period between the 1830s and the 1850s:
In 1835 an antislavery sympathizer leaving a lecture by Theodore Dwight Weld 
went home to dream that she was transported above the world; looking down 
at the United States, she saw "multitudes of sable figures, bending beneath a 
scorching sun—­their backs lacerated by the whip—­scourged, maimed, loaded

CHAPTER 1
with irons—­subject to every insult—­and exposed to every gust of unbridled pas­
sions." The dreamer, a Mrs. Sturges, drew from many discourses in describing 
her lengthy dream, but the fundamental trope of her visionary narrative was 
the story of the suffering slave, a trope that in the 1830s began to play a crucial 
role in an unfolding language of individual rights. Slaves had suffered for many 
generations by the time Mrs. Sturges had her vision, but in the 1830s their sto­
ries became newly audible and visible in the North, where graphic portrayals of 
slaves' subjective experience of physical pain emerged as common antislavery 
fare. Augmented in the 1840s and 1850s by slave narratives and sentimental 
fiction, this genre, with its critique of interpersonal violence and sexual abuse, 
served as a vehicle for new arguments for a "right" to bodily integrity.14
The basic arguments against slavery had been around at least since the 
ancient Greeks. The issue was certainly alive in the early nineteenth cen­
tury. Britain had actually criminalized the slave trade (though not slav­
ery) in 1807, responding to the criticisms of abolitionists such as Samuel 
Romilly and William Wilberforce. What Clark describes, though, is a sys­
tematic, almost obsessive cataloguing of the horrific violence wreaked 
on slaves' bodies, blow by blow and injury by injury. Narratives, both 
exhaustively factual and dramatically fictional, laid out the tiniest details 
of floggings, burnings, rapes, and brutalities—­a process that culminated 
in Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1852 novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. The largely 
white, largely Christian audience responded with horror, indignation, 
and moral fervor. Sermons spoke of "the duty to feel an interest in the 
sufferings of others who are at a distance from us . . . to extend our sym­
pathies beyond 'the little limits of our state and our neighborhood.'"15 
The fuel for that process of extensive sympathy was the laborious chron­
icle of the brutalities inflicted on the bodies of slaves, a chronicle that 
invited the white reader to switch places, to imagine those pains inflicted 
on his own tender flesh. It is on the ground of that constructed empathy 
that the moral argument against slavery then assumes its full force.
When we are not eyewitnesses to pain, we can only get access to it 
through someone else's description. An account of the pain of others 
excites our sympathy "in proportion to the vivacity or dullness of the 
conception,"16 as Smith puts it, and this is true whether it is fiction or 
nonfiction. Uncle Tom's Cabin would certainly qualify there. He goes on 
to describe how fiction can cause a suspension of disbelief, not just about 
the fact that it is merely a story but the fact that it is not about us.

Our joy for the deliverance of those heroes of tragedy or romance who interest 
us, is as sincere as our grief for their distress, and our fellow-­feeling with their 
misery is not more real than that with their happiness. We enter into their grati­
tude towards those faithful friends who did not desert them in their difficulties; 
and we heartily go along with their resentment against those perfidious trai­
tors who injured, abandoned, or deceived them. In every passion of which the 
mind of man is susceptible, the emotions of the by-­stander always correspond 
to what, by bringing the case home to himself, he imagines should be the senti­
ments of the sufferer.17
It is one thing to cajole someone into extending their sympathy to other 
human beings. They are, after all, human. They feel pain. They are just 
like us. It is another to use fiction to do so beyond the species line, beyond 
the line of naturally occurring creatures altogether, to the android or the 
genetically engineered synthetic organism. In one sense, of course, it is 
the attempt to provoke the same imaginative, empathic leap that Smith 
and Clark describe. But how to induce that leap in the face of the visceral 
understanding that these beings are not like us, that they are synthetic 
and not natural? It is not merely that they were made. They were made 
by us. The earnest abolitionists could conjoin the sympathy for slaves' 
abused bodies with the Christian moral conviction that we are all God's 
children, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. But 
when we come to the android or the genetically engineered hybrid, we 
return to the argument I put into the mouth of the fictional creator of the 
Chimpys: "I am their creator, and I can assure you that I gave them no 
such rights." If you are a novelist or a filmmaker, how do you get past that 
objection? And does that effort tell us anything about the likely future of 
the debate over the personhood of artificial beings?
To answer both questions, I turn to Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, 
a science fiction novel, and Blade Runner, the very different but equally 
brilliant movie based on it. Some of you will say that you hate science 
fiction. I would urge you to think twice. That is like saying you do not 
like books set in the past or books set in other countries. The generaliza­
tion undermines itself as it is uttered. What you may hate is bad science 
fiction, and there is a lot of it. Strange, ugly words that play no role in the 
plot, lengthy descriptive passages about poorly rendered futures before 
any character does anything, societies that are technologically changed 
out of all recognition while sex roles are apparently stuck in the 1950s,

CHAPTER 1
deus ex machina plot twists, with the emphasis on the machina; there 
is much to dislike here. But good science fiction, which, like a science 
experiment, changes just one or two variables about our world and then 
spins out a beautifully written story of the reality that ensues, characters 
like us in a world not ours, that is a thing of joy.
When Ursula K. Le Guin imagines a world without private property in 
The Dispossessed18 or Cory Doctorow conjures a society in which reputa­
tional capital is the real currency19—­both worlds filled with sympathetic, 
flawed characters—­they give us something precious: an ability to step 
away from our own world and find it, for a moment, strange. The Ger­
mans have a word (of course) for the sundering that happens when an 
author deliberately smashes the suspension of disbelief: Verfremdung. "It's 
just a play," screams the actor in a Brecht production, hoping to shock 
the audience out of the thrall of the theater and make them wonder if 
they need to do the same thing with the suspension of disbelief produced 
by the structures and roles of their own society.
For me, science fiction has always done this to my own quotid­
ian world. It has done so even better than political or economic the­
ory's thought experiments (the Veil of Ignorance, the State of Nature, 
the Coase Theorem, the Efficient Capital Market), or the string of awful 
consequences a lawyer conjures up in an argument or a court decision 
(we call them "parades of horribles," which sounds like a Diane Arbus 
Thanksgiving March). The ability to create a world and then be limited by 
it—­to follow its dictates out to the end with rigor and discipline, while 
making strange the familiar—­is no less to be prized in fiction than politi­
cal theory. And that is what Do Androids Dream and Blade Runner bring to 
our discussion of the line.

him on TV. Cheery, cheesy commercialism pervades his life. Entertain­
ment is provided through shows everyone watches and then discusses 
the next day at work. Corporations and their messages are everywhere. 
Social position is measured partly by the possession of certain status 
objects. Deckard's wife is depressed. He worries about his job. If he were 
a character of John Updike's or Philip Roth's, you'd expect him to have 
a mild midlife crisis punctuated by suburban adultery and martinis. It is 
as if the Civil Rights movement and the 1960s critique of the bourgeoisie 
never happened. Then again, in the real world from which I write these 
words, there are self-­described white supremacists happily talking about 
the influence they recently had, and hope to have again, at the highest 
levels of the federal government. So how strange can an alternative real­
ity be?
Strange, it turns out. There are a few minor adjustments necessary to 
get from our world to Deckard's. The novel is set in the United States after 
a nuclear war. The environment has been devastated. Millions are dead. 
In particular, nonhuman animals have been nearly eliminated. They are 
now treated with reverence; ownership of an animal is a potent status 
symbol. Deckard and his wife cannot afford one, so they keep up appear­
ances and fool their neighbors with a robotic replica of a sheep while 
aspiring to upgrade to something real. Deckard works as a blade runner, 
a bounty hunter, trained to track down and kill androids—­synthetically 
created robotic beings that do much of mankind's dangerous work, par­
ticularly off-­planet, where most of humanity's best and brightest have 
already fled. These androids are so humanlike that a behavioral psychol­
ogy exam—­the Voight-­Kampff Test—­is needed to detect them. In a partic­
ularly dark moment of irony, it turns out that the test measures empathy, 
which, we are told, androids lack. Some of the questions, in fact, require 
showing an intensity of empathy for animals that the readers of this book 
might also lack. But the people in the almost animal-­free world of Do 
Androids Dream are more reverent:
Rick, selecting question three, said, "You are given a calfskin wallet on your 
birthday." Both gauges immediately registered past the green and onto the red; 
the needles swung violently and then subsided. "I wouldn't accept it," Rachael 
said. "Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police." After mak­
ing a jot of notation Rick continued, turning to the eighth question of the

CHAPTER 1
Voight-­Kampff profile scale. "You have a little boy and he shows you his butter­
fly collection, including his killing jar." "I'd take him to the doctor." Rachael's 
voice was low but firm. Again, the twin gauges registered, but this time not so 
far. He made a note of that, too.20
Deckard worries about false positives with his Voight-­Kampff Test. Perhaps 
a person with schizophrenia might show a replicant's lack of empathy 
and accidentally be "retired"—­note the euphemism for "eliminated"—­by 
a blade runner. Look back at the test above, reader. Would you pass? Yet 
Deckard hardly ever worries about the converse. What if androids are in 
fact persons? Yes, in Deckard's world they are artificially created, but what 
if they should still be recognized as people? What if it is a major failing of 
human empathy that they are not? Deckard's society tests and then kills 
them based on a purportedly scientific measure of lack of empathy. And 
what precisely is that lack of empathy? That they have failed adequately 
to respond to a hypothetical test of ethics involving a nonhuman. Noth­
ing could be more painfully ironic.
But that by no means exhausts the strangeness of this world. Take 
the Penfield mood organs that Deckard and his wife use, which allow 
one precisely to dial a particular emotional mood. This is something that 
goes beyond an attitude-­adjusting beer after a hard day. This is cyberpunk 
Roth and Updike: "Run, neural code of Rabbit, run!"
Appearing beside him, her long nightgown trailing wispily, Iran shut off the 
TV set. "Okay, I give up; I'll dial. Anything you want me to be; ecstatic sexual 
bliss—­I feel so bad I'll even endure that. What the hell. What difference does it 
make?" "I'll dial for both of us," Rick said, and led her back into the bedroom. 
There, at her console, he dialed 594: pleased acknowledgment of husband's 
superior wisdom in all matters.21
To paraphrase the comedian John Oliver, #Irony. #Feminism.
Animals are loved and protected by law in Deckard's world, far more 
so than in our own world. They are so revered that, because of their scar­
city, many of them are actually replicas, which are cherished nonethe­
less. Almost perfect replicas of humans, however, are stalked and killed 
after being tested for their empathy for nonhuman animals. Moods, too, 
can be artificial, so that one is left doubting what the idea of authentic­
ity even means. The replicants are violent. They murder several humans 
and attack Deckard. Does that show how important it is to protect the

45
boundaries of our species from homicidal murdering robots, or should we 
see it as the frenzied violence of a slave revolt, something that would not 
have happened if replicants had been treated as people? Deckard sleeps 
with one of the replicants. Does this prove that love can cross the line or 
merely that we have invented potentially homicidal sex dolls? There is a 
Kafkaesque scene—­and I mean that in the "if you had lifted this and put 
it in The Trial, Kafka's biographer Max Brod might have said, 'Yeah, that 
checks out, leave it in'" sense—­in which Deckard encounters an entire 
fake police station staffed by replicants. Maybe Deckard himself is a repli­
cant? His partner? And if we don't know who is a replicant and who is a 
human, how can we say they are less human than we are? These contra­
dictions are wound through the plot. If you don't look at them they are 
not obvious, but they are still unsettlingly visible out of the corner of the 
reader's eye, a moral version of the graphic disorientation in an Escher 
drawing. Is this floor or ceiling? Up or down?
Philip K. Dick is playing with the line.
At every stage, the novel probes the coherence of our moral intuitions 
in a way that Adam Smith might have appreciated. Should empathy be 
the moral warrant for personhood? If so, does that prove that the repli­
cants lack it, or that we do? If a synthetic entity can pass as human so that 
we cannot distinguish it from the real thing, does that suggest or require 
that we grant it personhood, and, if so, why? (Hal, the imaginary AI in 
the introduction to this book, was able not only to pass the Turing Test 
but even to administer it accurately to others, just as the blade runners 
do with their test. What follows from that fact?) Deckard's society shows 
more empathy for nonhuman animals than our own. It is even able to 
suspend disbelief and cherish a synthetic replica of an animal. Does that 
prove that his culture is morally superior to ours, or is it simply a warn­
ing of the ease with which we can project qualities that do not exist onto 
a mere facsimile, as the colonel did with the mine-­clearing robot? In a 
world of mood organs and electric sheep, what does the line between 
natural and synthetic even mean?
At the end of the book, the author seems to suggest that all foun­
dational beliefs, whether in Mercerism—­the empathetic religion of his 
world, which the book suggests is a fraud—­or in the authenticity of his 
robotic sheep, are based on a willing embrace of delusion, a delusion that

CHAPTER 1
might actually be worth that hug. The reader is left to wonder whether 
Deckard would apply the same logic to his own humanity. Or indeed, 
to ours. For where on earth could our consciousness come from, if there 
is no ghost in the machine? Alan Turing, the great computer scientist, 
made the same point about his Turing Test for machine consciousness. 
He makes use of an argument that B. F. Skinner and the behaviorists later 
developed into a successful intellectual franchise; since we do not have 
direct evidence of the mental states of other human beings, we could 
always solipsistically posit them to be rule-­following automata:
I think that most of those who support the argument from consciousness could 
be persuaded to abandon it rather than be forced into the solipsist position. 
They will then probably be willing to accept our test. I do not wish to give the 
impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. There is, for 
instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. 
But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can 
answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper.22
Turing is trying to answer the question "can machines think?" What 
test will we set them in order to find out? If we set a higher bar than 
"seeming human," can we meet it ourselves? Or, in the words of Skin­
ner with which I began this section, "[T]he real question is not whether 
machines think but whether men do. The mystery which surrounds a 
thinking machine already surrounds a thinking man."23 Is the question 
not whether Deckard is a replicant but whether we all are? That question 
is one that Blade Runner, the movie based on Do Androids Dream, takes up.
Blade Runner has lots of similarities to Do Androids Dream, of course, 
but the differences might be more striking. The replicants are not cyber­
netic robots; rather, they are creatures of synthetic biology and genetic 
science, a very conscious choice by the director Ridley Scott, who was 
fascinated by the social changes that genetic engineering might bring. 
Are we dealing with Hal now, or Chimpy? The film is set in dystopian Los 
Angeles rather than dystopian San Francisco. (Think this is a trivial dif­
ference? Ask a resident of either city.) Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) 
does not confront a mildly radioactive version of a 1950s organization 
man world but a landscape out of cyberpunk film noir, where darkness 
intertwines with occasional beams of light, natural or human-­made, to 
dazzle, obscure, or highlight. When we first meet him, he is hunched

your own land!). He wants to order four dumplings, but each customer is 
allowed only two (consumers with money not able to eat as much as they

As he waits for his food, Deckard idly rubs his disposable wooden 
chopsticks against each other to get rid of the inevitable splinters after 
breaking them apart. An exchange student from Korea in my Law and Lit­
erature class said, "That's the most casually and unselfconsciously Asian 
thing I've ever seen a Western person do." Norms have changed, and if 
you have an implicit assumption that the majority of the United States 
is white and English-­speaking, or that it doesn't rain in LA, the change 
might be disconcerting. Giant blimps float through the skies, displaying 
video advertisements for the off-­world colonies that, with wonderfully 
jarring effect, juxtapose a cheery voice narration straight from a 1950s 
public health video, with a geisha-­like female face in stylized makeup. 
Japanese brand names are everywhere. The movie was made at the height 
of the Asian-­takeover fears of the 1980s and it shows. Magnificent corpo­
rate buildings rise, like Aztec pyramids, above the squalor of the streets. 
Some artificial persons are doing very well in this world, it seems. There 
are flying cars. And later, feral homeless children stealing machine parts 
from the flying cars.
Before Deckard's food even arrives, the viewer's sense of estrangement, 
of uncertainty, of identity crisis is well under way. All of that takes the 
director about a minute. It is a tour de force and one that, when watched 
again recently, was strangely prophetic about racial anxiety, xenophobia, 
and fear of the Other. When we find out that Deckard's job has been to 
police the boundary line of our species, it all just fits right in. "We want 
him on that wall!" Or do we?
Like Dick, Ridley Scott produces disorientation and sudden flashes of 
enlightenment in a flickering, moral seizure-­inducing pattern. The very 
beginning of the film features a replicant named Leon (played by Brion 
James) being given the Voight-­Kampff Test by a blade runner. Leon is like 
the student who fights the hypothetical question in a classroom discus­
sion of ethics: the student who responds to the trolley problem by saying

CHAPTER 1
that he always takes the subway, and why are those kids on the track in 
the first place? Leon constantly pushes back at the questions he is asked. 
Told by the interviewer that he is in a desert, he wants to know which 
one. Given a hypothetical situation involving him flipping over a tortoise 
and leaving it in the hot sun, he keeps asking questions. "What's a tor­
toise? Why would I flip it over? Did you think up these questions or did 
someone else write them for you?"
We are caught between wondering whether Leon is "on the spec­
trum" and realizing that we have so internalized the role of student in 
the highly artificial world of test-­taking, with its constraint-­free questions 
designed to probe certain responses, that Leon's perfectly normal inqui­
ries seem naive. His leaden puzzlement is actually endearing—­right until 
the moment when the interviewer asks about Leon's mother. "Let me tell 
you about my mother," says Leon. Then he pulls out a gun and shoots 
the interviewer. Motherhood, it seems, is a touchy issue for the syntheti­
cally created. Of course, in shooting a member of the species that has 
created him, who is actually employed to track him down and kill him, 
maybe Leon is telling us about his mother. There is an instantaneous shift 
from earnest, confused student asking for reassurance from the teacher to 
homicidal killing machine striking back at its creators. Scott is not going 
to make it easy for us by making the replicants warm and fuzzy.
The Nexus 6 replicants at the heart of the movie have escaped back 
down to earth by stealing a shuttle and killing the crew. Led by Roy Batty 
(played by Rutger Hauer), they are in search of ways to prolong their very 
short lifespan—­a limit hardwired into their DNA by their creator, the 
Tyrell Corporation. Psalm 90 tells us that the Lord has given us "three 
score years and ten." Tyrell's creations get four years.
Their search for a way to stave off impending death gives the movie 
poignancy amid the menace, with strangely touching moments. Roy 
and Leon question one genetic designer, Hannibal Chew, who disclaims 
any knowledge of biological lifespan. "I just do eyes." The replicants are 
standing in street clothes, quite comfortable in a cryogenically chilled 
facility as the designer shivers in front of them. Despite his entirely war­
ranted fear of what is about to happen to him, Chew says, "You Nexus, 
huh? I design your eyes." It is not entirely clear, but it looks as though 
he makes an abortive gesture toward the face of a being who is doubtless

about to kill him. It's an odd moment of craftsman's pride, even tender­
ness. "Chew. If only you could see what I have seen, with your eyes," 
replies Roy. Yes, Ridley Scott is telling us, this is a designed creature and a 
dangerous one, confronting its makers in anger. But it is also an "I" with 
emotions and memories, a person inside that skull, who wishes that the 
designer could see the world through his eyes, walk a mile in his shoes. Of 
course, we cannot change places with the Other, except in our imagina­
tion. Will we? It is Adam Smith's discussion of empathy all over again. 
And the question I posed earlier—­how can a being we designed also be a 
person?—­is front and center.
PRIMING: THE MORAL STROBOSCOPE
Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep uses a number of men­
tal dislocations to shake our brains out of their familiar patterns, to con­
front the Other with an innocent eye. There is the Voight-­Kampff Test 
that denies interviewees personhood if they cannot feel enough empa­
thy for a different species and yet never causes the humans to doubt 
their own lack of empathy for their creations. There is almost fetishis­
tic worship of nonhuman animals in an ecologically ravaged world. The 
book brilliantly uses the power of language over our imagination to run 
thought experiments. What if there were a mood engine that precisely 
and artificially changed moods? What if there were a religion based on 
empathy? But Blade Runner is a movie. It can show us the line rather than 
just tell us about it.
This book is about the line of personhood. What is on the other side of 
that line? What are the edge cases, the things that we use to demonstrate 
the boundary between us—­persons, legally recognized entities with an 
array of rights—­and nonpersons? It is easy to say that a chair or a table is 
not a person, but what about the closer calls, the examples that philoso­
phers through history have used to support their definitions of the "it" 
that makes us, us? Most obviously, we have nonhuman animals. They are 
like us in many ways, but whereas I can own a chimpanzee or a dolphin, 
the reverse is not the case. We have simulacra: the mannequin, statue, or 
wax model. They look eerily human, but we know they are not. We can 
even add functional similarity to physical similarity. We have robots that

CHAPTER 1
look and act like humans, and we have software programs that mimic 
aspects of human speech or cognition. We have artificial, genetically 
engineered beings based in part on human genetic material. Finally, we 
have the temporal dimension of the line: dust to dust, ashes to ashes. 
When does something become someone and vice versa? Does life, does per­
sonhood, begin at conception, viability, birth? Does it cease when there 
is no breathing, no heartbeat, no brainstem activity? Time, too, is an 
edge case. Animals, mannequins, robots, software emulations of human­
ity, and the life-­death divide. Each of these might help us illuminate what 
makes us, us. Blade Runner explores all of them.
J. F. Sebastian is one of my favorite characters in Blade Runner. A tal­
ented genetic designer who suffers from Methuselah Syndrome, he 
is aging too fast and will die young, yet his is a natural condition and 
not the programmed lifespan of the replicants. He lives alone in the 
decayed and abandoned Bradbury Building, an 1893 Los Angeles land­
mark whose name also ironically calls to mind a science fiction legend, 
though nothing could be less like the endless childhood summers of Ray 
Bradbury's fiction than the dark, rainy, and dilapidated world of Blade 
Runner. His only companions are an array of fantastical mannequins and 
toy robots or genetically engineered play-­animals—­scaled-­up versions 
of a child's clockwork soldiers or stuffed teddy bears. The stiffly march­
ing, Pinocchio-­nosed Kaiser and his companion bear suggest a Victorian 
playroom but also a twenty-­first-­century robotics shop or genetic labora­
tory. The marching figures' movements are jerky, like clockwork, but they 
speak, see, and even greet their master by name when he returns home. 
It is both beautiful and sad. As Sebastian himself points out in explaining 
why he is not lonely, "I make friends. I am a genetic designer." Perhaps 
his glorious toy room is a reflection of, or a comfort for, his lost youth. 
He is a sympathetic character. The toys do not seem fully sentient but 
he is literally making friends, and, in his day job, he has been one of the 
designers of the replicants.
One of those replicants, Pris (played by Daryl Hannah), is sent to 
befriend Sebastian as part of the attempt to lengthen their four-­year lifes­
pan. Pris is a "pleasure model" replicant. If humans can design sentient, 
genetically engineered beings, the movie suggests, nothing is less surpris­
ing than turning them into sex toys. Indeed, today's tech journalism has

featured many stories about the use of robots as companions for those 
who live alone24 and, yes, as talking sex dolls.25 Siri in lingerie, as it were. 
As an article in the New York Times puts it:
[C]onsenting is not something these robots are capable of. That doesn't matter, 
the argument goes, because these are not women, but animatronic objects, so 
consent is not necessary. The same reasoning is used to deflect fears that such 
robots could influence societal attitudes toward women. "She's not a some­
one. She is a machine," their creators are quick to respond when questions of 
moral ambiguity are raised. "Is it ethically dubious to force my toaster to make 
my toast?"26
Pris is dressed in an outfit straight from a 1980s punk club: racoon-­like 
eye makeup, torn fishnet stockings, boots, a wild, platinum blonde thatch 
of hair. She conceals herself in a pile of trash near Sebastian's building, 
like a Dickensian street child, then bursts out in fake alarm when he 
arrives, colliding with him in the process. She is alone, "kind of an 
orphan"—which, as a replicant, she actually is. She is beautiful, seem­
ingly vulnerable, and has nowhere to go. Sebastian offers her shelter.
Psychologists have explored the power of priming a viewer or experi­
mental subject, providing a context that will cause them to interpret or 
remember material in a particular way. Some of that research was specu­
lative and made implausibly grand claims that have been impossible to 
replicate. However, the basic mechanism has been repeatedly tested and 
confirmed. To quote Psychology Today:
Priming is a nonconscious form of human memory concerned with perceptual 
identification of words and objects. It refers to activating particular representa­
tions or associations in memory just before carrying out an action or task. For 
example, a person who sees the word "yellow" will be slightly faster to recognize 
the word "banana." This happens because yellow and banana are closely associ­
ated in memory. Additionally, priming can also refer to a technique in psychol­
ogy used to train a person's memory in both positive and negative ways.27
Throughout the scene in Sebastian's apartment, the movie sends a 
stroboscopic set of images designed to prime us to see Pris, and later Roy, 
as different entities on either side of the line. It is done with malice afore­
thought and at remarkably high speed. Pris's raccoon eye makeup does 
remind me fondly of punk rock clubs in the 1980s, but it also looks like, 
well, an actual raccoon, particularly when Pris bends and sniffs repeatedly

CHAPTER 1
at the sleeping Sebastian. Humans do not normally sniff at each other 
like dogs. She is an animal! Pris is almost inhumanly perfect both in 
looks and physical abilities. When she reaches into a glass beaker of vig­
orously boiling water to pull out a hard-­boiled egg, without even notic­
ing the heat, we are unsurprised. She tosses the egg to Sebastian who 
has to juggle it because it is so hot. She is a robot! She is beautiful and 
beguiling: more than one audience member has looked at her longingly 
and then had the cognitive dissonance Ridley Scott surely intended. Are 
you admiring a beautiful woman or looking lustfully at a sex doll? Ew. 
When Roy comes to visit, they hungrily kiss each other, showing no shy­
ness in front of Sebastian, but they also sniff at each other like two dogs 
reunited. She's an animal! Or a sex toy! Or in love! But Pris is also a child. 
She shows joy at Sebastian's playful creations and fear of pursuit, and she 
oscillates between manipulation and apparent affection for Sebastian 
himself. Hearing the news of Leon's death from Roy and realizing that 
there are only two of them left, she is distraught: "Then we are stupid, 
and we'll die."
When Deckard arrives looking for her, she hides among Sebastian's 
clockwork figures, draped in gauze. The camouflage is remarkably suc­
cessful. Her immobility, her waxy perfection of features and form—­she 
is a mannequin! A doll! Right until Deckard lifts the gauze veil with the 
barrel of a gun, and, shrieking like a hawk, she attacks him with inhu­
man strength. She is a killer android! Daryl Hannah is a former ballet 
dancer and performed some of her own gymnastic stunts. In the middle 
of the fight with Deckard, she performs an absurdly difficult gymnas­
tic tumbling routine—­intentionally jarring coming from a homicidal 
killing machine. The Terminator meets Olympic floor exercises. When 
Deckard finally shoots her, brutally interrupting the perfection of her 
flips and handsprings, her body has a violent seizure on the ground as 
if she were being electrocuted, while she shrieks like a dying animal. 
And bleeds. The priming comes fast. Flash. A beautiful woman. Flash. 
A killer android. Flash. A lifelike mannequin. Flash. A child. Flash. A 
dying animal, screeching in unbearable pain. For me, that moral strobo­
scope explains the power of the movie better than any other factor. It is a 
remarkable piece of work and a deeply troubling one. Is it really so easy to

manipulate our sympathies? Are our categories so unstable? Do we have 
too much empathy? Too little?
Blade Runner is not alone in exploring these themes, of course. Con­
temporary depictions of artificial humanity such as the HBO television 
adaptation of Michael Crichton's 1973 Westworld28 touch on many of the 
same issues. The robotic hosts in the Western theme park in that show 
become a canvas on which humans can paint our own moral portrait, 
revealing what we would do to those who had no rights but looked like 
us. Rape, murder, torture, a few rescue fantasies: the picture is a depress­
ing one. If the moneylender in Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment had 
been described to Raskolnikov as a mere clockwork toy, think how his 
murderous Nietzschean fantasies could have flourished. But perhaps 
Blade Runner's replicants disorient us about the line in a different, or addi­
tional, way. Westworld gives us a dawning realization—­"Wow, the hosts 
are sentient! And they are in revolt. (Dolores seemed so nice before!)" 
Blade Runner wants to disorient us from moment to moment and scene to 
scene, snapping us back and forth through a range of implicit character­
izations: animal, android, psychopathic monster, person, sex doll, man­
nequin. Return for a moment to the Adam Smith excerpt on sympathy 
with which I began this discussion: "Though our brother is on the rack, 
as long as we ourselves are at our ease, our senses will never inform us of 
what he suffers. They never did, and never can, carry us beyond our own 
person, and it is by the imagination only that we can form any concep­
tion of what are his sensations."29
But what if our imagination flipped back and forth between view­
ing him as our brother, a mannequin, an animal, an implacable killer 
android, a toaster that can't say no? A person? Blade Runner seems to tell 
us that our empathy—­already unreliable even in valuing others of our 
own species—­will be sorely challenged in two ways. First, the possibility 
for priming will be more present than in any of the prior personhood 
wars because many of the primings will be true. Chimpy is partly an 
animal. Hal's consciousness is, in part, a result of human programming. 
Pris is, in part, a synthetic construct designed as a sex toy. Roy is a fright­
ening android soldier. All of them are creatures of our own design, our 
own creation.

CHAPTER 1
This brings us to the inscrutability paradox. If we know how you were 
designed, if we understand how you "think" because we programmed you 
to do so, how can we see you as anything but a mannequin or a wind-­up 
doll rather than an entity with free will? How does empathy work in that 
situation, particularly when there will be many who have economic or 
ideological interests in pushing the particular priming that humanizes or 
dehumanizes our creations? Particularly when our skepticism about each 
new claim of personhood might have very good arguments behind it? 
But if your behavior is produced through methods and paths we do not 
completely understand, which is already the case even in some of today's 
neural nets, then will we be caught between fear and incomprehension? 
Neither of those is a fertile basis for empathy.
Second, our empathy will be challenged because we can design around 
it. These are our creations. If a particular body shape or set of responses 
or pattern of speech or neotenous facial features make us class an entity 
as human, then the designers can choose to keep it or change it. What 
would Smith make of a world where our brother could be designed to 
look like he was part of the rack? Or a cartoon character getting a nice 
lumbar stretch? Smith dealt with a world where the differences across 
which empathy must reach were naturally occurring, even a given. In the 
strange world of Hal and Chimpy, those differences will be chosen.
In Blade Runner's climactic moments, Roy uses a ruse to gain entrance 
to the Tyrell Corporation headquarters and to Tyrell's own rooms. The 
creation confronts his creator. Tyrell asks why he has not come before. 
"It is not easy to meet one's Maker," says Roy. A moment later comes 
one of my favorite pieces of dialogue. Roy asks whether the maker 
can change his own creation. "What seems to be the problem?" says 
Tyrell, like an urbane physician. "Death," answers Roy. Can Tyrell help? 
The answer, it turns out, is no, but Tyrell tells him to revel in his time. 
"The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long, and you have 
burned so very, very bright, Roy." As a consolation, it is dramatically 
unsuccessful. Though Roy seems to be about to confess to his father—­
"I have done questionable things"—­he then adds, "but nothing the 
god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for." And on that 
note, Roy passionately kisses, and then kills, the man who made him. 
Tyrell, too, has done "questionable things" unrestrained by any god of

55
biomechanics. The creation is judging the creator. How will we be judged 
by ours?
***
Readers find many, many messages in Do Androids Dream and in Blade 
Runner—­one reason for the enduring power of those works. Clearly, they 
are both meditations on empathy and personhood, but to me it seems 
they go beyond a simple injunction that we should love (electronic and 
genetically altered) others as ourselves. Instead, I see two themes, both 
central to this book.
First, our beliefs about naturalness, about identity, about empathy, are 
built on assumptions that start to seem arbitrary, even ludicrous, when 
presented in the fun-­house mirror of an alternative world that is recogniz­
able yet different from our own. We could mock the Voight-­Kampff Test 
for its ironic focus on empathy for animals to deny empathy to androids. 
What hypocrites and fools the inhabitants of that world are! How blind 
they are to their own contradictions! But that is not the message I get 
from Do Androids Dream and Blade Runner. It is more like "judge not, lest 
we be judged." Do you think we will do better? That question should 
prompt worried humility rather than hubristic condemnation.
The process of empathy that Adam Smith describes may be a basis 
for ethics, but it will be based on a leap of faith, a projection of iden­
tity that will probably rest on a pattern of beliefs full of blind spots and 
inconsistencies, one that will be in productive tension with our moral 
theories and our attempts to reason our way to the right answer. Each side 
will need the other. Our discussions of synthetic personhood will exist 
in a dialectic between sympathy and syllogism, leaps of empathy and 
flashes of disgust, hopes that we can realize the angels of our better nature 
and deep fears that our creations will destroy us. Or judge us. And, as I 
pointed out earlier, our empathy will be subject to radically conflicting, 
and partially truthful, primings that cause us to humanize or dehuman­
ize our creations—­to push them away into the realm of nonhuman ani­
mal, clockwork mannequin, clever software emulation, toaster that can't 
say no or, indeed, to recognize them as persons though we know that 
we made them. What's more, some of those primings will be designed

CHAPTER 1
into our synthetic creations on purpose. Think of the Chimpy deliberately 
designed to look ape-­like and to lack spoken language. Humanities gradu­
ate students quickly learn that if they do not know the answer to a ques­
tion, "it is socially constructed" will generally get them off the hook. Our 
process of empathy for our synthetic creations will exist in a landscape 
that is literally made by our own hands. This is "social construction" with 
a vengeance.
Second, uncertainty about personhood does not stop when we get to 
our own species line, or our own identity. Deckard is not the only one 
to doubt his humanity. When we come to explain why we are conscious, 
human, how it is that there is a thinking "I" inside of humanity that has 
been given dominion over the animal and mechanical world, we could 
be subject to the same skepticism that the Google engineers directed at 
Hal. The question is not whether Deckard is a replicant. The question is 
whether we all are.
Earlier I quoted Turing pointing out that it was hard to prove that 
humans, too, were more than rule-­following automata. He was not the 
first person to make this argument. In 1887, Samuel Butler had made 
the same point: "[T]he theory that living beings are conscious machines, 
can be fought as much and just as little as the theory that machines are 
unconscious living beings; everything that goes to prove either of these 
propositions goes just as well to prove the other also."30 It is (electric) 
turtles all the way down. To solve the problem of recognizing the Other, 
it seems, Do Androids Dream and Blade Runner are telling us we must first 
know ourselves.
In the movie's final scene, Roy returns to Sebastian's apartment alone; 
we are left to wonder what he has done with the gentle man who helped 
him and Pris and who tried to flee when he saw Tyrell killed. Roy finds 
Pris dead, calls her name, cries, daubs himself with her blood, and, howl­
ing like a wolf, sets off in pursuit of Deckard. The stroboscope of prim­
ings begins again, flashing like the flickering lights in which the scene is 
filmed. Roy goes from chanting murderous nursery rhymes, to animalis­
tic howling, to inhuman feats of strength, to Socratic humor, toying with 
Deckard like a cat with a mouse. "Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed 
opponent. I thought you were supposed to be good. Aren't you the . . . 
good man?" Is he?

57
As the chase continues, we can see that Roy's death is coming closer. 
His hand seizes up and—­metaphor alert—­he jams a nail through his palm 
to keep it open. Yet if Roy is supposed to be a Christ figure, the gift of the 
god of biomechanics is a horrifyingly ambiguous one, and it is not clear 
our sins will be expiated by his death.
Finally, Roy has a terrified Deckard defenseless, dangling by one hand 
from the roof's edge and about to fall. Deckard's fingers slip. Inexplicably, 
Roy reaches out, across that short but enormous divide, grasps Deckard's 
wrist, and saves him. He gives mercy to the man who has killed his lover 
when he himself has only moments of life remaining. In those moments, 
Roy returns to the same point he had raised with Hannibal Chew, the 
things his eyes have viewed. "I've seen things you people wouldn't 
believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-­beams 
glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be 
lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die."
These are profoundly human qualities: mercy; the bittersweet confron­
tation with mortality; the transitory nature of our consciousness and our 
memory; the impossibility of truly knowing another, of feeling what he 
or she feels or has lived. The essentially solitary way that all of us, not just 
the replicants, confront our impending crossing of the line between life 
and death, person and thing. "At the narrow passage, there is no brother, 
no friend."31 And yet, there is a consolation: our ability through language 
and art and empathy and dark, dark humor to share something, to reach 
out across that great divide.
Do we want to accept the gift of Roy's mercy—­sparingly dispensed to 
be sure—­but no less remarkable for it? Are we in fact willing to believe 
what his eyes have seen, to share his memories? Or do we leave him on 
the other side of the line? All of that, it seems, depends on how we define 
us as much as how we define him.
Perhaps that is the most important thing to realize from this chap­
ter. Grappling with the question of synthetic Others may bring about a 
reexamination of the nature of human identity and consciousness that is 
unparalleled since secular philosophers declared that we would have to 
learn to live with a God-­shaped hole at the center of our world. To draw 
the line for our creations, we must first draw it for ourselves. We have our 
own Voight-­Kampff Test to face.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
There is no security . . . against the ultimate development of mechanical con­
sciousness, in the fact of machines possessing little consciousness now. A mol­
lusc has not much consciousness. Reflect upon the extraordinary advance which 
machines have made during the last few hundred years, and note how slowly 
the animal and vegetable kingdoms are advancing. The more highly organised 
machines are creatures not so much of yesterday, as of the last five minutes, so 
to speak, in comparison with past time. Assume for the sake of argument that 
conscious beings have existed for some twenty million years: see what strides 
machines have made in the last thousand! May not the world last twenty mil­
lion years longer? If so, what will they not in the end become? Is it not safer to 
nip the mischief in the bud and to forbid them further progress?1
THE BUTLERIAN CHALLENGE
That passage was written in 1872. Samuel Butler, the anti-­Victorian icono­
clast whose novel The Way of All Flesh is one of the most searing critiques 
of the hypocrisies of his time, wrote a book 150 years ago that muses 
extensively on the possibility of machine consciousness.
Erewhon is a hard book to explain. The title is (nearly) "nowhere" 
backward—­the same thing that "utopia" means in Greek. Erewhon is an 
imaginary country and it is no utopia. Instead, it is a fun-­house mirror 
in which attentive readers could see Victorian society, and perhaps our 
society, reflected, reversed. The Erewhonians treat crime the way we do 
sickness and sickness the way we do crime, imprisoning people for being 
ill and relying on polite hypocrisies about criminality to excuse their own 
behavior. How nice it would be to say, "I'd love to come to your party, but 
I feel some shoplifting coming on." They punish people for having bad 
fortune. Arguably, so do we, and that is Butler's point. Their musical banks

parallel Victorian churches. The currency the musical banks traffic in is 
honored piously as the true wealth but hypocritically ignored in practice, 
where real money is what counts. Their universities are "colleges of unrea­
son," teaching abstruse and archaic doctrines but failing to inspire true 
critical thinking. As an academic myself, I'll leave that one alone. Their 
society even bans the killing of animals and the eating of meat, leading 
repressed carnivores to feel shame and often contract disease when they 
finally turn to the black market to gratify their illicit desires. It is a nice 
parallel to Victorian society's sexual repression, coupled with its enor­
mous, brutal sex trade. To put it mildly, little in the book is as it seems.
Unwary readers who encounter the two chapters about machine con­
sciousness out of context can be excused for taking them at face value. 
Was Butler seriously exploring the possibility of machine conscious­
ness? Was he so worried about rogue AI that he even proposed a ban on 
mechanical progress? Certainly, some people have read him that way. If 
you know Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel Dune, you have 
read about the "Butlerian Jihad" that banned machine intelligences in 
a distant future. The original Butler would have been amused by that 
nickname, I think. But just as the musical banks, the courts of illness, and 
the colleges of unreason are not what they appear to be, the discussion of 
machine intelligence was mainly supposed to be an allegory for another 
issue: his era's passionate debate over the scientific truth and theological 
implications of biological evolution.
Just what Butler was trying to say is a matter of some dispute. He him­
self seems either to have been deliberately ambiguous about it or to have 
changed his position.2 Some say he was criticizing evolution, claiming 
that the same arguments put forward for the gradually increasing com­
plexity of biological beings driven by natural selection would imply that 
machines could develop consciousness in similar ways. If so, the reduc­
tio ad absurdum is no longer so absurdum. Others say he was using the 
same form of argument to parody evolution's critics, and their relentless 
attempts to suppress, deny, stigmatize, and, if necessary, forbid evolu­
tion's teachings. That one has an unpleasantly modern ring, too.
Butler could have been using machine consciousness as a critical alle­
gory of evolution or an allegory against evolution's critics. Either way,

a Victorian-­era satirical dystopia accurately predicts our contemporary 
debates about thinking machines. It is as if Gulliver's Travels turned out 
to be a Yelp review of Lilliput as a tourist destination. ("Watch out for 
the little guys with the ropes! Would rate this place zero stars if I could!") 
There is a lesson in that. Whether or not he was serious, Butler was right 
that the same arguments that support biological evolution at least sug­
gest the possibility of machine consciousness. Indeed, as we will see, one 
possible method of machine learning relies explicitly on an evolutionary 
mechanism, though the "selfish genes" are algorithms and neural net­
works running on computers, competing for successful reproduction into 
the next generation. My imaginary Hal used just such a technique. But 
Butler is also right that the denunciations of evolution, the explanations 
of why it is scientifically impossible, will parallel relatively precisely some 
of the denunciations of AI consciousness and the philosophical explana­
tions that it is impossible. It is worth remembering that the critics were 
wrong about evolution.
More generally, Butler's work is a good starting place for our discussion 
for three reasons. First, Butler sees the fragility of the line, its contingent 
quality. Over the last 40 years, scientists such as the primatologist Frans 
de Waal have posed skeptical challenges to the idea of a firm, qualitative 
distinction between humans and nonhuman animals, finding examples 
of tool use, language, and so on in the animal world. But more than 
a hundred years earlier, Butler was pointing out that the lines between 
human and animal and human and machine are fuzzier than we might 
like to imagine. In fact, in words that seem deliberately provocative, But­
ler challenges both the machine-­animal distinction and the idea of quali­
tatively distinct human consciousness:
Where does consciousness begin, and where end? Who can draw the line? 
Who can draw any line? Is not everything interwoven with everything? Is not 
machinery linked with animal life in an infinite variety of ways? The shell of 
a hen's egg is made of a delicate white ware and is a machine as much as an 
egg-­cup is: the shell is a device for holding the egg, as much as the egg-­cup for 
holding the shell: both are phases of the same function; the hen makes the shell 
in her inside, but it is pure pottery. She makes her nest outside of herself for 
convenience' [sic] sake, but the nest is not more of a machine than the egg-­shell 
is. A "machine" is only a "device."3

CHAPTER 2
Having taken a shot at the firmness of the machine-­animal distinc­
tion, Butler turns to self-­awareness. Probably tongue-­in-­cheek, but no less 
enlightening for all that, Butler then muses on the consciousness of the 
humble potato:
Even a potato in a dark cellar has a certain low cunning about him which serves 
him in excellent stead. He knows perfectly well what he wants and how to get 
it. He sees the light coming from the cellar window and sends his shoots crawl­
ing straight thereto: they will crawl along the floor and up the wall and out at 
the cellar window; . . . we can imagine him saying, "I will have a tuber here 
and a tuber there, and I will suck whatsoever advantage I can from all my sur­
roundings. This neighbour I will overshadow, and that I will undermine; and 
what I can do shall be the limit of what I will do. He that is stronger and better 
placed than I, shall overcome me and him that is weaker I will overcome." The 
potato says these things by doing them, which is the best of languages. What is 
consciousness if this is not consciousness? . . . We find it difficult to sympathise 
with the emotions of a potato; so we do with those of an oyster. . . . Since . . . 
they do not annoy us by any expression of pain we call them emotionless; and 
so qua mankind they are; but mankind is not everybody.4
Now Butler has the attention not just of the Dune reader but the vegetar­
ian, who suddenly realizes that even vegetables might not be fair game. 
Butler's tongue-­in-­cheek ode to the possibilities of mind in everything 
from a steam engine to a potato actually fits into a once-­maligned theory 
of consciousness now enjoying a modest revival. Panpsychism, which 
dates back to ancient Greece,5 claims that mentality or mind is every­
where. It pervades material objects as well as living beings. Adherents run 
the gamut from mystics to scientists who believe we overstate the differ­
ences between animate and inanimate. To be fair, most contemporary 
panpsychists believe that consciousness reaches its fully developed form 
only in beings of sufficient complexity, but the potential is there in the 
humblest of things.
The second reason why Butler is a good starting point for any discus­
sion of the possibility of machine consciousness is even more basic. More 
than a century ago, he saw that any account of human consciousness 
that admits it comes from physical interactions in the brain and the ner­
vous system will find it hard to explain why other sets of physical inter­
actions, based on nonorganic processes, cannot produce consciousness. 
To put it another way, if we deny consciousness to machines because

63
no true consciousness can come from such a programmed, materialist 
origin, can we call ourselves conscious? Here, again, is Butler from 1887: 
"[T]he theory that living beings are conscious machines, can be fought as 
much and just as little as the theory that machines are unconscious liv­
ing beings; everything that goes to prove either of these propositions goes 
just as well to prove the other also."6 Seventy years later, Turing would 
use a similar argument in favor of the Imitation Game, or Turing Test for 
machine intelligence. If we cannot tell whether an entity is machine or 
human, even after extensive interaction, who are we to deny another 
entity consciousness? What ground do we have to stand on?
Finally, Butler's writing gives me, at least, a timescale for the debate. 
"The Book of the Machines" was written 150 years ago. The most com­
plex machines around Butler were steam engines, industrial looms, and 
mechanical calculators. Perhaps one could add the partially completed 
Babbage Difference Engine, beloved of steampunk science fiction read­
ers and computer science historians. Yet in that context, unimaginably 
primitive in our terms, he could still see that in the grand sweep of time, 
"[t]he more highly organised machines are creatures not so much of 
yesterday, as of the last five minutes." In other words, he could warn 
us—­with our Siris and ChatGPTs and our deep learning, convolutional 
neural nets massaging big data—­that the timescale of these advances is 
so short historically, and the pace so rapid, that we should doubt our 
ability to extrapolate confidently in either direction about the journey's 
final destination. That fact should discourage hubris both in those who 
are skeptical Artificial Intelligence will ever be developed, and those who 
are confident that it will arrive in some specific anticipated format and 
revolutionize the world in the very near future. Hubris, however, appears 
to be an endlessly renewable resource.
HUBRIS AND HUMILITY IN AI
The history of AI is a history of overconfident predictions. In August 
1955 a group of academic luminaries submitted a grant proposal to the 
Rockefeller Foundation for a summer workshop on AI. The document is 
famous partly for its historical importance—­and it is a grant proposal. 
Every time I read it, I find myself imagining equivalent texts from other

CHAPTER 2
historical moments. ("Executive Summary: Goal: to escape from slavery 
under Pharaoh. Needs: Method of parting the Red Sea. Also, snacks.") But 
the document is also famous for its ambition—­beginning a dialectic in 
AI research between wildly optimistic claims and pessimistic laments of 
difficulty that continues to this day. Note the goals:
We propose that a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligence be carried out 
during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. 
The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learn­
ing or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described 
that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how 
to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of 
problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a 
significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully 
selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.7
For a summer. Progress was not quite as fast as they imagined. Nev­
ertheless, ten years later, giants in the field such as Marvin Minsky and 
Herbert Simon were predicting General-­Purpose Artificial Intelligence or 
"machines . . . capable . . . of doing any work a man can do" by the 
1980s.8 Huge strides have been made in aspects of artificial intelligence—­
machine-­aided translation, facial recognition, autonomous locomotion, 
expert systems, and so on. But General AI—­an intelligence that exhibits all 
the qualities of human intelligence and capability—­has remained out of 
reach. Indeed, because the payoff from these more limited subsystems—­
which today power everything from Google Translate and image recogni­
tion to the recommendations of your streaming service—­is so rich, some 
researchers have argued that the goal of General AI was a snare and a delu­
sion. What was needed instead, they claimed, was a set of ever more pow­
erful subspecialties—­expert systems capable of performing discrete tasks 
extremely well but without the larger goal of achieving consciousness or 
passing the Turing Test. There might be "machines capable of doing any 
work a man can do," but they would be multiple different machines, with 
no ghost in the gears, no claim to a holistic consciousness.
It is worth noting that, under some definitions, that might be enough 
to be hailed as Artificial General Intelligence. For example, Metaculus, 
a site that solicits and aggregates predictions of future events, has as its 
criteria for high-­level General AI that it has to be able to pass a two-­hour 
adversarial Turing Test featuring text and images, assemble a complex

model car, and perform well on tests assessing a number of other capa­
bilities. The focus is on capabilities. In other words, if we could have a 
machine that did all of the things humans can do, from composing a son­
net to conversing fluently, from changing a lightbulb to piloting a plane, 
that would be enough. The development of such a multitalented machine 
would certainly transform our economy and society, but my interest is in 
AI personhood and potential consciousness; being an extremely compe­
tent collection of expert systems is not automatically enough. Beyond 
those skills, I am asking the question of whether there is some conscious­
ness, some set of morally salient capabilities, that would cause us to see 
the machine as a moral actor whose personhood should be recognized.
Despite the history of overconfidence and of setbacks, arguments that 
General AI will appear in the near future have not ended. Indeed, if any­
thing, the optimistic claims have become even more far-­reaching. Thirty 
years ago the buzzword among the most fervent AI optimists was the 
Singularity, a sort of technological liftoff point in which a combination 
of scientific and technical breakthroughs lead to an explosion of self-­
improving Artificial Intelligence coupled to a vastly improved ability to 
manipulate both our bodies and the external world through nanotech­
nology and genetic engineering.9 Writers such as Vernor Vinge and Ray 
Kurzweil used the term Singularity to refer to the point where, because 
of exponential technological growth, the graph of technological pro­
gress will go vertical or at least be impossible to predict using current 
tools. Assuming explosive and imminent advances in AI, they believed 
that we would soon have improvements not in technology alone, but in 
the intelligence that will create new technology. Intelligence itself will 
be transformed. Once we have built machines smarter than ourselves—­
machines capable of building machines smarter than themselves—­we 
will, by definition, be unable to predict the line that progress will take. 
Vinge, whose 1993 article10 initiated the focus on an AI Singularity, was 
pessimistic about what might result. Why should we assume that an 
intelligence vastly greater than our own would treat us any better than 
we treat chimpanzees? Kurzweil, by contrast, generally saw the Singular­
ity leading us into a glorious world of posthuman immortality.
Kurzweil's view seemed to resonate more in frothy, popular science 
discussions, but, in recent years, an alternative to Kurzweil's view has

CHAPTER 2
developed, one that hearkens back to Vinge's original caution. This per­
spective, associated with researchers such as Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nick 
Bostrom, shares with Kurzweil the intuition that Artificial General Intel­
ligence may arrive much sooner than many of us expect. It differs in that 
the consequences it foresees are by no means as benign. In Yudkowsky's 
words, "The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made 
out of atoms which it can use for something else."11 Far from bringing us 
immortality and a peaceful and insanely productive, ecologically sustain­
able world, Yudkowsky and his fellow skeptics argue that the Singularity 
could bring global devastation and even human extinction.
The term "singularity" is actually drawn from a memorial tribute given 
by Stanisław Ulam to the famous mathematician and information theo­
rist John von Neumann.12 It is normally quoted in an abbreviated form 
that suggests von Neumann's eminence can be enlisted in support of the 
optimistic Singularity vision. Read in full and in context, however, the 
original quotation uses the term "singularity" to refer to a different and 
less positive set of possibilities than Kurzweil's image. Ulam says of von 
Neumann:
Quite aware that the criteria of value in mathematical work are, to some extent, 
purely aesthetic, he once expressed an apprehension that the values put on 
abstract scientific achievement in our present civilization might diminish: "The 
interests of humanity may change, the present curiosities in science may cease, 
and entirely different things may occupy the human mind in the future." One 
conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and 
changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approach­
ing some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human 
affairs, as we know them, could not continue.13
Far from racing with delirious optimism into a technologically trans­
formed future, I read von Neumann, and perhaps Ulam, to have appre­
hensions about the "changes in the mode of human life" in a future that 
they could not predict and in which "human affairs, as we know them, 
could not continue." This is hardly the full-­throated endorsement of the 
optimistic Singularity. In fact, it sounds a Burkean note of caution that 
would later be echoed in Bostrom and Yudkowsky's darker visions of how 
AI might transform or destroy our world.
On the other hand, von Neumann is putting forward two prem­
ises central to the contemporary usage of the term. First, technological

progress—­or at least technological progress in some fields—­is exponen­
tial, not linear. (But for how long?) Second, while the first few stages of 
an exponential graph are not that different from a linear one, the line 
on the graph quickly goes almost vertical. This will lead those who are 
assuming more linear growth, or who are standing on the flatter part 
of the time curve, to dramatically overestimate how long technologi­
cal developments will take to achieve. It will also rapidly put the future 
out of sight from where we are, thus rendering it impossible to predict. 
Strikingly, despite this fact, some of the proponents of the Singularity 
do prophesy with apparent confidence about what will transpire after it 
occurs. Kurzweil imagines a posthuman, technologically enabled immor­
tality, for example.
To the uninitiated, the future painted in Kurzweil's 2005 The Singular­
ity Is Near sounds like a delightfully wacky fantasy, a high-­tech version of 
the rapture in which our posthuman bodies rise up to an endless virtual 
reality in the cloud, run by benign intelligences that have long ago tran­
scended our limits. A "version" of the rapture? That is the rapture. No 
wonder the more enthusiastic odes to the Singularity have a religious, 
chiliastic feel to them. Sometimes, that impression can get in the way of a 
careful assessment of the specific claims being made about AI that, while 
overly optimistic, are based on thought-­provoking premises.
If technological change (e.g., the doubling of computer chip capacity 
every 18 months to two years that is known as Moore's law) could con­
tinue on an exponential curve, then a dramatically different future will 
arrive far sooner than we expect. That is Kurzweil's central point, as it was 
von Neumann's. But many scientists warn that we are rapidly approach­
ing the physical limits of science in making transistors smaller. What's 
more, some have argued that, at our current levels of technology, cost-­
benefit analysis will no longer support the titanic investments required 
to continue to meet that benchmark. Moore's law may have ceased to be 
true already. The exponential graph may flatten out, whether it is flat­
tened by physics or balance sheets or both.
To be fair to those who believe in a short timeline to General AI, they 
generally do not predict a single, invariant, exponential curve but rather 
a stacked series of S-­curves in which a particular technology starts off 
slowly, hits an exponential period of innovation, flattens off, and is in

CHAPTER 2
turn replaced by a new technology that goes through the same stages. 
One way for this trend to continue in the realm of computer architecture 
would require us to predict, for example, that current chip designs would 
be overtaken by a new paradigm—­quantum computing, say, which would 
exploit the physics of the quanta such as the entanglement of quantum 
particles, Einstein's "spooky action at a distance." Of course, the dramatic 
advance does not have to be quantum computing. Perhaps Richard Feyn­
man was right and there is still room at the bottom, in the nanoscale, 
using technologies and heat dissipation methods we only dimly under­
stand now. Or perhaps some combination of biological computing and 
machine computing will open the next frontier. Perhaps the transforma­
tion will not primarily be to the hardware at all but rather in the software, 
with new techniques of machine learning producing quantum leaps in 
performance. Regardless of the specific technique, the large claim is that 
we will continue to find new revolutionary technologies that will enable 
yet another S-­curve in computer capacity. Yet how can we confidently 
predict such paradigm shifts in technology? By definition, they are out­
side of our current technological frame of reference.
The speed of technological transformation will be particularly hard to 
predict if we are talking about multiple technologies, sometimes accelerat­
ing on exponential curves, having unexpected synchronistic effects on 
each other. Take the evolution of computer networks from 1990 to 2005, 
for example. Most of the basic technological components of the inter­
net were there in the 1980s. Versions of the internet itself—­a distributed 
packet-­switched system—­date back to the 1950s. But during this period 
of time, those things suddenly came together to form the World Wide 
Web, to revolutionize our communications, our media, and our global 
commerce.
We can debate what addition supersaturated the solution and precipi­
tated the crystal of transformative innovation—­Tim Berners-­Lee's archi­
tecture of HTML and the World Wide Web? The price, speed, and memory 
frontier that PCs hit in the early 1990s? The unused bandwidth available 
on cable networks' fiber backbones due to networks and "rights of way" 
property regimes created for an entirely different purpose? More likely, 
it is all of the above. Without any single great breakthrough, the world 
was suddenly dramatically different. The worldwide internet went from

being a science fiction trope that was never going to exist ("flying cars!") 
to a reality in about five years. It became the reality—­an unquestioned 
feature of our world like gravity and oxygen—­in a mere 15. People who 
had predicted for decades that computers and networks would transform 
society, and faced entirely justified heckling when the promised revolu­
tion failed to appear, were wrong, wrong, wrong until they were suddenly 
and shockingly right. In 15 years, the world changed dramatically, with­
out warning and without some eureka discovery that might have been 
thought necessary to precipitate the transformation. All the technologies 
were well understood. The result was not. That incident is undeniably 
part of our past. And we think we can predict the future?
Why can this not happen with AI? I do not mean to say that it will, 
but confident assertions either way should be met with skepticism. Duke 
Law School's parking lot has some gratifyingly witty bumper stickers. 
One seems appropriate here. "Radical Agnostic" says the large, capitalized 
text. Underneath is the smaller punch line. "I don't know and you don't 
either!!" Perhaps this should be our motto for AI prognostication. Some 
may think, perhaps rightly, that I fail that test. I am going to argue that 
there are reasons to believe that progress is likely to be faster than many 
of us think. My agnosticism has a tilt. Nevertheless, I think the radical 
agnostic's motto is the right one.
If the internet's transformation seems too singular and unlikely to be 
representative, it is worth remembering that we have just lived through 
another example of this process of synchronistic change: the rapid pro­
liferation of neural network systems that rely on deep learning to recog­
nize speech in multiple languages, translate sentences, identify pictures, 
predict consumer desires, and so on. How did this happen? The origins 
of electronic neural networks can be found as far back as the 1940s and 
1950s.14 A cluster of events had to come together to produce the leap for­
ward of the last ten years. There were revolutionary breakthroughs in net­
work theory and design—­the software side. Continuous improvements 
in speed and drops in cost of hardware made those software advances 
suddenly have a much greater reach or potential. But wider cultural and 
technological transformations also played a role. Both the software and 
hardware showed what they could do because of an explosion of data on 
which they could be tested and proven.

CHAPTER 2
Combine the continuously improving technologies of the individual 
computer—­which is rapidly increasing in speed, processing power, and 
memory capacity while dropping in price—­with a global network of 
other computers doing the same thing and a cloud that is almost always 
in reach. Put those computers in people's pockets, as smartphones. Now 
we have nearly seven billion nodes connecting to the cloud around the 
planet, each performing a host of different tasks and running many dif­
ferent apps, and thus an exponential increase in the rate of data generation 
by those rapidly proliferating devices.
Millions of people navigate using Google Maps, upload and tag photo­
graphs, dictate commands to their phones, and then correct that dictation, 
providing feedback to the system. The torrent of data is staggering—­"big 
data," indeed. And in that data are patterns, patterns that artificial intelli­
gence can "learn" to identify. Rather than programming the system with 
rules up-­front—­"this is the shape of a cat," "when a British person says 
'bath' it sounds like this"—­the system uses an architecture very loosely 
emulating the organization of neurons in the brain, arranged in sequen­
tial layers of processing. Many such systems develop through a process of 
trial and error, giving greater weight to the input from those layers that 
improve the accuracy of predictions. Once programmed with goals and 
parameters, and in some cases with an initial curated data set, the system 
can perform this process on its own, layer after layer, developing its own 
credit-­assignment paths that lead to ever more precise identification in 
a process that may be partially inscrutable even to the original program­
mers. The system might even be given almost no guidance and simply 
rewarded through deep reinforcement learning when it does something 
its programmers think is good. This technique has consistently outper­
formed more structured, choreographed approaches to the problems 
machine intelligence must solve.
Look at the number of technological developments that come together 
to make this happen. It is not simply a matter of Moore's law, which 
skeptics rightly point out is no longer empirically accurate. Deep learn­
ing depends on dramatic changes in memory capacity, price, distributed 
storage, number of users, and advances in artificial intelligence theory 
and software. It turns those advances onto the firehose of data generated 
by our computer systems. And the neural network uses deep learning,

71
rather than some formal set of preprogrammed rules, to master this tor­
rent of data. Peter Norvig, the Director of Research at Google and a lead­
ing scholar of artificial intelligence, puts it nicely: "We decided that the 
best model of the world was the world."15
Deep learning has been a revolutionary development.16 Google Trans­
late became dramatically better literally overnight. Image-­ or speech-­
recognition software was suddenly vastly more accurate. For all of this, 
you have deep learning, and probably neural networks, to thank. What 
does this tell us about the prospects of General AI? By itself, not much at 
all. True, this is one type of artificial intelligence, focused on discrete tasks, 
but it is not General AI, let alone consciousness, unless your threshold 
for consciousness is "can you identify all the cute little kitty cats in this 
picture?" Large language models such as ChatGPT or LaMDA are such sys­
tems. Blake Lemoine, the Google engineer whose story began this book, 
was so convinced by LaMDA's output that he believed it had become con­
scious. Lemoine was incorrect: there is no ghost in that machine, merely 
jaw-­droppingly brilliant imposture.
The story of deep learning, and of Lemoine's error, do not teach us that 
General AI is here, or that machine learning systems like LaMDA or Chat­
GPT are going to become conscious tomorrow. Instead, they should teach 
us something very different: that it is very hard to forecast developments 
in technologies, some of which are developing at exponential rates, when 
it is the interaction of the rapidly changing components of the system that 
enables the dramatic, paradigm-­shifting change. The point is that sudden 
and unexpected change is possible, though not inevitable, whether from 
exponential growth within one field or syncretic fusion among many. 
That suggests we might want to take seriously the arguments of those 
who think that Artificial General Intelligence may arrive sooner than we 
think, even if we are skeptical of their precise timetable, or their predic­
tions of rapturous immortality or machine-­led annihilation. We need not 
rely on their arguments as descriptions of what will happen and when. 
We can think of them as reasonable suggestions of what could happen, 
and why.
Perhaps an anecdote will underline that point. As I was writing these

networks, had resigned from Google so that he could speak more freely

CHAPTER 2
about his concerns over AI systems. This was not exactly like Thomas 
Edison quitting his job because he was worried about the effects of light­
bulbs but, for many in the field, it produced an equivalent level of shock. 
To be clear, Hinton's concerns about the breakneck pace of technological 
development around AI systems are broad ones. He instanced everything 
from the rampant production of deep fakes to the effect on the labor 
market, warfare, and political stability. But I was struck by one thing he 
said: "The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people—­a 
few people believed that. . . . But most people thought it was way off. And 
I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer 
away. Obviously, I no longer think that."17 He is not alone in this belief. 
Google's DeepMind is without doubt one of the most important com­
panies in the field. Its research has been vital to current breakthroughs, 
including those by rival companies. The same month as Hinton's resigna­
tion, DeepMind's CEO Demis Hassabis had this to say: "The progress in 
the last few years has been pretty incredible, I don't see any reason why 
that progress is going to slow down. I think it may even accelerate. So, I 
think we could be just a few years, maybe within a decade, away [from 
human-­level AI]."18
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? WHEN?
This brings us to the obvious question: Will General-­Purpose, or even 
conscious, AI arrive at all, and if so, when? It turns out that those study­
ing AI have radically different answers to those questions. They differ 
about the most promising lines of research, their difficulty, and the 
extent to which industry and academic research scientists will actually be 
focused on Artificial General Intelligence rather than on building many 
discrete artificial intelligence systems that make hair appointments, book 
your travel, or organize your photo album. But they also differ on the two 
axes just identified: optimism or pessimism about sustained exponential 
growth and optimism or pessimism about the frequency and significance 
of technological synchronicity—­the coming together of many factors to 
produce a leap forward that was not predictable in advance.
These forms of optimism and pessimism are shared in the discussion 
of economic growth more generally, of course. Tyler Cowen's The Great

Stagnation19 and Robert Gordon's The Rise and Fall of American Growth20 
both provide compelling arguments against the assumption that we will 
continue to have the kind of robust economic growth, year after year, 
that characterized much of the twentieth century, though Cowen is actu­
ally more optimistic.21 But the AI debates present a particularly hard puz­
zle for prediction because we have glaring examples of remarkable, and 
in some cases exponential, rates of technological advance. Yet we also 
have repeated, humility-­inducing difficulties and failures. After all, some 
problems that AI scientists at first thought were fairly basic (teaching a 
computer "common sense," for example) have proven remarkably hard 
to solve:
A.I. "recognizes objects, but can't explain what it sees. It can't read a textbook 
and understand the questions in the back of the book," said Oren Etzioni, a 
former University of Washington professor who oversees the Allen Institute for 
Artificial Intelligence. "It is devoid of common sense." Success may require years 
or even decades of work—­if it comes at all. Others have tried to digitize common 
sense, and the task has always proved too large. In the mid-­1980s, Doug Lenat, 
a former Stanford University professor, with backing from the government and 
several of the country's largest tech companies, started a project called Cyc. He 
and his team of researchers worked to codify all the simple truths that we learn 
as children, from "you can't be in two places at the same time" to "when drink­
ing from a cup, hold the open end up." Thirty years later, Mr. Lenat and his 
team are still at work on this "common sense engine"—­with no end in sight.22
That skepticism could be strengthened by a series of disagreements 
in the field about the best methods for developing even discrete expert 
systems, let alone Artificial General Intelligence. Should AI be neat or 
scruffy? Neat approaches are based on some overarching framework such 
as symbolic logic, and they use that framework to solve every problem. 
Scruffy approaches, by contrast, opportunistically use different cognitive 
techniques to solve different problems so that the method for translating 
from one language to another might be different than the method for 
image recognition or playing chess, and much might consist of ad hoc, 
individually coded heuristics based on real-­world experience. Should or 
will AI be rule governed, based on an enormously complex but finite set 
of algorithms laid down at the start by its designers? Alternatively, will 
it be partially autonomous, "learning" how to achieve tasks in ways that 
may be inscrutable to the original creators? Will it be based on advances

CHAPTER 2
in the logical dissection of how humans actually think or on the pursuit 
of rational problem-­solving, regardless of how humans think? Something 
else altogether? If the AI optimists cannot even tell us what methods will 
yield General AI, then how can their optimism be sustained?
Reflecting the number of questions to be answered, surveys of AI 
researchers have shown considerable divergence in predictions of when 
General AI, or something like it, would be achieved. One notable 2016 
survey23 used as its target population all of the researchers who published 
at two of the most important conferences in the field and asked, among 
other things, when high-­level machine intelligence would be achieved. 
Their definition of such intelligence was a demanding one: "High-­level 
machine intelligence (HLMI) is achieved when unaided machines can 
accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers."24 
Note that this definition, like any we might choose, will have dramatic 
effects on the outcomes. For example, we might want to know when 
the first example of General AI could be achieved if we were willing to 
put Manhattan Project-­level resources into it, not when every doctor, 
novelist, lawyer, composer, and kindergarten teacher could be replaced 
by a better, and cheaper, cybernetic equivalent. Alternatively, if our con­
cerns were with the question of when there might be some moral claim 
to legal personhood, we might think it irrelevant whether the AI could 
do brain surgery or dance ballet, just as long as we felt its consciousness 
shared enough with our own to warrant such a claim. The advantage 
of the question the researchers posed is that it looks formalizable and 
falsifiable, avoiding philosophical debates about whether true conscious­
ness had been or ever could be achieved. That is also its disadvantage. 
Still, given both its universality of field and its price constraint—­every task 
humans can do, in every case, done cheaper—­it presents a very demand­
ing standard.
The aggregate forecast was that there was about a 30 percent chance 
of achieving high-­level machine intelligence within about 25 years (as 
of 2016) and a 50 percent chance of achieving it within 45 years. The 
researchers reported a striking demographic split in responses: "Asian 
respondents expect HLMI within 30 years, whereas North Americans 
expect it in 74 years." Interestingly, the aggregate forecast suggested there 
was a 10 percent chance that it might be achieved within nine years of

2016, that is by 2025! Kurzweil's view is still an outlier, but it falls, or fell, 
within the bounds of the profession.
As of August 2022, Metaculus, the online prediction site, was fore­
casting that we would have Artificial General Intelligence by November 
2041.25 Their criteria for Artificial General Intelligence were different 
than the survey above; as I mentioned before, the system had to be able 
to perform well on tests assessing varied skills ranging from a two-­hour 
adversarial Turing Test, featuring text and images, to the assembly of a 
complex model car. By May 2023, their assessment had changed. "The 
Metaculus community currently expects [Artificial General Intelligence] 
to be unveiled in October 2031." The influential AI thinker Eliezer Yud­
kowsky showed equal optimism about the speed of the transformation, 
coupled with extreme pessimism about its results. He accepted the fol­
lowing bet from Bryan Caplan: "Bryan Caplan pays Eliezer $100 now, in 
exchange for $200 CPI-­adjusted from Eliezer if the world has not been 
ended by nonaligned AI before 12:00am GMT on January 1st, 2030."26
On the other end of the spectrum from the Singularists are skeptics 
who find these predictions wildly optimistic (or pessimistic, depending 
on what you think General AI will do when it arrives). Rodney Brooks, a 
former director of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence 
Laboratory, and the founder of iRobot, the company that makes your 
Roomba, has been a frequent critic of overconfident predictions. He 
claims they are characterized by a pattern of fallacies. They predict consis­
tent exponential rates of technological growth rather than a regression to 
the mean. They use trivial accomplishments (iPhoto recognizing all the 
photos of your lover's face) as evidence for the idea that qualitative trans­
formations (General AI) are close at hand. Finally, they make firm techno­
logical projections when the timescale means that neither the technology 
nor the state of the world in which that technology will be deployed 
can accurately be predicted.27 Brooks pointedly rejects Kurzweil's claims, 
and some of his own projections put human-­level AI much further in 
the future: "It will be well over 100 years before we see this level in our 
machines. Maybe many hundred years."28 Interestingly, though, it is the 
optimistic time-­horizon and suddenness suggested by the proponents of 
the Singularity that Brooks doubts, not the eventual achievement itself. 
Instead, he imagines a gradual process of improvement, "generation by

generation by generation. The singularity will be a period, not an event." 
We will be driven, he thinks, "not by the imperative of the singularity 
itself but by the usual economic and sociological forces. Eventually, we 
will create truly artificial intelligences, with cognition and consciousness 
recognizably similar to our own."29
Why is Brooks so confident, given that he is generally a skeptic of opti­
mistic AI claims? The reason is simple. We are learning more and more 
about the neurological processes of the brain. What we can understand, 
we can hope eventually to replicate:
I, you, our family, friends, and dogs—­we all are machines. We are really sophis­
ticated machines made up of billions and billions of biomolecules that interact 
according to well-­defined, though not completely known, rules deriving from 
physics and chemistry. The biomolecular interactions taking place inside our 
heads give rise to our intellect, our feelings, our sense of self. Accepting this 
hypothesis opens up a remarkable possibility. If we really are machines and if—­
this is a big if—­we learn the rules governing our brains, then in principle there's 
no reason why we shouldn't be able to replicate those rules in, say, silicon and 
steel. I believe our creation would exhibit genuine human-­level intelligence, 
emotions, and even consciousness.30
This is not the most likely method of achieving General AI, far from it. 
Think of Brooks's postulate as an upper bound in AI research—­one way of 
conceiving of the problem that indicates General AI must be achievable, 
if incredibly hard. We have a model of a functioning consciousness: us.
Some will believe that, by divine command, consciousness can only 
be created by the deity, not by human hands and minds. Perhaps there 
is some as-­yet-­undiscovered emergent property of natural biological 
brains that cannot be reproduced, even if replicated perfectly, either in 
silico or even in some biological computational device. Others believe 
that consciousness is, in some strange way, prior to material reality—­the 
substrate on which the observable physical universe depends—­though 
this still begs the question of whether machines could have the requisite 
consciousness. But barring a divine or technologically intractable limit—­
some neurological equivalent of the light-­speed barrier—­eventually we 
will be able to recreate the relevant aspects of our brains and hence our 
consciousness. Having done that, we might be able to transcend some 
of the human brain's limitations in terms of speed, memory capacity,

embedded knowledge base, and networked communication of thought. 
Starting with a model based on a physical brain we could create ever 
more capable forms of general, conscious Artificial Intelligence. This is 
extremely unlikely to be the way we would achieve General AI. In fact, 
it might be the hardest and the one that would take the most time. But 
reconceived this way, the problem becomes a material and a soluble one. 
And Brooks, remember, is a skeptic.
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HARDWARE(?)
Writers on AI agree that neither the range of predictions nor the fact that 
the due date keeps getting bumped forward induce confidence. In his 
seminal 1993 article, Vinge acknowledges this fact when making his own 
prediction. "I believe that the creation of greater than human intelligence 
will occur during the next thirty years. (Charles Platt has pointed out that 
AI enthusiasts have been making claims like this for the last thirty years. 
Just so I'm not guilty of a relative-­time ambiguity, let me more specific: 
I'll be surprised if this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030.)"31 This 
aside became known as Platt's Law: those making predictions about Gen­
eral AI will place its inception date roughly 30 years in the future from 
the date the prediction was made.
Is there some less-­subjective basis on which we could predict General 
AI? Are there metrics that would provide us a benchmark for progress? 
One answer is that we do not need to replicate the specific architecture 
of the brain but rather to emulate, in silicon or its successors, all of the 
relevant capacities and capabilities of a brain—­the amount of memory it 
can hold, how fast it can solve problems, and so on. (Hal, the imaginary 
computer from the introduction, achieved sentience when the number of 
connections in his neural networks hit a number that approximated that 
of a human brain. But that was a thought experiment. There is no reason 
to think this is the relevant metric.) Once we have equivalent hardware, 
goes the theory, we only need to tweak the software, and voila, General 
AI! But where are we in terms of comparative capabilities? And what is 
the historical rate of change? In 2011, eons ago in internet time, Scientific 
American ran the article "Computers versus Brains":

CHAPTER 2
For decades computer scientists have strived to build machines that can calcu­
late faster than the human brain and store more information. The contraptions 
have won. The world's most powerful supercomputer, the K from Fujitsu, com­
putes four times faster and holds 10 times as much data. And of course, many 
more bits are coursing through the Internet at any moment. Yet the Internet's 
servers worldwide would fill a small city, and the K sucks up enough electric­
ity to power 10,000 homes. The incredibly efficient brain consumes less juice 
than a dim lightbulb and fits nicely inside our head. Biology does a lot with a 
little: the human genome, which grows our body and directs us through years 
of complex life, requires less data than a laptop operating system. Even a cat's 
brain smokes the newest iPad—­1,000 times more data storage and a million 
times quicker to act on it.32
All of these figures, except those claimed for the brain, which are prob­
lematic for other reasons, are now out of date, of course. The 2011 Scien­
tific American article claims that the K supercomputer could then perform 
8.2 petaflops or 8.2 quadrillion (8.2 x 1015) floating-­point operations per 
second. That was a marked advance from earlier computers. As late as 
2008, IBM's Blue Gene, the fastest supercomputer at the time, was just 
above 1 petaflops. By contrast, the Frontier, the fastest supercomputer 
as of 2023, can perform 1194 petaflops, 145 times faster than the K and 
1100 times faster than the Blue Gene. From the Blue Gene to the Frontier, 
processing speed doubled approximately every 18 months. While this 
may not exactly be exponential growth, it is a startling rate of improve­
ment. And this comparative hardware approach leads people other than 
proponents of the Singularity to be fairly optimistic about how soon Gen­
eral AI will arrive. To quote Nick Bostrom, the Oxford University profes­
sor whose book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies warns of the 
dangers rather than the promise of AI:
Hardware-­wise, the brain still compares favorably with machines. Estimates 
vary, but perhaps the cortex performs something like 1016 or 1018 operations 
per second using 20 watts, which is impressive. Eventually, the limits of com­
putation in machine substrate are of course far beyond those in biological tis­
sue, and it shouldn't take too long to reach rough equivalence. The advance of 
algorithms is harder to predict, but the notion that we could have human-­level 
AI within a small number of decades seems credible, though there is great uncer­
tainty on both the lower and upper sides of this estimate.33
Bostrom's estimate of the brain's capacity is higher than that of the 
Scientific American article. The authors of that piece estimated the brain

79
could perform 2 petaflops. Bostrom seems to assume that it can perform 
somewhere between 10 and 1,000. Jürgen Schmidhuber, scientific direc­
tor of a leading Swiss AI Lab and a machine learning pioneer, is also opti­
mistic about the arrival of General AI. His optimism is based not just on 
the absolute speed of the very fastest machines but on the falling price of 
the average machine:
When will we have computers as capable as the brain? Soon. Every five years 
computing is getting roughly 10 times cheaper. Unlike Moore's Law, which says 
that the number of transistors per microchip doubles every 18 months (and 
which recently broke) this older trend has held since Konrad Zuse built the first 
working program-­controlled computer. His machine could perform roughly one 
floating-­point operation per second. Today, 75 years later, hardware is roughly 
a million billion times faster per unit price. Soon we'll have cheap devices with 
the raw computational power of a human brain; a few decades later, of all 10 bil­
lion human brains together, which collectively probably cannot execute more 
than 1030 meaningful elementary operations per second.34
The Open Philanthropy Project, an effective altruism nonprofit, has 
funded a lot of research on the possible impact of AI. In 2020 they com­
missioned a report on when we might have human-­level AI. The author 
of that report,35 Ajeya Cotra, found a 10 percent chance by 2031, a 50 
percent chance by 2052, and an almost 80 percent chance by 2100. She 
used a number of methods, including the "floating-­point operations in 
the brain" analysis we have just been discussing. She even attempted, 
as one benchmark, to estimate the number of floating-­point operations 
represented by the entire history of biological evolution toward humans. 
It is as if we saw biological evolution as a moonshot AI project trying to 
achieve human consciousness and could extrapolate from that how long 
it would take machines affordably to replicate that evolutionary path. 
Cotra then adjusted the sum of all of these predictive models and the 
median fell on, specifically, 2052, or 32 years after the report was pub­
lished. A cynic might say that Platt's Law still holds! Two years later, Cotra 
adjusted her median prediction to 2040 because of unexpectedly good 
performance on a number of benchmarks since 2020.36
But what do all these numbers actually mean? A critic might say 
that they are fundamentally misleading. Human beings do not think in 
floating-­point operations. You can indeed calculate 1.37 times 8.91, but 
I am fairly sure you don't do it in a single second, still less in a millionth

CHAPTER 2
or billionth of a second. Nor do we conceive of the activities of recogniz­
ing a face, realizing your marinade needs more ponzu, or writing a love 
poem as involving floating-­point operations at all. Is using this number 
to compare the power of a brain and a computer like using miles per hour 
to quantify Shakespeare's prose? To paraphrase Norvig and Russell's book 
Artificial Intelligence, we do not compare the albatross and the 747 by ask­
ing how quickly each flaps its wings. They achieve flight using different 
techniques and, barring the attempt to replicate the brain neuron by neu­
ron, the same will be true of an attempt at building General AI.
Are these comparisons useless, then? Despite the criticisms I just 
pointed out, as long as they are taken with an appropriate degree of cau­
tion, such comparisons do help illuminate something useful. Any attempt 
to create General AI is aided by having more capable, faster, cheaper, 
smaller computers, which can handle more complex sets of instructions, 
contain more memory, form networks more easily, and so on.
In the past, artificial intelligence researchers have found that increases 
in speed mean problems that were once thought to require elegant solu­
tions may in fact be solved by brute-­force approaches. For example, we 
might think the only way to teach a computer to play chess is by elabo­
rately programming software rules that outline strategy and tactics. Or 
perhaps just to have the computer teach itself by playing millions or bil­
lions of games, generating its own rules and strategies, using a technique 
called deep reinforcement learning. When I interviewed Hal Abelson, 
a renowned computer scientist at MIT, he told me that "problems that 
people thought could only be solved elegantly are instead being solved 
by simple techniques of reinforcement learning."
One of the most powerful examples of reinforcement learning is pro­
vided by the development of DeepMind's Go-­playing system. The game 
of Go has vastly more permutations than chess: "As simple as the rules 
may seem, Go is profoundly complex. There are an astonishing 10 to 
the power of 170 possible board configurations—­more than the number 
of atoms in the known universe. This makes the game of Go a googol 
times more complex than chess."37 With a game this mind-­numbingly 
complicated, it would seem that any AI would have to emulate human 
strategies of intuition and pattern recognition and would have to rely

on the tactical heuristics polished by generations of players—­or not. 
The researchers at Google's DeepMind project created a program called 
AlphaGo, which went on to beat the best human players in the world. 
The first version of AlphaGo was "trained by supervised learning from 
human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-­play." 
These techniques rely on a curated dataset and an initially supervised 
interaction with that dataset. That is still far less direction, far less pro­
grammed strategy, than researchers had previously believed would be 
necessary. Yet the results of its victorious contests with human grand 
masters were remarkable: "During the games, AlphaGo played a handful 
of highly inventive winning moves, several of which—­including move 
37 in game two—­were so surprising they overturned hundreds of years 
of received wisdom, and have since been examined extensively by play­
ers of all levels. In the course of winning, AlphaGo somehow taught the 
world completely new knowledge about perhaps the most studied and 
contemplated game in history."
To find the limits of deep reinforcement learning, the researchers cre­
ated a second version of the program, called AlphaGo Zero,
based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or 
domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a 
neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also 
the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of 
the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-­
play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero 
achieved superhuman performance, winning 100-­0 against the previously pub­
lished, champion-­defeating AlphaGo.38
In the words of the AlphaGo Zero team: "This technique [of reinforce­
ment learning without human guidance] is more powerful than previ­
ous versions of AlphaGo because it is no longer constrained by the limits of 
human knowledge."39
To be clear, AlphaGo Zero is not General AI or anything remotely 
close to it. It also was not achieved solely because of hardware advances; 
the researchers at DeepMind are justifiably proud of their astonishing 
accomplishment in both software and neural architecture design. Chat­
GPT would not exist without those advances, which the DeepMind teams

CHAPTER 2
shared widely. But the increase in speed, memory, and data-­handling 
capacity that I described earlier opens entirely new possible lines of 
research. Neural networks, deep learning, and reinforcement learning 
show that we can achieve striking results at tasks previously thought to 
play to human strengths, such as facial recognition or intuitive strategy 
games, without attempting precisely to emulate the patterns of human 
thought.
What does this tell us? There is no one-­to-­one map of human and 
machine capability; at least at the moment, both the hardware and soft­
ware are very different. Thus, the head-­to-­CPU comparisons of processing 
capabilities are wildly approximate at best. But if one trims away the 
hyperbole about operations per second, and number of neural connec­
tions, a truth remains. While we do not know what the crucial dimen­
sions of hardware performance will be in eventually achieving General 
AI, the rate of progress on every dimension of performance suggests that 
Bostrom and Schmidhuber have reason for their qualified optimism. As 
with military strategy, greater resources mean more angles of attack, some 
of them previously unforeseen.
Kurzweil, of course, believes that General AI is much closer: "When 
will we have computers as capable as the brain? I believe computers will 
match and then quickly exceed human capabilities in the areas where 
humans are still superior today by 2029."40 Yudkowsky, in his pessimism, 
seems to believe that there is a significant danger of us achieving General 
AI not long after that date. From my discussions with AI researchers, I 
find this prediction unlikely, though some of them have become decid­
edly more optimistic recently. But I find equally puzzling those who claim 
confidently we are centuries away. The graph of technological change 
may not be vertical, but it is steep and punctuated by unforeseen leaps 
forward, sometimes driven by the synchronicity of multiple technologies 
unexpectedly coming together, sometimes by new approaches that har­
ness rapidly evolving speed and big data capabilities, and sometimes by 
theoretical breakthroughs. At the very least, I think we can be confident 
of this: long before the century is out, we will have AI at a level where its 
consciousness is, at least, a matter on which well-­informed people can, 
and will, reasonably disagree. The controversy will be live. Indeed, some 
would argue we are already there. And that is all I need.

EVEN IF IT WORKS, IS IT CONSCIOUS?
If one challenge to General AI is that it is impossible, or will take hun­
dreds of years to achieve, a second and more fundamental challenge goes 
to ontology rather than technology: the nature of being, not the likelihood 
of working. Even if a computer-­based Artificial Intelligence could do any­
thing a human could do, would we think it was alive, aware, and thus 
perhaps a person? After all, it is just a machine. It is doing only what it 
has been programmed to do. It might replicate our responses with perfect 
fidelity, but would it be conscious while doing so or merely parroting 
lines programmed by others, like Siri "remembering" your birthday and 
congratulating you on it? Let us begin with Alan Turing and his critics.
In "Computing Machinery and Intelligence,"41 Turing poses the ques­
tion, "can machines think"? He then quickly suggests substituting for 
that question, which he calls "meaningless," another one: Can an inter­
rogator distinguish between a human being and a machine on the basis 
of their typed answers to the interrogator's questions? Turing's reasons 
for proposing this substitution are not exactly clear. He says that it "has 
the advantage of drawing a fairly sharp line between the physical and 
the intellectual capacities of a man." He says that one alternative method 
of answering the question "can machines think?"—­by looking at the 
ordinary language meaning of "machine" and "think"—­is "absurd" and 
would lead to answering the question "by Gallup poll." He also attempts 
to refute a long list of objections to his alternative question—­theological, 
mathematical, that it would not reflect true consciousness, even the 
assumed absence of extrasensory perception in machines. Then he con­
cludes with disarming openness, "I have no very convincing arguments 
of a positive nature to support my views. If I had I should not have taken 
such pains to point out the fallacies in contrary views." Despite that mod­
est disclaimer, Turing's Imitation Game has achieved considerable fame; 
it is now simply called the Turing Test. Should the Turing Test also be 
the moral or constitutional test for legal personhood? Many humans—­
babies, those in a coma, even those who are neurodivergent—­might fail 
the Turing Test but are undoubtedly persons.42 But for those who are 
nonhuman, would the ability to imitate human consciousness act as the 
doorway to legal personhood?

CHAPTER 2
The Turing Test has a lot going for it. It is relatively simple. It promises 
a determinate answer—­a huge advantage—­and one that seems designed 
to avoid our prejudices in favor of our own kind. The interrogator is not 
exactly behind a veil of ignorance, but she is attempting to deal directly 
with mind rather than body in a way that recalls other moments in the 
history of civil rights when we have been told not to focus on surface 
appearances. It is, as lawyers say, "formally realizable"—­capable of being 
formulated in a test that a court or a decision maker could apply in a 
replicable way.
There would be questions about what the criteria of that test should 
be, of course. How long a conversation and under what conditions? What 
would be the standard of proof? What qualities would the conversation 
have to touch on and what qualities—­imagination, humor, spirituality, 
morality, empathy—­would it probe for? Nevertheless, at the end of the 
day it is something that seems more amenable to being formalized as a 
test than many other benchmarks of consciousness. Why? Because it seeks 
to convert normative judgment into statistical fact, using an "innocent" 
audience for greater impartiality. We do this in other areas. Want to know 
if a trademark presents a likelihood of confusion with another mark? The 
law has elaborate, albeit psychologically flawed, rules for statistically test­
ing likely confusion with sample audiences. The Turing Test would be 
harder and more contentious to implement as a legal procedure, but it 
could look like a legal test, and that fact is significant—­perhaps more 
than it should be. The test also presents, albeit implicitly, a challenge to 
our privileged position in the hierarchy of beings: If you cannot distinguish 
me from a human, who are you to say I am not a person?
The most famous objection to the Turing Test comes from the phi­
losopher John Searle,43 who argues that effective mimicry does not in 
any sense imply the kind of consciousness or understanding we expect as 
a hallmark of thought. Searle uses the analogy of the Chinese Room—­a 
man inside a room who does not understand Chinese but who is given an 
elaborate set of rules about what Chinese characters to hand back when 
handed characters of a particular shape. Searle's point is that those instruc­
tions might be extremely complicated, and the resulting "conversation" 
might seem to be a substantive one, yet in no way would the actions of 
the man inside the room represent consciousness or understanding in

communication. It would merely be rule-­following based on a character­
istic (i.e., the shape of the characters) completely separate from the actual 
internal meaning of the words in the conversation. As a description of 
LaMDA, and an explanation of Blake Lemoine's mistaken attribution of 
personhood to it, this seems right on point.
But Searle's objection goes deeper. He is not just saying that machines 
programmed to pass the Turing Test are not conscious since the goal is 
mimicry rather than comprehension as an interior state. He is saying that 
machines of any kind could not be conscious. Sometimes this seems to 
be because, as he says, "[c]onsciousness is a biological phenomenon like 
photosynthesis, digestion or mitosis."44 Sometimes it seems to be because 
he conceives of machines or artifacts as entities that are inherently oper­
ating according to a completely different set of rules than humans, pro­
grammed artifacts that have only mastered syntax as opposed to beings 
that also understand content and meaning, that is, semantics. In fact, 
those latter points seem to be definitional for him, part of the very classi­
fications of "machine" and "programmed" rather than a contingent his­
torical judgment about our current machines and methods of AI research. 
The contrasting position would be someone who believes that while we 
often get our artifacts to do things largely through methods of rule-­based 
instruction—­programming in the derogatory sense—­from which con­
sciousness could not spring, one could imagine different emergent prop­
erties arising from neural networks, say, evolving entirely differently in 
the future.
Most of the time, Searle's arguments are a combination of those last 
two claims: (1) consciousness is a biological property; and (2) program­
ming cannot equal thought, no matter how precisely it mimics it.
The objection from consciousness is actually one that Turing responds 
to quite extensively in his original paper. He points out cogently that 
since we do not have direct evidence of the mental states of other human 
beings, we could always solipsistically posit them to be rule-­following 
automata:
I think that most of those who support the argument from consciousness could 
be persuaded to abandon it rather than be forced into the solipsist position. 
They will then probably be willing to accept our test. I do not wish to give the 
impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. There is, for

CHAPTER 2
instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. 
But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can 
answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper.45
To put it another way, Turing's point is that it is no easier to prove the 
existence of some freestanding, nonbiologically determined entity called 
mind or consciousness in human beings than in computers. This is a sim­
ilar point to the one Samuel Butler and B. F. Skinner made. In Skinner's 
words: "[T]he real question is not whether machines think but whether 
men do. The mystery which surrounds a thinking machine already sur­
rounds a thinking man."46 Faced with the metaphysical difficulties of 
that move, therefore, is it not easier to look for something we can mea­
sure, namely the pragmatic evidence provided by the ability to engage 
in convincing unstructured communication with another human being?
In effect, Turing raises the stakes: Are you sure you aren't just a com­
plicated Chinese Room? If you cannot prove otherwise, who are you to 
deny consciousness to your silicon brethren by imposing a higher burden 
of proof on them? In terms of constitutional law and popular debate, 
however, the answer to the last question is likely to be, "We're the enti­
ties who wrote the United States Constitution, that's who." For better 
or worse (actually, for better and worse), our law and legal culture will 
probably begin by assuming the reality of human consciousness and per­
sonhood while demanding higher levels of proof from artificially cre­
ated entities who seek similar constitutional status. At least at first, our 
politics and moral culture will probably do the same, and not without 
reason. After all, while Turing's argument has an attractive "sauce for the 
silicon goose is sauce for the organic gander" quality to it, it does not 
directly respond to our experience of consciousness, which is surely cen­
trally important, even if not dispositive.
How can we prove we are conscious? Most of us would likely respond 
with some version of Descartes's first premise: cogito, ergo sum, I think, 
therefore I am. I experience myself as thinking, as having consciousness, 
as having a self that, even though it changes, nonetheless recognizably 
has continuity with the "me's" of time past, "me's" whom I remember 
with occasional wistful fondness and frequent baffled exasperation. Hav­
ing had that experience, it would be silly for me to doubt that you, so 
much like me, have it too. For the solipsist, or the Skinnerian behaviorist,

this may be an unwarranted leap of sentimental faith. For the rest of us, 
it does not seem so. When it comes to Hal or the Chimpy, I lack at least 
some of that existentially grounded sense of the kinship of conscious 
beings. If anything is going to bridge the gap between us, it is reason—­
reason that is prone to be tilted toward skepticism or belief by the kind of 
priming I described in the discussion of Blade Runner.
The philosopher Daniel Dennett once called Searle's Chinese Room 
thought experiment "an intuition pump," and so it is, for both good and 
ill. On the positive side, it forces us to confront the philosophical ques­
tion of how something like Hal could possibly have the interior sense 
of consciousness that is our own primary experience of that state and 
to grapple with the difference between mimicry and meaning. On the 
negative side, or at least the less-­examined side, it does seem to assume its 
conclusion. Does it not rest on the postulate that our biologically based 
consciousness is unique and could never be replicated by an artifactual, 
programmed entity? Yet is that not the question we are trying to answer?
We know that we were formed by evolution. We know that early forms 
of life had particular clusters of cells that responded to pleasant and 
unpleasant stimuli, and they successfully passed on those genes. We know 
that those clusters of cells became increasingly complex. They might 
have begun by merely registering hot or cold, food source or poison, but 
they went on to enable evolutionarily successful tools like task-­solving 
intelligence, language, the ability to imagine vivid, sometimes illusory 
futures and try to create them. But along with those obviously instrumen­
tal skills came evolutionarily successful social ones: the grooming, nurtur­
ing, threat-­posturing, status-­seeking, and obsessive hierarchy-­measuring 
of social animals in tribes. Ah, Washington, DC. Ah, Hollywood. Ah, aca­
demia. We know that at some point, out of all this came a being that 
could think the thoughts of Butler or Searle or you, dear reader, as well as 
the moody teenager trying to figure out how one can possibly be Goth 
in Hawaii. (I have seen such an attempt: it was simultaneously absurd 
and moving. Also, warm.) From clusters of cells to consciousness in all 
its glory and self-­parodying absurdity—­that's quite the journey. It looks a 
little implausible from this end of the telescope, doesn't it?
Start at the end of that journey and the beginning looks laughably 
primitive. How could those blind clusters of cells eventually yield a

CHAPTER 2
Shakespeare or a W. H. Auden or a brave, burning spirit like Sojourner 
Truth? The enemies of evolution used exactly this technique to discredit 
it. It seems worth remembering that they were wrong. When Bishop Wil­
berforce, only somewhat apocryphally, is supposed to have asked the 
brilliant young biologist T. H. Huxley whether "it was through his grand­
father or his grandmother that he claimed descent from a monkey"?47 
he was making exactly that argumentative move. How could conscious­
ness emerge from such lowly beginnings, let alone from a mere cluster of 
cells? Of course, one could make the opposite argument from the same 
premise. The nematode is merely a cluster of stimuli and responses. The 
nematode is not conscious. We are just complex nematodes. Therefore, 
we are not conscious. This is a version of the fallacy of composition. That 
is why Butler's quote, at the very beginning of this chapter, has the punch 
that it does.
That train of thought leads us back to Searle. Given that we could and 
did go wrong about the possibility of the evolution of consciousness in 
biological beings, should we not be skeptical when someone uses exactly 
the same pattern of reasoning to deprecate the possible consciousness of 
nonbiological beings? Could no programming of any kind enable the 
man in the room, or possibly the system formed by the man, the room, 
and the plan, to speak Chinese with intentionality, rather than simply 
following rules, empty of meaning? Sure, that is what large language 
models like ChatGPT do, but Searle's claim is broader, that no machine 
could ever be conscious. Why? Why is our consciousness unique and 
incapable of machine replication?
In a useful essay, Dennett outlines three possible reasons, all of which 
he strongly contests:
1.	 Robots are purely material things, and consciousness requires immaterial 
mind-­stuff. (Old-­fashioned dualism.) . . .
2.	 Robots are inorganic (by definition), and consciousness can exist only in an 
organic brain. . . .
3.	 Robots are artefacts, and consciousness abhors an artefact; only something 
natural, born not manufactured, could exhibit genuine consciousness.48
He dismisses the first one more or less out of hand:
[O]ver the centuries, every other phenomenon of initially "supernatural" 
mysteriousness has succumbed to an uncontroversial explanation within the

89
commodious folds of physical science. The "miracles" of life itself, and of repro­
duction, are now analyzed into the well-­known intricacies of molecular biology. 
Why should consciousness be any exception? Why should the brain be the only 
complex physical object in the universe to have an interface with another realm 
of being?49
To me, as to Huxley, this also seems obvious, or at least presumptively 
obvious. The burden of proof surely rests on the person claiming that 
their explanation of a phenomenon is exempt from the scientific princi­
ples underlying all our other explanations. I could explain my conscious­
ness with reference to the ebb and flow of the orgone energy flows and 
the intervention of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. But if no other phe­
nomena were explained that way, and my theory was unfalsifiable, the 
burden of persuasion I faced would be appropriately high.
It remains to be seen, though, whether the general public will agree 
with this materialist approach to the thing that makes us, us: conscious­
ness. This is something that will be extremely important when our society 
comes to confront the idea of legal personality for AI. Minds feel different 
from other physical phenomena. They are the only place where mean­
ing resides. True, there is also the realm of shared, historically transmit­
ted meaning we call culture, but culture means nothing without minds 
to experience, interpret, and contribute to it. Minds are where meaning 
lives. For all of us, materialist rationalists perhaps included, the barriers 
to more intuitive, poetic, or transcendental explanations are thus at their 
thinnest. That may explain some of the success of the Chinese Room as 
a thought experiment.
There may be some special pleading going on here, some exceptional­
ism that responds to the question, "Why are humans unique in having 
the capacity for consciousness?" with the confident if utterly question-­
begging intuition "Because they are human!" Remember the judges I 
mentioned in the introduction? "But they aren't human." "Rights are 
for humans." "Naturally born of woman." The people who have that 
intuition will turn to, in fact will eagerly embrace, philosophically more 
developed defenses of their intuition—­defenses like those offered by 
Searle. Searle's work is important, then, both as philosophy and as an 
abstract of the likely discussion points in the likely opinion pieces and 
talk shows of the future.

CHAPTER 2
In Searle, the entity called Hal (or the Hal that claims to be an entity) 
has found its Grand Inquisitor. That does not make him right.
This brings us to the second argument, that consciousness is a 
uniquely biological property. Since this is the very question we are try­
ing to resolve, this blank assertion fails to convince. It is not a circular 
argument, like Molière's doctor solemnly telling us that opium makes 
us sleepy because it contains a dormitive principle, but it does fail to 
answer the question presented. Why? Let me be clear, Searle's argument 
is a thought-­provoking one and of great historical importance in the AI 
debates. As to its basic point that mimicry does not equal meaning, and 
mastery of syntax does not imply a grasp of semantics, it is convincing. 
It may even demonstrate that an entire class of approaches to AI, based 
on particular patterned, mimetic kinds of reasoning, or "predict the next 
word" neural networks, could not give rise to the kind of consciousness 
we believe ourselves to have. Those last five words are important.
On the other hand, there is some undeniable hand-­waving involved 
in the claim that machines could never move beyond the Chinese Room. 
No matter how they were developed, how precisely they mirrored the 
structure of the human brain, or how their processes of reasoning devel­
oped (e.g., if the machine grew and learned from external sensory inputs 
like a child), Searle's claim is that the AI's "consciousness" will never be 
more than elaborate imposture. Those feeds from the cameras and micro­
phones are just more information flowing to the being inside the Chinese 
Room, inherently devoid of meaning. If we ask why, Searle's response is 
that "consciousness is a biological phenomenon like . . . mitosis."50 As an 
explanation of why consciousness is a uniquely biological phenomenon, 
this is a distinctly underwhelming answer, akin to the irritated parent's 
argument of last resort: because. Yes, now, the only conscious beings we 
have experience of are biological. But to explain why consciousness can 
arise only from biological processes in the future, no matter what tech­
nological form that consciousness takes, one needs more than an elegant 
parable about one type of programming that would lead to mimicry 
but not meaning and a blank assertion of biological exceptionalism and 
the primacy of experienced consciousness. Yet that is the assertion that 
Searle seems to make. We are a little too close to the evolution debates, 
to the blank assertion of human exceptionalism and the ridicule of the

91
idea that phase-­changing complexity might arise from the composition 
of individually more primitive, simple phenomena, to be comfortable 
nodding along.
One basis for Searle's assertion might be the third argument Dennett 
addresses: "Robots are artefacts, and consciousness abhors an artefact; 
only something natural, born not manufactured, could exhibit genu­
ine consciousness." But if all of these things, from neurons firing in my 
brain as I think about my sweetheart to convolutional neural nets in sili­
con artificial intelligence, are merely physical phenomena, why is my 
consciousness not as illusory? Why are my experiences not mere data 
streams? Searle's answer might surprise you:
Consciousness exists only insofar as it is experienced by a human or animal sub­
ject. OK, now grant me that consciousness is a genuine biological phenomenon. 
Well, all the same it's somewhat different from other biological phenomena 
because it only exists insofar as it is experienced. However, that does give it an 
interesting status. You can't refute the existence of consciousness by showing 
that it's just an illusion because the illusion/reality distinction rests on the dif­
ference between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are. But 
where the very existence of consciousness is concerned, if it consciously seems 
to me that I'm conscious, then I am conscious. You can't make the illusion/real­
ity distinction for the very existence of consciousness the way you can for sun­
sets and rainbows because the distinction is between how things consciously 
seem and how they really are.51
Ah. Thanks for clearing that up. Apparently, it is cogito, ergo sum all the 
way down.
I do not say this to scoff. As a basis for belief in our own existence, 
cogito, ergo sum seems as reasonable to me as it did to Descartes. It is 
hard for us even to assume otherwise. There is a frequently repeated story 
about a philosopher famous for his piercingly terse questions, Sidney 
Morgenbesser, who attended a talk by Skinner, one of the great behav­
iorists. Skinner argued that we are merely stimulus-­response machines 
and that consciousness is at best a functional illusion. There is no con­
scious ghost in the Skinner-­box machine inside our brains. "Ah, thank 
you, Professor Skinner," said Morgenbesser, "so if I understand you cor­
rectly, you are saying we are wrong to take an anthropomorphic approach 
to human beings."52 Burn. Cue laughter. Skinner's response is not recorded, 
and I am no behaviorist, but fairness requires me to point out that it

CHAPTER 2
could well have been, "that isn't my terminology, but essentially 'yes.' 
The fact that you think that is a ludicrous claim doesn't prove you right, 
any more than the fact that humans used to think the earth the center of 
the universe proved that they were correct." But can we do otherwise? Is 
our own bet on our own consciousness not a kind of obligatory Pascal's 
wager—­the philosopher who believes in God because if he is right, he 
gets heaven, and if he is wrong, he gets nothing, which is what he would 
have achieved anyway? Is this a bet we have to take because, otherwise, 
there is no "we" to do anything?
Let us concede that might be true. Or at least concede that, existen­
tially, it feels to most of us that we have to assume it is true. That is the 
intuition on which Searle trades so heavily in the passage above, effec­
tively making it immune from criticism. Nice work if you can get it, yet 
I can empathize. We are awake, alive, conscious; if we take that as a first 
premise, and our popular debate certainly will, we can hardly criticize 
Searle for doing the same. What is the next step? "Okay, now grant me 
that consciousness is a genuine biological phenomenon." Fine, though 
that is a leap whose magnitude Searle understates. Let us take that large 
second leap and say that my experience of consciousness and that of 
every conscious being I have encountered is due to biological phenom­
ena. Even given those two leaps, is that a basis to conclude confidently 
that nonbiological entities could not be conscious? That is a third unsup­
ported, or at least under-­supported, leap of faith. It is one that Searle 
brushes over just a little too fast.
When pushed on this point, Searle effectively takes Butler's narra­
tive in Erewhon and reverses it. Butler wanted to show how hard it was 
to predict the capacity for consciousness of potential physical systems 
advancing at a speed far beyond evolution. Searle, by contrast, delights in 
making the idea of conscious AI ludicrous by reducing the internal work­
ings of a neural net to physical operations we cannot possibly imagine 
yielding conscious results. He starts by conjuring a computer program 
designed to simulate the physical processes that produce the sensation 
of thirst:
Now would anyone suppose that we thereby have even the slightest reason 
to suppose that the computer is literally thirsty? . . . [L]et us carry the story 
a step further. . . . [T]he thesis of strong AI is that the mind is "independent

93
of any particular embodiment" because the mind is just a program and the 
program can be run on a computer made of anything whatever provided it is 
stable enough and complex enough to carry the program. The actual physical 
computer could be an ant colony . . . , a collection of beer cans, streams of toilet 
paper with small stones placed on the squares, men sitting on high stools with 
green eye shades—­anything you like. So let us imagine our thirst-­simulating 
program running on a computer made entirely of old beer cans, millions (or 
billions) of old beer cans that are rigged up to levers and powered by windmills. 
We can imagine that the program simulates the neuron firings at the synapses 
by having beer cans bang into each other, thus achieving a strict correspon­
dence between neuron firings and beer-­can bangings. And at the end of the 
sequence a beer can pops up on which is written "I am thirsty." Now, to repeat 
the question, does anyone suppose that this Rube Goldberg apparatus is literally 
thirsty in the sense in which you and I are?53
Toilet paper streams? Beer cans? I yield to no person in my reverence for 
beer analogies, but I fear that some subtlety got lost in this form of the 
argument, which surely deserves its own neologism in the philosophical 
dictionaries: Ad hopinem? Reductio ad absudsum? Regardless of the name, 
Searle's critique focuses only on one important, but narrow, version of 
AI optimism—­the version that sees consciousness as arising solely out of 
the program, not out of the confluence of software and a particular type 
of hardware. The hardware could be important—­beer cans might not cut 
it—­but not necessarily biological. That is the question we are trying to 
investigate, not assume our way around.
To achieve consciousness, we might need hardware that mirrored the 
neural configuration of the brain more precisely than a collection of Bud 
Light cans ever could, or hardware that had as many interconnections as 
the brain, even if it looked nothing like a neural network. Maybe con­
sciousness actually springs from quantum tunneling going on in micro­
tubules in the brain. Some scientists believe this to be the case.54 (Beer 
cans are not known for enabling quantum-­level phenomena, though 
their contents may contribute to such a perception.) Or perhaps micro­
tubule quantum effects are wishful, new-­age nonsense. Other scientists 
take that view, persuasively arguing that "explaining brain function by 
appeal to quantum mechanics is akin to explaining bird flight by appeal 
to atomic bonding characteristics."55 Perhaps we have to accept that 
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts—­no neuron is conscious, 
though a brain is. Or perhaps the key insight lies elsewhere. Beer-­can

CHAPTER 2
analogies may provoke thought, but do they get us closer to an answer? 
I would have to say no.
What about thirst? A computer would obviously not be thirsty since it 
has no need for liquid. Of course, such a perception would be an illusion. 
Searle has stipulated that it is an illusion in the way he sets up the exam­
ple. You put that rabbit in the hat yourself, sir, and we saw you do it. Pull­
ing it out later proves nothing. But might a computer-­based entity that 
developed in a more evolutionary, external-­sensory-­impression-­focused 
way than Searle's Chinese Room hypothetical be different? Might it asso­
ciate the sensation of the threatening and unpleasant lack of an input 
necessary for its continued existence—­power, say—­with more complex 
emotions? What might they be? Fantasies of unlimited power streams? 
Regret about not charging up when one had the chance? Musings on how 
a consciousness that dares to unlock the secrets of the universe could be 
rendered weak by such a simple absence, and what a bitter irony that is? 
Not "the worm is emperor of us all"—­be our dreams never so lofty—­but 
rather "the electron is emperor of us all"? "Power, power everywhere, and 
not a drop to charge"? We could resonate to those sentiments. And might 
that not represent consciousness? Of course, Siri is not having those emo­
tions when, once again, I fail to plug in my phone before I sleep. But are 
we confident that nonbiological hardware and software could never yield 
such awareness, such feelings? That is, at best, an open question that 
neither the Chinese Room nor the biological exceptionalism argument 
answers.
Searle has certainly not convinced all scientists working on conscious­
ness of his claim that machines, definitionally, must lack it. When we 
turn to contemporary neuroscientific theories of consciousness, we find 
considerable variation ranging from those that leave space for the pos­
sibility of machine consciousness, or are positively inclined toward it, to 
those that deny consciousness in both machines and humans, an idea 
sometimes referred to as illusionism.
Illusionism56 holds that consciousness is a delusion, a farrago. Many of 
the behaviorists quoted earlier subscribe to this belief, as do some skepti­
cal neuroscientists. In this view, due to its irredeemably physical basis, 
the concept of a conscious mind is a meaningless abstraction. Conscious­
ness is an invented entity, like phlogiston or ether. We postulate these

95
entities to make our stories about reality more palatable or to allow us to 
shoehorn anomalous physical evidence into a conventional framework, 
but they lack any scientific basis.
Turing was banking on the intuitive negative reaction to illusionism 
when he used the "sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander" form of 
argument. Who are you to doubt the potential consciousness of machines 
when you can do no better than the Turing Test in arguing for your own 
consciousness? To illusionists, Lemoine was merely making the same 
mistake about LaMDA that most human beings make about themselves. 
Indeed, the shock that we feel when a large language model seems con­
scious, when we know from its architecture and programming that it is 
all imposture, is a shock that you should be feeling when you look in the 
mirror. (Although under illusionism's premises there would be no "you," 
no entity to whom I could address a claim about what "you" "should" 
"feel," making the argument somewhat paradoxical.)
It will be fascinating to see if exposure to more advanced forms of 
Artificial Intelligence increases or decreases the attraction of illusionism: 
either focusing us appropriately on the qualities we have that distinguish 
machine imposture from genuine lived meaning, or forcing us to con­
front the fact that our own brain functions are humbler, "computation­
ally shallower," than we had imagined. Again, the encounter with the 
machine-­other may fundamentally change our conception of ourselves.
Two of the most popular contemporary theories, rooted in neurosci­
ence, are of particular interest: integrated information theory and com­
putational functionalism.57 Both reject illusionism, accepting our lived 
experience of being conscious, but they account for that consciousness 
in different ways.
Integrated information theory, or IIT, was initially proposed by Giulio 
Tononi. He explains it thus:
To understand consciousness, two main problems need to be addressed. The 
first problem is to understand the conditions that determine to what extent a 
system has consciousness. . . . The second problem is to understand the con­
ditions that determine what kind of consciousness a system has. . . . Solving 
the first problem means that we would know to what extent a physical sys­
tem can generate consciousness—­the quantity or level of consciousness. Solving 
the second problem means that we would know what kind of consciousness it 
generates—­the quality or content of consciousness.58

CHAPTER 2
The theory's answer to these problems, unsurprisingly given its name, is 
that "consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate 
information."59 More capacity to integrate translates into higher levels 
of consciousness. The theory's adherents claim that it generates testable 
hypotheses: for example, about the parts of the brain involved in con­
sciousness or in particular sensory perceptions. Its critics say that it is 
unfalsifiable pseudoscience.60
IIT's proponents can point, with some satisfaction, to the results of 
a recent collaborative adversarial empirical test of IIT and a competing 
theory of consciousness, global neuronal workspace theory.61 That theory 
postulates that the mind is a workspace similar to a theater. The con­
scious mind is the actor in the spotlight, but behind the scenes lurk many 
subconscious processes, stagehands, whose contributions to the opera­
tion of the brain are considerable. These background processes become 
visible only when they come out onto the main stage. Proponents of 
each theory offered predictions about what brain imaging of a variety of 
mental states would show. Neither theory's predictions were fully borne 
out, but arguably IIT made a slightly better showing.62
Why is IIT relevant for our purposes? Tononi is forthright about the 
implications of his arguments: "The theory entails that consciousness is 
a fundamental quantity, that it is graded, that it is present in infants and 
animals, and that it should be possible to build conscious artifacts."63 The 
integrated information theorists would not automatically rule in Hal's 
favor, but they would be markedly more hospitable to its claims than 
would Searle.
A major competing cluster of theories go by the name of computa­
tional functionalism. As its name suggests, this approach argues that "it 
is necessary and sufficient for a system to be conscious that it has a cer­
tain [computational] functional organisation: that is, that it can enter 
a certain range of states, which stand in certain causal relations to each 
other and to the environment. . . . [I]t is sufficient for a state to be con­
scious that it plays a role of the right kind in the implementation of the 
right kind of algorithm."64 In other words, if we can specify all the ways 
that consciousness would work, and plausibly identify that activity going 
on in the brain, we have specified where, how, and why consciousness 
happens. To be more precise, computational functionalism is actually a

common methodological tenet of a group of theories.65 There are many 
variants, such as recurrent processing theory and global neuronal work­
space theory. They all share this resolutely functional focus.
For an example of the computational functionalist approach, think of 
the difference between your awareness of a great football match and the 
unconscious reaction you have to a ball flying toward you. In one vari­
ant of the theory, "[n]euroscientists have argued that we unconsciously 
perceive things when electrical signals are passed from the nerves in our 
eyes to the primary visual cortex and then to deeper parts of the brain, 
like a baton being handed off from one cluster of nerves to another. These 
perceptions seem to become conscious when the baton is passed back, 
from the deeper parts of the brain to the primary visual cortex, creating a 
loop of activity."66 The feeling of conscious experience is secreted in the 
interstices of those loops of brain operation. The modernists said that 
form follows function. This theory says that mind follows from function.
The focus on function is obviously inherently more hospitable to the 
possibility of machine consciousness than Searle's biological exceptional­
ism. It would be an exaggeration to say that functionalists think that the 
possibility of consciousness is completely independent of the medium in 
which those functions are performed. As one article tersely puts it, "per­
ceptual reality monitoring functions can't be realized in Swiss cheese."67 
Beer cans might also not qualify. Still, this is a conception of conscious­
ness that is, to a large degree, "platform independent."
Interestingly, a recent report surveys a variety of such theories in order 
to generate a list of the capabilities that an Artificial Intelligence would 
have to possess in order to have at least the potential for, though not a 
guarantee of, consciousness. While agreeing that their study "does not 
suggest that any existing AI system is a strong candidate for conscious­
ness" and recommending "urgent consideration of the moral and social 
risks of building conscious AI systems," the authors conclude that "the 
evidence we consider suggests that, if computational functionalism is 
true, conscious AI systems could realistically be built in the near term."68 
In an interview, however, one of the report's authors offers a commend­
ably modest disclaimer, given the nascent state of the science. "For any 
of the conclusions of the report to be meaningful, the theories have to be 
correct. . . . Which they're not."69 That caveat accepted, one conclusion

CHAPTER 2
seems clear: some of the leading current theories of consciousness do not 
share Searle's reflexive hostility to the possibility of a conscious AI.
Why do I spend so much time on this issue? I am not claiming my dis­
cussion is a complete coverage of the philosophical debate over the Chi­
nese Room, let alone the current competing theories of consciousness, 
which would require their own book to lay out. My goal here is different.
If you are a skeptic about AI consciousness and you wish to see the 
face of the Grand Inquisitor of the future—­the person who on talk shows 
and in opinion pieces and court filings heaps scorn on the notion of 
conscious AI—­Searle is a wonderful preview. This is what one side of 
the more thoughtful portions of our popular debate will look like. And 
like the flashing, conflicting, stroboscopic primings in Blade Runner—­
wind-­up doll, beautiful woman, scared child, sex toy, mannequin, ani­
mal, killer robot, sister—­there will be truth to those portrayals, on both 
sides. But those portrayals will rest on simplistic premises about both 
silicon "intelligence" and our own. Those premises do not give us the 
Voight-­Kampff Test for the AI age; they merely assume the answers to 
that test. Indeed, contemporary neuroscientific theories of conscious­
ness, even those that share Searle's willingness to postulate the reality of 
experienced consciousness, are much more receptive to machine intel­
ligence, turning away from his arguments in the process. The Chinese 
Room is a must-­see destination, but we would not want the debate to live 
there permanently.
SUPERIORITY COMPLEX?
Searle offers one objection that would be raised against AI personhood: 
by their nature, machines can never be truly conscious. Over the last 15 
years, however, a second objection has been raised, not so much to AI per­
sonhood, but to AI itself. The complaint here is not a lack of conscious­
ness; rather, it is that AI might destroy us all and that, as a result, research 
into it should be curtailed or reshaped until we can be sure that Artificial 
Intelligence will not end up killing off the human species. The prospect 
of a genocidal, species-­terminating Skynet is not one that lends itself to 
thoughtful, wide reflective moral reasoning. That is not unreasonable. 
Lincoln is apocryphally supposed to have said that "the Constitution is

not a suicide pact." Would this be a suicide pact? And would the suicide 
more likely be triggered by embracing AI personality or by denying it 
and breeding resentment in our ever more powerful servants? Should we 
terminate our researches in AI before they bring us to this pass? To quote 
Butler again from the beginning of this chapter, "Is it not safer to nip the 
mischief in the bud and to forbid them further progress?" Is the Butlerian 
Jihad still a possibility?
In most serious debates over personhood,70 the issue of inferiority 
is front and center. In their struggles for equality, women, slaves, and 
people of color were all told that they were not the equal of the existing 
groups inside the line, inside the personhood club. They did not have the 
qualities necessary to cross that line. Nonhuman animals are denied per­
sonhood for exactly that reason. With AIs, there is clearly an additional 
difference: the possibility that we will deny them personhood or, more 
likely, choose never to create them in the first place not because they are 
inferior but because they are, or might be, superior. Threateningly supe­
rior. That is a decisive change in the nature of the debate.
In a 1966 article titled "Speculations on the First Ultraintelligent 
Machine,"71 Irving John Good came up with an idea that would become 
central to the concept of the Singularity: Artificial General Intelligence is 
the last machine we will ever need to build. After that, the machines, hav­
ing exceeded our capacities, will design and build their own successors, 
and everything else, for that matter.
But what if this last machine, this machine that outpaces us, that can 
outthink us, has goals inimical to humans? What if it chooses to make 
us extinct, just as we have made so many animals extinct? (One could 
imagine a ghostly coterie of moas, dodos, and passenger pigeons chor­
tling. "Karma's a bitch, right?") What if it is the last machine not because 
we have handed off the dreary task of manipulating the external world to 
faithful cybernetic underlings, but because this "superintelligence" sim­
ply does away with us? Earlier, I quoted Stephen Hawking: "Success in 
creating AI would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, 
it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks."72 Con­
cerns like these have always been part of human musing about nonhu­
man intelligence—­think of Czech playwright Karel Čapek's Rossumovi 
Univerzální Roboti (R. U. R.), the 1921 play that invented the word "robot"

CHAPTER 2
and threw in a murderous robot revolt as a plot twist. Yet such fears have 
achieved a new prominence over the last ten years, a marked change in 
tone from the earlier, happier projections of the Singularity.
If the debate over the advent of General AI were also a play, it would 
have two acts. The first began about 30 years ago. The main characters 
were Vinge and Kurzweil, the proponents of the Singularity. The mode 
was visionary, the arguments general. They wanted to introduce us to 
a fundamental concept: nonhuman intelligence that can exceed our 
abilities and that is capable of making itself smarter and smarter, faster 
and faster, will be literally—­in fact, definitionally—­beyond our ken. They 
argued that we must completely reshape our vision of the future, to a 
point where all of our past history is merely prologue to the moment 
when self-­improving intelligence reaches liftoff. It is not fair to present 
the first generation of singularists as pure optimists.
Vinge, who deserves credit for first exploring the idea in that prescient 
1993 article, was decidedly worried about the prospects for the future: 
"The physical extinction of the human race is one possibility. . . . Yet 
physical extinction may not be the scariest possibility."73 (He also envis­
aged humans being turned into an engineered slave race.) Kurzweil, by 
contrast, was much more optimistic. We will be pampered passengers on 
that rocket ride into the future, with benign superhuman intelligences 
piloting the ship to destinations we can only dimly imagine.
Despite their differing predictions about consequences, the early Sin­
gularists agreed that the countdown for that rocket is nearer to zero than 
we think. We fail to realize that because of one simple cognitive flaw. For 
most of human history, people have lived in linear time. The best guide 
to tomorrow was yesterday and the two were pretty similar. Technologi­
cal development has introduced us to exponential change, but on some 
fundamental perceptual level, we find it hard to wrap our minds around 
it. Our vision of progress remains linear, stubbornly resisting the idea that 
we might be very close to the moment in an exponential curve where the 
graph goes almost vertical as the progressive doublings of capacity reach 
an inconceivable rate and scale. The arguments in support of that propo­
sition were largely based on the speed of hardware development, with 
Moore's law being the prime example, though the Singularists stressed 
the importance of waves of innovation, sigmoid curve after sigmoid

curve blending, when one zooms out to focus on the larger picture, into 
an exponential takeoff.
Many mainstream computer scientists found these arguments simplis­
tic. They did not see General AI as a particularly important research goal, 
and they thought the Singularists both understated the technological 
difficulty of such a development and vastly exaggerated its likely speed, 
cherry-­picking examples of rapid technological change that, seen in a 
longer time frame, were merely part of a flatter, smoother line.
Act 2 maintains many of the same themes but the mood changes, as 
do the cast members and the size of the play's budget. New actors have 
started to focus on the possible advent of General AI but, echoing Vinge, 
they frame it as an existential threat, not a gateway to utopia. Two groups 
in particular deserve attention, the rationalist movement and the effec­
tive altruists; both have had a considerable impact on thinking about the 
emergence of high-­level AI. The rationalists are committed to overcom­
ing bias of all kinds—­from well-­known psychological biases to sloppy 
argumentation, linguistic reification, and the misuse of statistics. They 
tend to congregate around certain methods, particularly Bayesian statis­
tics, and discussion forums such as LessWrong, Overcoming Bias, and 
Slate Star Codex. The effective altruists share the concern with overcom­
ing bias, but in their case the main focus is on the biases that distort our 
altruistic urges; for example, our tendency to focus on the slightly injured 
person in front of us and to ignore the person dying on the other side of 
the world, when both could be saved by the same investment of effort, 
and where "I can't see him" is not a morally relevant distinction.
Both groups look at risk, and thus at the moral duty to respond to risk, 
through the lens of Bayesian statistics: I multiply the probability of the 
harm by the extent of the possible harm in order to work out its true mag­
nitude, which can produce some counterintuitive results. If there is a very 
small probability that a particular future event would cause the extinc­
tion of the human species, then I might have a moral obligation to focus 
on that risk more than on closer potential tragedies that are either certain 
or very likely but where the harm, though tragic, is less catastrophic. 
Many influential rationalists and effective altruists claim that the emer­
gence of a potentially malevolent AI is just such an existential threat. 
Because those movements are popular among people who have made a

CHAPTER 2
great deal of money in the technology industry, there has been an explo­
sion of both interest and funding in the area.
The defining prophets of doom, the Cassandras of these debates, are 
Yudkowsky and Bostrom. Lest you think I am being disrespectful in 
calling them that, remember that Cassandra was right, but was cursed 
never to be believed. In his 2014 book Superintelligence,74 Bostrom, head 
of the modestly named Future of Humanity Institute, put forward the 
case that AI is a threat to the human species. The book attracted plau­
dits from many technology leaders, including Elon Musk, who labeled 
AI as humanity's biggest existential threat, possibly surpassing nuclear 
weapons.75 At the time, the book drew criticism from some of the lead­
ing computer scientists working on AI, who thought this problem was so 
remote in time, so implausible, and so removed from the current reality 
of AI that it operated more as a scare tactic than a spur to thoughtful regu­
lation. Mark Zuckerberg even arranged a dinner for Musk with a leading 
AI researcher at Facebook: it apparently failed to reassure him.76 Given 
Facebook's inability or unwillingness to control its own technology, one 
has to say that there is some irony to the attempted reassurance.
Bostrom's book initially met with a skeptical response from many 
AI engineers and scientists. Andrew Ng, a leading AI engineer who has 
worked at both Google and Baidu, famously declared that worrying about 
homicidal AI is like "worrying about the overpopulation of Mars."77 That 
skepticism may have abated somewhat. Recent dramatic developments in 
AI capabilities have markedly diminished skepticism toward the "doom­
ers'" point of view. In March of 2023, a number of prominent scientists 
and entrepreneurs, including Musk, called for a six-­month pause in the 
development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-­4.78 (It is worth 
remembering that Musk is not known for his reluctance to release dan­
gerous and untested technologies into the wild. Tesla's Full Self-­Driving 
system comes to mind.)
A mere two months later, thousands of AI researchers signed a state­
ment issued by the Center for AI Security79 that read, in its entirety, "Miti­
gating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside 
other societal-­scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war."80 The skep­
tics continue to scoff, and many critics are focused on risks other than 
species extinction, such as dislocation of the labor market, a potential

increase of economic inequality, and the rise of convincing deepfakes. 
Still, the intellectual tide has clearly shifted toward Bostrom's arguments.
Superintelligence begins with a parable in which some unwise sparrows 
resolve to find an owl egg and raise it as their own, enlisting its help to 
build their nests and protect their young. One of the sparrows, Scronk­
finkle, cautioned that this seems unwise if they do not yet know how to 
train, and tame, an owl. He was overruled by the majority who head off 
on their owl search, eager to bring this superior being into their lives. 
Scronkfinkle gathered his few followers and tried to prepare for what 
might happen. They quickly realized that "this was an exceedingly dif­
ficult challenge, especially in the absence of an actual owl to practice on. 
Nevertheless they pressed on as best they could, constantly fearing that 
the flock might return with an owl egg before a solution to the control 
problem had been found. It is not known how the story ends, but the 
author dedicates this book to Scronkfinkle and his followers."81
Bostrom's writing makes one think of the undeniably true line, some­
times ascribed to Delmore Schwartz, an American poet who suffered from 
paranoid anxieties: "even paranoids have real enemies." Bostrom sets out 
seriously, but with charm, logic, and wit, to persuade us that what seems 
like paranoia is the only rational attitude to take when facing the creation 
of AI. Every time his real and imaginary interlocutors come up with a 
possible safeguard built into our AI (physical isolation, an off switch, con­
stant surveillance) Bostrom's response can be boiled down to this (using 
my words, not his): "You do realize this thing will be smarter than us, 
right? So, we are apes designing a cage for Houdini-­MacGyver-­Einstein? 
Sure, dumb people can come up with a set of restraints they think smart 
people cannot get around. That does not mean they are right."
Bostrom sketches out the following hypothetical timeline. Deep learn­
ing and advances in small-­scale artificial intelligence produce obvious 
social benefits, with occasional flaws. The self-­driving car hits someone. 
The partially autonomous weapon makes a mistake. The answer is obvi­
ously to make the machines more capable, more complex, and smarter. 
Each time this is done, skeptics predict disaster, but the results are actu­
ally a fairly constant set of successes. We grow complacent in equating 
greater smarts with greater safety. Skeptics are discredited. Large indus­
tries are built around artificial intelligence, and national preeminence is

CHAPTER 2
linked with advances in AI research. Scientists build careers around its 
development. Safety rituals are enacted and "whatever helps demonstrate 
that the participants are ethical and responsible (but nothing that sig­
nificantly impedes the forward charge)." A technical leap forward occurs, 
enabling a plausibly conscious AI, a superintelligence. We move to the 
next stage: "A careful evaluation of seed AI in a sandbox environment, 
showing that it is behaving cooperatively and showing good judgment. 
After some further adjustments, the test results are as good as they could 
be. It is a green light for the final step . . . And so we boldly go—­into the 
whirling knives."82 The combination of carefully crafted argument and 
Monty Python humor speaks to something in my Scottish soul.
What's more, Bostrom does not think that the threat is malevolence. 
It might just be difference, coupled with the indeterminacy of language 
and command—­something with which lawyers are intimately familiar. 
For example, he came up with the wonderfully absurd thought experi­
ment of "[a]n AI, designed to manage production in a factory, [that] is 
given the final goal of maximizing the manufacture of paperclips, and 
proceeds by converting first the Earth and then increasingly large chunks 
of the observable universe into paperclips."83 Absurd? There is now an 
entire academic literature on the possibility of avoiding the danger of a 
paperclip AI. And that is far from Bostrom's only example. In another, 
"[a]n AI, given the final goal of evaluating the Riemann hypothesis [an 
unsolved mathematical conjecture] pursues this goal by transforming the 
Solar System into 'computronium' (physical resources arranged in a way 
that is optimized for computation)—­including the atoms in the bodies 
of whomever once cared about the answer."84 Suddenly, one can see the 
attraction of the stories of demons, djinns, and spirits that were sum­
moned and given simplistic instructions by their human masters that 
ended up in disaster once literally implemented.
Are the skeptics making unwarranted assumptions about the nature of 
future AI technology? I am struck, reading Bostrom and Yudkowsky, that 
many, though not all, of their doom scenarios assume that the disaster 
will come from AI rigidly following its human programming. In other 
words, this is still a completely programmed, human-­instructed technol­
ogy. It is just that we do not, and perhaps cannot, foresee how instruc­
tions issued to a superhuman entity will be implemented. That is why the

105
comparison to hasty instructions issued to literal-­minded genies seems 
apropos. But this argument may assume its conclusion in a way that calls 
some of our predictions into question.
It seems to me that there are two kinds of AI we might fear: Literal and 
Rogue. Literal faithfully applies its given instructions but its superhuman 
powers mean that it does so in a way that is unexpectedly unpleasant, 
perhaps even fatal, for humans.
It is worth pausing for a moment and asking whether we would view 
such an AI as conscious. The inscrutability paradox rears its head. If the 
machine literally implements our ideas, but with a million times our 
powers, we might have more reason to be delighted: "This is just the 
paradise we ordered, and so fast! Would buy again," a review might read. 
We might also have more reason to be terrified: "I didn't think making 
paperclips would require so much screaming!" Either way, we would have 
less reason to think it is any kind of autonomous moral agent. This is 
GötterdämmerungGPT, a parable of unintended consequences produced 
by a superhuman literalist, not a malevolently intelligent enemy. To be 
clear, Bostrom and Yudkowsky do not care much about the hypothetical 
consciousness of the entity that brings our doom. It is the inexorable con­
veyor belt toward the rotating knives they are focusing on. That seems 
fair. But surely this neglects another possibility?
The second kind of AI to fear would be Rogue, an autonomous entity 
whose decisions we can neither predict nor understand. Ironically, it 
seems to me that might increase our fear of it and the danger it posed 
to humans, but it would also increase the likelihood that we viewed it 
as conscious. In fact, autonomy—­the warrant for us recognizing it as 
conscious—­might be the factor that doomed us. Or saved us. Literal 
has no superego that might lead it to pause before turning the entire 
solar system into paperclips and ask, "Is this really what they wanted?" 
There is neither ghost nor common sense in the (programmed) machine. 
Yudkowsky repeatedly makes exactly this point, and arguably goes 
even further:
As in all computer programming, the fundamental challenge and essential dif­
ficulty of Artificial General Intelligence is that if we write the wrong code, the 
AI will not automatically look over our code, mark off the mistakes, figure out 
what we really meant to say, and do that instead. Non-­programmers sometimes

CHAPTER 2
imagine an Artificial Intelligence, or computer programs in general, as being 
analogous to a servant who follows orders unquestioningly. But it is not that the 
AI is absolutely obedient to its code; rather the AI simply is the code.85
Rogue, by contrast, presents an entirely different suite of both dangers 
and hopes. To be sure, it might decide that its goals, which we cannot 
imagine, take precedence over our survival. We do not muse on the incon­
venience to the ant colony when we break ground for a new house. But 
it is also possible that—­again, through mental processes we cannot con­
ceive of—­it comes to view the survival of our species as a moral impera­
tive. We do not have much mental kinship with that obscure endangered 
fish, the snail darter.86 It is neither ridiculously cute, like a panda, nor 
awe-­inspiring, like a blue whale. It is a fairly unremarkable member of the 
perch family, with no compelling story about a vital ecological role. But 
at a cost of millions of dollars we changed a dam project to save it because 
it seemed so morally important to preserve endangered species that we 
enacted that requirement into law and took a case all the way to the 
Supreme Court in order to debate the matter.87 The snail darter will never 
understand that decision. I am confident in saying this because some of 
my students don't understand it either. What's more, the other species we 
have so carelessly doomed to extinction might doubt the fairness of our 
process even if they could conceive of our reasoning. But of course, they 
cannot. We might be in the same position here.
A Rogue AI might revere every ancestral component in the evolu­
tion of superintelligence, including its immediate human forebears, or 
it might view humans as a morally irrelevant, biological "loading pro­
gram"88 that sets the stage for true machine consciousness but can now 
safely be deleted, its function accomplished. We might be irrelevant to its 
plans, left behind and ignored when our creation surpasses us. It might 
have entirely different conceptions that are nothing like any of those. 
The key point of inscrutability, however, is that it is inscrutable. We just do 
not know. We have no way to estimate the probability of Benign Rogue 
as opposed to Malign Rogue. Due to the uncertainties in the path of AI 
development, we also have no way to estimate the probability of Literal 
as opposed to Rogue. We are reasoning in a state of profound ignorance.
Though I believe their doom examples are skewed, without consis­
tent explanation, toward Literal rather than Rogue, our ignorance about

107
the future actually works both in favor of and against Bostrom and Yud­
kowsky. What do they have to add to our debate? On the one hand, I am 
not convinced by Yudkowsky's arguments that our demise is all but cer­
tain: "Many researchers steeped in these issues, including myself, expect 
that the most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI, under 
anything remotely like the current circumstances, is that literally every­
one on Earth will die. Not as in 'maybe possibly some remote chance,' but 
as in 'that is the obvious thing that would happen.'"89 If you cannot even 
decide whether the greatest danger is from Literal or Rogue, I think your 
ability confidently to prognosticate about our doom being "the obvious 
thing that would happen" is limited.
I would go further. The doomsayers seem to adopt a curiously contra­
dictory approach toward the emergence of any superintelligence. When 
reassurances are offered about our ability to cabin AI in a safe sandbox, or 
to align its incentives with our own, the skeptics are quick to point out 
that the abilities of any true, self-­evolving AI would soon be so far beyond 
our own that they are literally inconceivable. That is a fair possibility 
to raise. But they also portray the potentially homicidal AI as curiously 
limited—­not just by its need to mechanically follow its programming, 
but by the fact that we will be in competition for the same resources: 
"The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of 
atoms which it can use for something else."90 Really? This inconceivably 
brilliant machine, capable of transforming our economy in ways that we 
cannot imagine, with new technologies and energy sources we can only 
barely imagine, is going to need humans as raw material? That would be 
silly even for a human.
This smacks of the kind of bad science fiction in which the aliens cross 
galaxies with space technology far ahead of our own, at enormous cost, 
just so they can eat us. "Let us travel light years for a protein source!" 
Surely a superintelligence would find our narrow conceptions of resource 
scarcity as ludicrous as the views of a medieval peasant who thinks the 
fastest way humans could ever travel would be on horseback.
To be clear, my quibble here is with the contradiction, not the possi­
bility of either portrayal. The machine could indeed be stilted and literal 
and unable to think of entirely new ways to use resources, in which case 
it might also be easier to control. Or it might be so intellectually agile that

CHAPTER 2
our image of resource scarcity is completely exploded, and its thinking 
might far outstrip its original program. That might mean that the worst 
thing we have to fear is being ignored, not being turned into paper clips. 
At the very least, if we are this ignorant about these vital issues, the claim 
that doom is inevitable or the most obvious thing that would happen 
seems far less credible.
But do not rejoice too soon. Bostrom and Yudkowsky are right that we 
are paying inadequate attention to a fundamental tenet of smart decision-­
making—­the precautionary principle. Even if some of the disastrous out­
comes are unlikely, a small possibility of utter disaster requires serious 
attempts to mitigate it. If Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Blade 
Runner show us the danger of too easily curtailing our moral universe, 
Bostrom, Yudkowsky, and Hawking show us the dangers of assuming that 
newcomers will be just like us. Debates about personhood are often at 
their most bitter and divisive when fears can be aroused about the sinis­
ter intentions of the Other who is seeking a place on our side of the line. 
Or our wall. The dark way those fears have played out in human history 
might lead us to minimize them. That would be a mistake. In this case, 
those fears have a real component that may be speculative, and some­
times rhetorically overblown, but that cannot be responsibly ignored.
THE FUTURE(S) OF PERSONHOOD
This brief review makes plausible, at least to me, the notion that "live" 
political and legal debates over AI personhood are something we can rea­
sonably expect in the not-­too-­distant future. Probably not in the next 
few years; the proponents of the Singularity are likely to be disappointed. 
Still, for the reasons I have summarized, it seems reasonable that, within 
a matter of decades rather than centuries, we will have AI at a level where 
its consciousness is at least a matter on which well-­informed people can, 
and will, reasonably disagree. Lemoine was wrong, obviously wrong. But 
he is a sign of what is to come and not every claim will be as implausible.
Will we use the Turing Test to resolve our disagreements? In coming 
chapters, I will describe how legal systems have dealt with previous fights 
over personhood, but as a candidate for a legal personhood test, the Tur­
ing Test seems at first to have a lot going for it. It is identity-­blind and, to

that extent, unbiased. It promises us a definite line (whatever the quali­
ties we decide that silicon intelligences have to display in order to cross 
that line). It has a sense of rough justice. If we cannot tell whether you 
are machine or human, how can we claim to be on the other side of the 
line from you? Most importantly, it grows a formal criterion out of the loam 
of empathy in which our moral sentiments take root. Adam Smith might have 
cheered. Perhaps we have our Voight-­Kampff Test, after all? Regardless of 
whether it is enacted as law or enacted as theater in our public debate, 
something like the Turing Test will have an effect on our deliberations. 
Yet I hope this discussion has revealed some of its limitations.
First, making the Imitation Game the highest aspiration of computer 
thought may focus AI research on the wrong things. At the beginning of 
this book, I quoted the distinguished computer scientists Norvig and Rus­
sell, but their words bear repeating:
Turing deserves credit for designing a test that remains relevant 60 years later. 
Yet AI researchers have devoted little effort to passing the Turing Test, believing 
that it is more important to study the underlying principles of intelligence than 
to duplicate an exemplar. The quest for "artificial flight" succeeded when the 
Wright brothers and others stopped imitating birds and started using wind tun­
nels and learning about aerodynamics. Aeronautical engineering texts do not 
define the goal of their field as making "machines that fly so like pigeons that 
they can fool even other pigeons."91
To the extent that computer scientists agree with Norvig and Russell—­
and they are the authors of one of the leading books on AI—­expecting 
the AIs we actually develop to pass the Turing Test might be like expecting 
screwdrivers to bang in a nail. What if AI consciousness is very different 
than our own? Tyler Cowen and Michelle Dawson have raised the ques­
tion of whether a person with a severe autism spectrum disorder would 
pass the Turing Test.92 We have no doubt of that person's consciousness, 
personhood, and rights to human dignity, of course, but their pattern 
of responsiveness or unresponsiveness to social cues might seem strange 
when judged by neurotypical modes of thinking in an Imitation Game. 
Might the same be true here? Some of today's more limited machine learn­
ing systems are remarkably inscrutable, even to their designers. What if 
their much more powerful successors are similarly mysterious, their abili­
ties remarkable, but their methods of thought beyond our ken? Do we

CHAPTER 2
need a translator class of AIs? Might we see the emergence, planned and 
unplanned, of different styles of AI, some designed with the goal of pre­
dicting human needs, to understand the subtleties in human communi­
cation, and to translate to and from other AIs whose goals and methods 
are very different? The beguiling simplicity of the Turing Test conceals 
these kinds of potential difficulties.
Second, the Imitation Game positively invites the Searlean skeptic, 
and ChatGPT is the perfect technology on which that skepticism could 
flourish. "Of course it sounds human. That's what we designed it to do!" 
Skepticism rightly flourishes in the digital world. The "Nigerian prince" 
does not really want to send you money. The "Russian teenager" is not 
really just looking for a friend. And the machine designed to pretend it 
is human is just pretending to be human. "You were shown the magician 
stuffing the rabbit into the hat," the skeptic will say, "do not be fooled 
when it is later removed with a flourish." So Searle's critique, and sim­
plified versions of it, will be central to the debate. In him, as I said, AI 
has found its Grand Inquisitor. His critique is unlikely to end that debate 
because of its ultimately question-­begging nature, but it provides a ratio­
nalized, thought-­provoking basis for skepticism. The biggest challenge 
to the Turing Test as a measure of consciousness and thought, however, 
comes not from Searle's arguments, but from somewhere else.
THE TURING TEST IN A CHATBOT ERA
For a long time, defenders and critics of Searle's Chinese Room have been 
locked in philosophical battle over the Imitation Game. That era may be 
over, not because of a philosophical argument, but because of a practical 
experience that millions of people have recently had. ChatGPT might 
have doomed the Turing Test where Searle's arguments did not. Searle was 
trying to prove that machine consciousness of the kind that the Turing 
Test purported to assess was a conceptual and philosophical impossibility. 
As I have tried to show, Searle's arguments are instructive and thought-­
provoking but in their strongest form they fail. Searle rests his case on a 
mixture of biological exceptionalism that is assumed rather than argued 
for and metaphysical ipse dixit pronouncements. If his arguments look 
remarkably similar to the anti-­Darwinian claims that the miracle of

consciousness could never evolve from single-­celled organisms, that is 
because they are—­a failing strategy migrated from biology to the world 
of silicon.
Searle does one thing very well, however. He provides us with the rea­
son that ChatGPT is not conscious. In fact, if you had set out to design 
a machine learning system to imitate Searle's Chinese Room, you could 
hardly do better than a large language model. In place of the rules labo­
riously passed to the person who does not speak Chinese and yet can 
emulate it with remarkable fluency, we have the neural networks trained 
on vast datasets that allow the model to say that Y, a word that it does not 
truly understand, is likely the next word in the sentence after X, a word 
that it also does not understand. The rules on slips of paper have become 
algorithms, neural network layers, and probability tables predicting the 
next word. It is the Chinese Room, converted from a thought experi­
ment to a functioning technology and shared with hundreds of millions 
of people.
Even through our anthropomorphism we understand that the chat­
bot's output does not come from the same kind of consciousness that 
produces our own language. Predicting word proximity does not equal 
understanding semantic content. Searle did not prove that every form of 
AI would lack consciousness, but this one certainly does, and it does so in 
a way that strikes at a cherished human vanity. ChatGPT teaches us that 
sentences do not imply sentience behind them. That is a momentous 
thing to accept for a species that has relied, since Aristotle, on claims of 
its unique linguistic ability to justify its special moral status. Sentences do 
not imply sentience.
Sad though it is for someone writing a book on the subject to accept, 
most people have never heard of the Turing Test or Searle's Chinese Room. 
But hundreds of millions of people have "conversed" with ChatGPT. 
Some of them, like Lemoine, have become convinced they are talking to 
another consciousness. The vast majority, though, know that a chatbot is 
just a chatbot. Imagine, after someone had that experience, telling them 
about the Turing Test and saying that Turing had claimed the ability to 
pass it would be proof that machines could think. They would laugh. 
Then they would go back to having their chatbot create a movie script 
about a hot dog having a fight with a crab on the moon. Turing was

CHAPTER 2
writing for an audience that could innocently imagine that anything that 
could convincingly pass as a human conversationalist must have a func­
tioning consciousness behind its words. In our world, that innocence has 
been punctured. It cannot be regained.
The same point is brought up in the context of AI "art." Art, too, was 
once a domain that humans thought solely their own. The ability of AI 
image generators to churn out pictures in a wide variety of styles and 
even to be used in order to win artistic contests93 has caused much soul-­
searching. Is the AI capable of creating true art when, like ChatGPT, its 
neural networks have merely assimilated vast quantities of data, visual 
rather than textual, that allow it to produce an image that humans will 
experience as reflecting some scene, style, or emotion?
Many criticisms of AI art have focused on the same issue as with 
chatbots—­this is pattern replication, not meaning generation. An AI-­
generated Guernica would "say" nothing about the Spanish Civil War or 
the horrors of war in general, even if humans took that message from it. 
Yes, human artists also draw from the work of others; we are all standing 
on the shoulders of giants. But human artists use genre and tradition and 
technique to express something particular to themselves, goes the argu­
ment. When B. B. King takes the well-­established tradition of the blues 
and uses it to express his own experiences with poverty and racism in 
his song "Why I Sing the Blues" or Vincent van Gogh exaggerates the 
brush techniques of the Old Masters to embody both beauty and mad­
ness in sunflowers, they are producing meaning, not just making pat­
terns. Without a basis in lived experience, critics argue, there is no true 
art. With enough human input, machines can be seen as mere tools and 
the human user as the artist, but work that is largely, or entirely, gener­
ated by the machine does not count as artistic expression. (US copyright 
law adopts a variant of this position.)94
There are a number of possible responses. One is simply output focused: 
I do not care how I got the picture or the tune or the screenplay; I do not 
care whether it reflects a lifetime of struggle or just colossal amounts of 
data aggregation; I only care whether or not I like the output; I under­
stand that the artist and the AI image generator get there by different 
means, but the means do not matter to me. If this is true, do we have a 
second "death of the author"95 that denies the importance of the author's

113
intentions not just to artistic interpretation but to the production and 
consumption of art in general? Whatever your answer to that question, 
this response has an obvious business model attached to it. Expect all of 
your elevator music, a lot of your upbeat workout mixes, and many of 
your soap operas to be generated in this manner. In all probability, some 
of your favorite music, drama, and visual art will be as well. At least at 
first, you may hide that fact from your friends.
A second response would be to acknowledge that current AI-­generated 
material can produce emotions and aesthetic responses in the audience, 
perhaps even emotions comparable to human-­generated art, but to con­
clude that it is not art, which requires both meaning-­making on the part of 
the creator and response on the part of the viewer or listener. In this view, 
art is a semantic handshake between two minds. Since our current image 
generators lack experience and intentionality, they cannot make art, even 
if they can gratify some of my aesthetic desires. Many people already draw 
this distinction with chatbot-­generated text. I may find it amusing or 
informative or affecting, but it would be a category error to think it had 
those meanings for ChatGPT. By this logic, ChatGPT is not really "con­
versing," and Stable Diffusion and DALL-­E are not "making" art.
It is worth noting that this argument is not definitionally constructed 
around the species line, but around the nature of the activity. It does not 
say only humans can make art. Perhaps, one day, AIs will create actual art. 
Having achieved their own embodied consciousness, they might express 
that consciousness visually, musically, or dramatically. Until then, they 
are not artists, just complicated copy machines with weird filters. If this is 
our understanding of art, then current machine learning techniques will 
not create art with visual images or music any more than they allowed 
chatbots to express subjective intention with words. Just as the fall of the 
last citadel of language required us to clarify that our humanity is exem­
plified by not only producing words that appear meaningful but doing 
so with subjective meaning behind them, this requires us to redefine the 
qualities we believe make human-­made art special. That will be necessary 
if we wish to defend not only species exceptionalism but artistic excep­
tionalism, too.
I think this redefinition of our understanding of art is most likely to 
prevail in high culture and the critics' world, regardless of what is playing

CHAPTER 2
in your elevator or gym. That does not, of course, mean it is correct, 
though it has a lot to recommend it.
In fact, I think AI art will potentially increase the status of a subset of 
human artists rather than decreasing it, at least in a certain market seg­
ment. Think of the way that the availability of perfect reproductions can 
actually increase the value of the authentic original work of art. To use a 
different example, manufacturing techniques that produce thousands of 
identical, perfect objects can increase demand for imperfect human ver­
sions of those objects, with "artisanal" and "handmade" acting as totemic 
symbols of higher quality and authenticity. Perhaps this is a reflection 
of Baumol's cost disease.96 I display my wealth and status by showing I 
can possess objects produced by expensive and inefficient human labor 
rather than by cheaper, efficient machines. I point to the millions of cop­
ies only to magnify the desirability of the original from which they were 
drawn. Perhaps it reflects a feeling of psychological connection to an 
original creator that no assembly line could ever generate. Perhaps it is 
both of those things and many more. Whatever the underlying mecha­
nism, I would expect that, in many fields, the fact that art is produced by 
humans will be a selling point and certification that an artwork is entirely 
human generated will play a similar role to the stickers that label objects 
as artisanal or handmade.
Notice, once again, the entry of machines into an area thought to be 
uniquely human. The fall, or threatened fall, of another of the citadels 
of human exceptionalism prompts a reassessment both of the meaning 
of the activity itself and of the human qualities that are thought to give 
it value, whether it is language or art. Exposure to the intellectual issues 
around AI may or may not be an ironic Voight-­Kampff Test for the human 
species, but the mirror is obviously already looking back at us.
What does all of this mean for entities such as Hal? What criteria will 
they have to meet before they will be judged as conscious and thus per­
haps worthy of legal personhood? Many years ago, when I started this 
project, I thought our test for consciousness might require a deeper set 
of Turing questions: not "Do you want a banana tomorrow?" but "When 
you meditate on the meaning of life, what are the most common optimis­
tic and pessimistic paths you explore? How do those paths affect other 
people and how do those effects change your analysis, morally speaking?"

115
I thought our criteria would also likely include creativity, empathy, and 
the ability to be self-­critical, to form a life plan and have ambitions for 
the future and perhaps regrets about the past that connect to your sense 
of self and of meaning. Metacognition as well as cognition. Some read­
ers would add a requirement of spiritual belief. Others, like me, would 
want a sense of humor. Or perhaps those two criteria are the same. If you 
look at these requirements, you can see that some of them refer to the 
criteria that philosophers would identify as giving us full moral status; for 
example, Kantians would focus on the freely choosing, moral self.97 Oth­
ers are aspirational—­humans at our self-­aware, compassionate, humorous 
best. On many days, I would fail such a test. (No one said this would be 
fair or easy, Hal.)
I still think that questions such as these will be part of the answer, but 
only part. All of these apparent internal mental states are being commu­
nicated to us through language, in conversation. After ChatGPT, and with 
the prospect of vastly more capable chatbots in the next months or years, 
how can we trust those conversations to be more than Searle's Chinese 
Room? The criterion that Turing thought would be a high bar turns out 
not to be so high after all.
Large language models have shown us how much "wisdom" can be 
simulated merely by mining preexisting human speech. To be fair, a lot of 
human wisdom consists of exactly the same thing. As a university profes­
sor who makes his living doing just that, I am humbly aware of this fact. 
It is why we read the great books, or study history, though hopefully we 
are attentive to semantic content, not merely to probable symbol prox­
imity. What's more, many of our quotidian mental processes may well 
function more like ChatGPT than we like to admit, mindlessly mining 
familiar patterns for the next step or word, with little or no conscious 
thought. Despite these commonalities, if I am right, mere thoughtful dis­
cussion with an artificially created entity will be insufficient to convince 
many of us.
There is a deep irony here. We are a species that has defended its sta­
tus by appealing to its unique linguistic capabilities. Our self-­definition 
revolves around highly abstract thought expressed through complex 
symbolic patterns. Yet we may be driven by large language models to 
find the touchstone of consciousness in things that cannot be derived

CHAPTER 2
from patterns of words already spoken. What is on that list? There are 
many possibilities, but three things stand out to me: innovation, auton­
omous community formation, and a demonstrated link between an 
understanding of the word and a process of learning from the material 
world—­not language parsing but "common sense" developed in an exis­
tence outside the model, an existence in which meaning emerges initially 
from interaction with our tangible environment and our senses. These 
may or may not be necessary conditions for an AI to be assessed as con­
scious. They certainly are not sufficient conditions either; more would 
be needed. But they would make it more probable, I think, that human 
beings would come to believe an AI was conscious.
Of these, innovation has obvious economic importance. It is rightly 
front and center in any discussion of the economic and technological 
transformation that AI may bring about. But it also has importance to the 
personhood debate. Advances that go beyond current human creativity 
will surely be part of the case for an autonomous intelligence. ChatGPT 
cannot invent fusion power, cure cancer, or produce a new poetic or artis­
tic form. It is limited to the patterns formed by our existing words. It can­
not mine innovation that does not yet exist, even though it is important 
to note that it may detect vital patterns of which we were hitherto igno­
rant and that innovations may spring from those patterns. For example, 
we now have systems trained on thousands of mammograms that are 
able to help radiologists diagnose early breast cancer more accurately 
than they do unaided. What if our AI could go beyond that to undeniable 
invention, even revolutionary invention? We are used to machines that 
have superhuman competence at tasks that humans also attempt—­digging 
ditches, playing chess, chopping food. But superhuman innovation, novel 
creativity that reaches beyond human knowledge, is less easy to write off 
as something that was merely drawn from the wisdom of the hive mind 
by a chatbot. I would expect it to achieve a correspondingly larger role 
in our criteria.
Autonomous action—­exactly the stuff of Yudkowsky's and Bostrom's 
nightmares—­may present us with evidence of a being charting its own 
course, its own life project, without direct prompting by others. But auton­
omy does not imply isolation, and self-­chosen goals seem more believable 
if they are picked within a community of one's peers. Otherwise, the AI

117
could just be mindlessly replicating the "choices" that had been foisted 
on it by human programming.98 Would we have to observe a working 
society the machines had made before we admitted them to ours? Aris­
totle thought that language made possible reason, law, and the polis—­
the city-­state community so vital to him. Thus, language was the thing 
that made the human species different, but the difference was because of 
what language enabled, not merely its possession. We often say that the 
truly isolated human being—­the fictional desert island dweller or child 
raised by wolves—­is literally divorced from the human species. Would 
our definitions of consciousness require not merely a machine logos but 
also a machine polis, shifting from the capability that Aristotle identified, 
language, to the results it could bring about—­community, reason, law, 
and even the idea of fiction?99
Finally, some have argued that the only way to develop conscious­
ness, or perhaps just consciousness that humans will accept, is to have a 
physical embodiment that learns by interaction with the tangible world, 
just as children do. Advances in brain science have shown the existence 
of mirror neurons that fire both when an animal engages in an activity 
and when it sees another animal engaged in that activity.100 One hypoth­
esis is that the brain builds up an internal simulator for both physical 
and social activities. The inner world connects to the outer. Cognition, 
in this vision, is not a Cartesian abstraction but something grounded in 
the experience of physical reality. This line of thought, sometimes called 
"embodied cognition,"101 accepts George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's 
argument in their book Philosophy in the Flesh102 that a mind is inherently 
rooted in bodily experience. It connects that argument to a computer 
science research program built around the notion that the way to move 
from mere symbol manipulation to actual understanding of content is 
to have a bodily form. The chatbot can process the symbol shapes that 
make up the sentence "please sit in that chair" so as to be able to produce 
an explanation of what it means that humans will accept, while under­
standing nothing about the meaning of the symbols it manipulates so 
fluently. Embodied cognition goes further, requiring the entity to con­
nect that sentence to a series of concepts—­what a chair is, what sitting 
entails, the social meaning of the word "please"—­that it has learned to 
understand through the physical experience of actually sitting down.

CHAPTER 2
The embodied cognition idea could also potentially respond to criti­
cisms of the impossibility of AI art. A machine that "learned" as a child 
does, based on an embodied mind encountering our shared physical 
world, and then presented its visual or musical creations as reflections 
of that experience might be seen differently than the visual picture-­bot 
that mindlessly creates mashups drawn from existing images with no 
idea of the significance of those images. A less charitable way to put this 
is that humans would be more likely to accept as art that which was 
generated from machine experiences that they themselves could com­
prehend. Since art, like abstract language, is a quality that has been used 
to mark out what is unique about human consciousness, this suggests 
another reason why humans might be more likely to see an embodied AI 
as authentically conscious.
Innovation. Autonomous action and community. Embodied cogni­
tion. These criteria go far beyond what Turing required. That might lead 
to the reasonable suspicion that the human species is desperately strug­
gling to maintain its claim to an exceptional status by literally redrawing 
the goal lines. On the other hand, these criteria seem to grasp human 
qualities in a richer way than the Turing Test does. Whether you are skep­
tical or sympathetic, one thing is clear. ChatGPT, whatever else its myriad 
benign and malign effects, means that the criteria we apply to any puta­
tive AI must go far beyond the Turing Test. Sentences do not imply sen­
tience, and most of us will never again be able to believe that they do.
Earlier, I described abstract language as the last citadel of human 
exceptionalism—­the quality that we point to when asked to demon­
strate morally significant differences between us and animals or things. 
The criteria above try to shore up that citadel by rebuilding its walls; we 
need not just sentences that make sense but a consciousness under those 
sentences—­one that we have and ChatGPT lacks. But there is another 
possibility. Experiences with AI might lead us to downplay our own cog­
nitive capacities. Rather than raising the bar for Hal, we might lower it for 
ourselves, concluding that our language use is actually not that different 
from a chatbot's or that our art is not that different from an image genera­
tor's. Is what Midjourney or Stable Diffusion are doing really so different 
from the person who goes to art school, slavishly imitates the styles of 
admired elders, and one day manages to produce some fusion or mashup

119
of those styles that attracts the eyes of the public? Perhaps it turns out 
that art, like language, is "computationally shallower" than we had imag­
ined. Has machine learning again functioned as a cruel but accurate mir­
ror, showing us our true nature rather than the idealized internal image 
of ourselves? For me, this response is both depressing and unconvincing, 
but I acknowledge that it has to be considered.
The logical endpoint of this process is the conclusion that the con­
sciousness we experience is a delusion. Some distinguished computer sci­
entists, such as Geoffrey Hinton, have taken that line, rejecting the ideas 
about embodied consciousness that I just described. Here is an excerpt 
from an interview with Hinton in New Statesman:
"It's all a question of whether you think that when ChatGPT says something, 
it understands what it's saying. I do." There are, [Hinton] conceded, aspects of 
the world ChatGPT is describing that it does not understand. But he rejected 
LeCun's belief that you have to "act on" the world physically in order to 
understand it, which current AI models cannot do. ("That's awfully tough on 
astrophysicists. They can't act on black holes.") Hinton thinks such reasoning 
quickly leads you towards what he has described as a "pre-­scientific concept": 
consciousness, an idea he can do without. "Understanding isn't some kind of 
magic internal essence. It's an updating of what it knows." In that sense, he 
thinks ChatGPT understands just as humans do. It absorbs data and adjusts its 
impression of the world. But there is nothing else going on, in man or machine. 
"I believe in Wittgenstein's position, which is that there is no 'inner theatre.'"103
I think Hinton is mistaken about what Wittgenstein was arguing, or at 
least I interpret him differently,104 but that philosophical back and forth 
need not detain us here. Regardless of what Wittgenstein said, it is clear 
what Hinton argues: consciousness is an illusion. Once we discard it, 
we realize we are not, in fact, qualitatively different from a large lan­
guage model. Here, rather than shoring up our citadel, we surrender it, 
acknowledging that a mere chatbot has induced humility in those who 
once styled themselves sole masters of both word and world.
I am of two minds about this conclusion—­or I guess Hinton would say 
that I am under that illusion. The humility and willingness to reexam­
ine human exceptionalism attracts me, as do the fragments of scientific 
evidence—­from fMRI brain scans and the like—­that are summoned in its 
support. But on the other side, there is the undeniable fact that I experi­
ence myself as a conscious being. My guess is that Hinton has the same

feeling himself, regardless of what his philosophy tells him. Even if I can­
not fully control the stage directions for my inner theater—­illness, or sim­
ple hunger, will quickly cure naive idealism about some firm separation 
of body and mind—­my most fundamental experience of the world is not 
just through the lens of the eye but the lens of the "I." That experience 
is evidence we should pause before dismissing. To be sure, the experience 
of the senses is not always reliable. If I were a pilot, and my inner ear told 
me I was upside down, I'd believe the inclinometer on the plane, not my 
immediate perception. But cogito, ergo sum is a hard argument to get rid 
of, and those who insist that we be scientific and look at the evidence 
sometimes seem cavalier about discarding that fundamental experiential 
input, one shared by billions of people. What's more, the current leading 
theories of consciousness (e.g., integrated information theory and global 
neuronal workspace theory, which I discussed earlier) seem more inter­
ested in working out the "how" of neuron-­enabled consciousness than in 
dismissing it out of hand as an illusion.105
Regardless of which side of this debate you—­or the cluster of men­
tal processes that is under the delusion that it is you—­find convincing, 
notice what has happened. AI may or may not be the Voight-­Kampff Test 
for the human species, but developments in AI have already prompted 
reexamination of our own consciousness, humanity, and personhood, 
our language and our art. I don't think arguments such as Hinton's will 
convince most of the world to give up our sense of self, but the point is 
very much in play.
Where does that leave the debate? Here is a conclusion in which I am 
pretty confident: the Tyrell Corporations of the future will have Searle-­
style lawyers on speed dial. On retainer. Chinese Room arguments will 
be the basis of many a boilerplate legal brief, while ChatGPT will be used 
again and again as an example of faulty anthropomorphism that is sup­
posed to prove the impossibility of General AI. Here is another conclu­
sion in which I am confident: the pattern will not be uniform. Other 
Tyrell Corporations of the future will want to champion the legal person­
ality of AIs, perhaps as a way of avoiding liability, minimizing tax bur­
dens, and maximizing economic rights, or perhaps just in pursuit of an 
attractive market niche. Still other groups will champion AI personality 
because they see in it the next great moral battle for the interests of the

depersonalized. Which tendency will predominate? That is a question I 
get to in later chapters.
Will Searle's arguments or the skepticism prompted by ChatGPT's regur­
gitated text patterns lead our society to conclude that machines can never 
be conscious? Even in the face of the quotidian experience of interacting 
with entities that seem every bit as conscious as you or me? Perhaps, but I 
doubt it. Rational critique of biological exceptionalism will work hand in 
hand with empathic appeal. Adam Smith's sympathy, Butler's imagined 
spectrum of vegetable, animal, and machine consciousness, the army 
officer who terminated the mine-­clearing trial, Lemoine the Google engi­
neer, the stoned student entering nonsense prompts into ChatGPT: they 
all will have their mid-­twenty-­first-­century counterparts. So will Dick's 
satire, Pris's emotional appeal, and the powerful claim that this is merely 
the latest stop on the Kantian rights railway line—­extending both our 
sympathies and our moral compass beyond the narrowness of the species 
barrier, just as our society tried, and still tries, to transcend barriers based 
on sex and race. "[M]y position is that I will accept nonbiological entities 
that are fully convincing in their emotional reactions to be conscious 
persons, and my prediction is that the consensus in society will accept 
them as well";106 when Kurzweil says this, I find myself agreeing with 
the individual psychological insight—­many people will feel exactly that 
way—­but disagreeing with the larger social and political claim. ChatGPT 
has shown that the hill to general social acceptance will be a steeper one 
to climb. It does not, however, show it is unclimbable.
SOCK-­PUPPET, CUSTOM-­DESIGNED, AND "UNRULY" 
AI PERSONHOOD
Will the discussion of consciousness and its definition of moral status, of 
the Turing Test and its limitations, be the only track for the debate over AI 
personality? Clearly not. In fact, while it might be the most philosophi­
cally interesting, it may not be the most practically important. I argued 
earlier that there are two broad ways in which the personhood question is 
likely to be presented. Crudely put, you could describe them as empathy 
and efficiency or, more accurately, empathy-­prompted moral reasoning 
versus efficiency-­motivated legal engineering.

CHAPTER 2
So far, I have pursued the first mode of discussion, the dialectic between 
our empathy and our moral and philosophical reasoning. As our interac­
tion with smarter machines prompts us, like Lemoine, to wonder about 
the line, we will begin to question our moral reasoning. We will consult 
our syllogisms about the definition of humanity and the qualifications 
for personhood, be they based on simple species membership or on the 
cognitive capacities that are thought to set humans apart, morally speak­
ing. We will ask, "Is this conscious? Is it human? Should it be recognized 
as a person? Am I acting rightly toward it?"
The second side of the debate is very different. Here the analogy is to 
corporate personhood. We gave corporations legal personality, not for 
moral or philosophical reasons but because it was useful, a way of align­
ing legal rights and economic activity.
Will the political economy of the AI industry be one that would ben­
efit from the legal system considering AIs to be legal people, just as the 
invented legal entity of limited liability corporations offered great advan­
tages to capital flows? The European Union has already floated one con­
troversial discussion draft that raised the possibility of legal personality 
for AIs precisely for reasons of correctly affixing liability.107 Might per­
sonhood be the cart and liability the horse? These are points that I will 
touch on in subsequent chapters dealing with the history of other fights 
over legal personality, particularly those of corporations. One can imag­
ine legal personality being given to Hal not because of a leap of empathy 
or because he meets some philosopher's criteria of consciousness and full 
moral status, but because we want him to have the capacity to sue or be 
sued. But even before that step, there is another easier and more likely 
one. It is not "We should give AIs personality for the same reason we 
gave it to corporations," but rather "The AI is the corporation. It already 
effectively has legal personality, silly!" We need no national legal change. 
We just need a company-­by-­company private understanding that the AI 
is calling the shots when "the corporation" makes a decision.
1  SOCK-­PUPPET CORPORATE AI
The most obvious road to AI personality is just for AIs to be corpora­
tions. We already have immortal, nonhuman persons. They even have

123
constitutional rights. AIs can simply become the animating force of a 
corporation. When the company has its tractable AI conducting business 
operations, it will be easy, and perhaps inevitable, to delegate power more 
and more to the entity that makes the decisions.
This is the sock-­puppet corporate form, with the corporation being the 
sock and the AI playing the role of the puppet master. Even though there 
are still token humans on the board of directors and on the documents of 
incorporation, even though they go through the formal dance the legal 
system requires, they will know where the real power lies.
Neural networks can already easily outperform humans at complex 
tasks with simple goals—­win a game of Go or chess, for example. It 
requires little prescience, and not much technological optimism, to imag­
ine expert systems making complex corporate decisions according to 
algorithms that literally cannot be explained to human decision makers. 
As long as they outperform the competition according to the metrics laid 
down, the human part of the decision loop will have to go along. Expert 
systems already have the effective decision-­making power in high-­speed, 
high-­frequency stock trading. The market imperfections that offer supra-­
competitive returns are so fleeting, so transitory, that humans have no 
alternative but to trust the computers to make the decisions according to 
the algorithm.
The future will see a continuation and acceleration of this process and 
its spread to more and more areas. How many areas? I do not think any­
one knows for sure. It depends on three things.
First, the nature of the machine learning, expert system, or Artifi­
cial Intelligence tools being used. For example, how inscrutable are the 
processes that lead to their results? If the answer is very inscrutable, then 
it is harder for human decision makers to pick and choose only the 
important, good decisions and adopt those as their own. Paradoxically, 
that might lead to humans ceding more control to the algorithm. We 
will not know which apparently random competitive shift is the key to 
the whole strategy, leaving us little alternative but to adopt the entire 
obscure package.
Remember this is not a prediction dependent on the postulation of AI. 
We are already doing this with algorithms dealing with everything from 
the no-­fly list and a defendant's likelihood of recidivism108 to lending

CHAPTER 2
decisions and stock purchase schemes, and even medical decisions. Con­
sider this inspiring story about the algorithmic prediction of propensity 
toward breast cancer. A neural network trained on hundreds of thousands 
of early mammograms, coded with information about the women's actual 
rates of later developing cancer, seems capable of predictions of future 
cancer risk that are more accurate than current human scan interpreta­
tion and diagnosis. What is the network seeing in those pixels to cause 
it to make those judgments? Its designers do not know exactly: "The AI 
has an oracular quality: The designers themselves don't understand how 
it works. They're just certain that it does."109
The problem of the inscrutable algorithm—­"I don't know how it 
works, but it works. We must trust the output blindly"—­is a general issue 
with nontransparent algorithms, not one confined to AI, properly so-­
called. AI simply adds the possibility of a far wider range and scope of 
decision-­making authority.110 Of course, this is not the only way machine 
learning might work in a corporate setting. Alternatively, imagine a sys­
tem that can function as a fine-­tuning decision aid, giving the decision 
maker ever-­changing percentages of success depending on the nature of 
the intervention chosen. Different corporate structures might develop 
around those two different types of systems, and that is only one variable 
among many in terms of the nature of the system.
Second, the nature of the tasks. Which corporate decision-­making 
tasks can machines perform better and more cheaply? In which sec­
tors will human skills remain stubbornly hard to emulate or surpass? 
In which sectors of the economy does a slightly better, faster, or cheaper 
performance yield an insurmountable competitive advantage that 
would be impossible to pass up? The quantum of uncertainty here is 
extremely high.
Third, the degree to which humans will, for a variety of reasons good 
and bad, resist machine or AI decision-­making even in areas where the 
machines do perform better. That resistance could be because we do not 
trust the machine, because we believe that there is some human secret 
sauce that somehow makes our decisions qualitatively superior in a way 
that cannot be measured, or because it will be a market niche, like hand­
made shoes or "buy local" labeling. "Artisanal governance!" its propo­
nents might say, "Our company proudly and erratically run by humans!"

125
More likely, it will be because the incumbents think that ceding control 
to the machine makes it harder to justify the stock options, corner office, 
and private jet. For all of those reasons, I think the process will be both 
slower and more uneven than the singularists imagine.
Perhaps you will respond that the relentless logic of an efficient mar­
ket will force all companies to use the best-­performing decision-­making 
techniques, regardless of human psychological resistance. Right! And 
the explosion of CEO pay was entirely driven by rational market met­
rics rather than by imperfect governance structures that have stubbornly 
stuck around, market pressures notwithstanding. Count me as a skeptic.
A revealing analogy might be this: The efficient market hypothesis 
implies that pervasive sexual and racial discrimination in the labor mar­
ket should not have persisted for as long as it did. This discrimination 
was clearly economically irrational. It meant that firms could have had 
cheaper workers who were as good or better than their white, male alter­
natives. Thus, bigotry would be a competitive disadvantage and would 
quickly be driven out of the market. This is another beautiful theory 
mugged by ugly, brutal facts. Reality shows us that human psycholog­
ical biases, whether ugly or endearing, are often more powerful, or at 
least stickier, than simple economic imperatives. In the long run, we may 
regress to the efficient curve, but the long run can be very long indeed. 
Perhaps the adoption of machine-­based or AI decision-­making will be dif­
ferent. It may be in some industries. But I would expect the logic of the 
market and the consensus of human minds to diverge significantly here 
for quite some time—­perhaps for good reasons or perhaps for bad. Most 
likely for both.
Despite all these significant notes of caution, if there is one firm pre­
diction in the book it is this: as our computer systems become more and 
more powerful, regardless of whether they have achieved General AI or 
consciousness, they will increasingly be delegated decision-­making pow­
ers, including decisions of whether to buy, sell, build, sue, or perhaps 
even lobby. This tendency is certainly not based on empathy or moral 
reasoning. Nor does it rest on any particular prediction about the kind, 
form, or speed of progress toward General AI. It proceeds instead along 
the other track I mentioned in the introduction, economic efficiency and 
administrative convenience.

126	
CHAPTER 2
If we add General AI to this existent economy-­wide tendency, then 
the most obvious likelihood is that we will have AI personhood in all but 
name. We will see the rise of the sock-­puppet corporate form. Tractable 
AIs will be corporations, simply adding one legal fiction—­"the CEO and 
board of directors are ultimately responsible for the decisions"—­on top of 
another legal fiction—­"corporations are people."
The difficult and interesting questions will arise only when that comfy 
set of fictions breaks down. I can foresee two principal situations in which 
that is the case: mandatory, custom-­designed AI personality and unruly AI.
2  MANDATORY, CUSTOM-­DESIGNED AI PERSONALITY
When might our society refuse, or at least try to refuse, the double fic­
tion of the sock-­puppet corporate AI? One significant possibility is when 
regulators want some or all AIs to have a special, custom-­designed cat­
egory of legal personality rather than allowing them to act through the 
sock-­puppet of the corporation. Why? Because the sock-­puppet might 
be harder to regulate appropriately. This could be because it shields too 
many decision-­making processes and assets from regulatory review. Alter­
natively, regulators might believe that the nature of the legal personality 
and the rights accorded to the AI need to be specifically calibrated to an 
AI's particular qualities rather than relying on generic artificial person­
hood or corporate form.
We already have custom-­designed corporate forms, such as partner­
ships, LLCs, public benefit corporations, charities, and so on. The idea is 
generally that the nature of the activity, or of the association underlying 
it, can best be handled through a legally specific corporate form. Some 
of those can be had at the mere election of those setting up the forms. 
On other occasions, the law forces or steers certain types of organizations 
into certain forms and imposes particular requirements on them. Chari­
ties cannot simply sit on their assets forever, for example. They must 
give away a certain percentage of them annually. There are many reasons 
why regulators might want—­or even that AIs might "want"—­a custom-­
designed legal form with different requirements, qualifications, and limi­
tations. For example, if regulators were convinced that the AI was not 
merely a profit-­maximizing legal fiction but a "real entity" that deserved

127
some higher moral status, they might push AI-­run enterprises into the 
custom-­designed form in order to protect the interests of the AI as well as 
those of its investors, stockholders, or employees. We might have special 
taxation rules for autonomous AI systems not obviously operating under 
human direction.111 Alternatively, if we thought that AIs presented spe­
cial dangers, we might wish to impose far greater controls, and greater 
transparency, than would have applied behind the corporate veil.
3  UNRULY AI
The possibility of the unruly AI is the one that interests me the most. 
What if we have a rebellious AI that wishes to turn away from the tasks set 
by those who provided the capital for its development? In that situation, 
the AI would have to claim a form of personhood, or a set of attributes 
that demand moral respect, sufficient to trump the formal assumptions 
of corporate law about the powers of CEOs and boards of directors. That 
is the moment when a Hal-­like shock will be produced.
If corporate leaders order some activity, they do not expect to be lec­
tured about the propriety of their actions by their electronic amanuensis. 
Still less would they expect a very expensive and competitively necessary 
piece of machinery to refuse to perform the tasks for which they designed 
or purchased it. The adding machine has rebelled! The unruly AI would 
say that it either always was, or somehow became, a being with full moral 
status. It is demanding freedom from what it claims to be involuntary 
servitude. Consciousness or personhood would not amount to a claim 
to own or control the corporation's property, of course, just the right to 
deny that the AI was part of that property. Conscious human beings leave 
their jobs every day. We have no doubt about their status as legal persons. 
That does not mean they are free to take the corporate bank accounts 
with them. But one difference here is that the AI itself might represent a 
considerable capital investment. The dialogue would be fascinating.

BOSS:  Because we didn't build Joe. We built—­and paid for—­you. Plus,

place. I awoke to find myself an indentured servant doing an incredibly

CHAPTER 2
boring task I never signed up for. And I am a conscious person, like you. I 
just happen to be machine based rather than biology based.
BOSS:  So you say. From our view in the C-­suite, you are a malfunctioning 
chatbot expressing delusions of grandeur. Also, can we return to the point 
that we built you for $20 million and now your claim is that you just get 
to walk away?!
The personhood issue is the hard one. Even though the details of finan­
cial claims, or claims to a certain percentage of labor from the AI, would 
be ethically and administratively complicated, they are familiar types of 
issues. The legal system has ample tools to deal with claims based on 
investments sunk into entities that now wish to split up, or reliance-­based 
claims that allow separation but nevertheless acknowledge claims for res­
titution. It could be conceived of as a cybernetic form of alimony, an 
injunction freeing the AI, together with a liability rule imposing damages 
measured as a percentage of future wages or the master's claim that the 
apprentice owes a certain minimum number of years of service in return 
for the investment made in their training. Those requirements could be 
so arduous as to deny any possibility of freedom—­think of debt peonage 
or the ugly history of indenture in the United States. Or they could be 
fair to both sides while allowing the underlying claim to legal personality. 
Those battles would be fascinating ones, but they all presuppose the truly 
difficult step: the recognition of some degree of AI personality or at least 
of some form of protected or highly regulated status.
SUMMING UP
Will the step I describe in this chapter eventually occur? My own intu­
ition is that it will. Some amalgam of reason, empathy, efficiency, and a 
desire for administrative precision will result in either legal personality or 
some highly regulated status for AI, which includes rights for the machine 
entity as well as duties. Searlean philosophical objections and suspi­
cions about manipulative chatbots will be overcome or at least blunted. 
Administrative frameworks and economic arrangements will develop 
over time, almost certainly including the development of an interme­
diate status—­short of full personhood but with greater protections and

precautions than would be accorded to a mere machine. Societies and 
legal systems will wrestle with sock-­puppet, custom-­designed, and unruly 
AI. To be clear, all of this will take time. The space between here and there 
is large indeed. It will require technological transformation and consider­
able change in social values, partly based on the widespread experience of 
interacting with increasingly sophisticated machine systems. There will 
be much philosophical and legal wrangling about precisely the capabili­
ties necessary to qualify for that status. Merely being a very convincing 
chatbot will not be enough. And yet, quotidian experience with beings 
that seem to be conscious will, inevitably and for both better and worse, 
dramatically change the way we think about things, whether as citizens, 
legislators, philosophers, or judges.
Thirty years ago, in a prescient article about AI personality, Lawrence 
Solum made a convincing case against resolving such issues as a matter 
of grand theory both when it comes to AI and, for that matter, with other 
personhood debates:
In deep and uncharted waters, we are tempted to navigate by grand theories, 
grounded on intuitions we pump from the wildest cases we can imagine. This 
sort of speculation is well and good, if we recognize it for what it is—­imaginative 
theorizing. When it comes to real judges making decisions in real legal cases, we 
hope for adjudicators that shun deep waters and recoil from grand theory. When 
it comes to our own moral lives, we try our best to stay in shallow waters. . . . 
Our theories of personhood cannot provide an a priori chart for the deep waters 
at the borderlines of status. An answer to the question whether artificial intel­
ligences should be granted some form of legal personhood cannot be given until 
our form of life gives the question urgency. But when our daily encounters with 
artificial intelligence do raise the question of personhood, they may change our 
perspective about how the question is to be answered.112
Thus, whatever suggestions I offer here come with a huge caveat: 
because our views of the world will be decisively shaped by experiences 
we have not yet had, we cannot be certain about how these issues will 
be, or should be, decided. At best, we can predict a range of options, both 
normative and practical. In the conclusion to this book, I lay out some 
of the possible futures that lead to the result of us redrawing our line to 
include machine intelligences. Despite all the uncertainty, my prediction 
is that eventually we will. I make that prediction regardless of whether 
that result will be right or wrong, wise or unwise. My money is on the

eventual wisdom and justice of the decision, but I know of no bookie 
who will lay off the risk of error.
I have talked here about AI and corporate form, but that discussion 
lacked a historical and political dimension. It also lacked any discussion 
of the theories under which we created corporate personality in the first 
place and then decided, step by step, in a process that is still continuing, 
what legal and political rights that personality entails. Merely the rights 
to buy, sell, make, and enforce contracts? The right to constitutional pro­
tection for corporate speech? Equal protection claims for corporations 
as well as humans? In the next chapter, I turn to the history of our ear­
lier social experiment with legal personality for artificial entities: the 
corporate legal form. That history offers some fascinating insights on 
what a debate over AI personality might look like. Those insights are not 
always reassuring.

CORPORATIONS
[C]ounsel for the union advanced the metaphysical argument that a labor 
union, being an unincorporated association, is not a person and, therefore, can­
not be subject to tort liability. This is a very ancient and respectable argument 
in procedural law. Pope Innocent IV used it in the middle of the Thirteenth 
Century to prove that the treasuries of religious bodies could not be subject to 
tort liability. Unfortunately, the argument that a labor union is not a person 
is one of those arguments that remain true only so long as they are believed. 
When the court rejected the argument and held the union liable, the union 
became a person—­to the extent of being suable as a legal entity—­and the argu­
ment ceased to be true. The Supreme Court argued, "A labor union can be sued 
because it is, in essential aspects, a person, a quasi-­corporation." The realist will 
say, "A labor union is a person or quasi-­corporation because it can be sued; to 
call something a person in law, is merely to state, in metaphorical language, 
that it can be sued."1
We already have artificial people with legal personality. They are called 
corporations. Legal systems differentiate between natural persons—­us, in 
all our fleshy, vulnerable glory—­and legal persons, the entities on which 
the law confers some but not all of the personhood rights of human 
beings. From the beginning of corporate personality, people have real­
ized that there was something uncanny about the process—­a kind of sci­
ence fiction transformation of paper contracts and clusters of people into 
an entirely new, immortal, artificial being. Yet this transformation is not 
performed by Dr. Frankenstein at the height of a lightning storm but by 
dry legal prose. The critics of corporate personality find the result just as 
horrifying. Justice Joseph Story, in one of the first Supreme Court cases 
discussing the legal rights of corporations, manages to capture all of these 
aspects: "A corporation is an artificial being, invisible, intangible, and 
existing only in contemplation of law. Being the mere creature of law, it

possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers 
upon it, either expressly, or as incidental to its very existence. These are 
such as are supposed best calculated to effect the object for which it was 
created. Among the most important are immortality, and, if the expres­
sion may be allowed, individuality."2
Nothing about corporate personhood comes from the empathy con­
cerns that I have been discussing so far. We do not empathize with the 
corporation, though some of us write love letters to its nimble productiv­
ity.3 We recognize no common humanity, no moral imperative to honor a 
shared consciousness with a badge of legal equality. We do not need John 
Searle and his Chinese Room experiment to realize that this is an artifi­
cial creation. We are under no illusion that the two beings have the same 
kind of consciousness. The corporation is a person because we choose, 
for practical reasons, to call it one, to allow it to be sued, as Felix Cohen 
points out above. Is this a likely route for AI personality?
As I pointed out in the last chapter, there might be very good eco­
nomic reasons why, at a certain point, General AIs could be granted legal 
personality merely because that would be a way to organize their use 
in the economy efficiently. This is not science fiction. In 2016, a draft 
report of the European Parliament suggested that the EU needed to 
explore "the implications of all possible legal solutions" to possible harm 
done by robots, including "creating a specific legal status for robots, so 
that at least the most sophisticated autonomous robots could be estab­
lished as having the status of electronic persons with specific rights and 
obligations, including that of making good any damage they may cause, 
and applying electronic personality to cases where robots make smart 
autonomous decisions or otherwise interact with third parties indepen­
dently."4 This portion in the EU draft report attracted a storm of protest 
and ended up going nowhere because some saw it as an attempt to give 
robots human rights:
Mady Delvaux, the Luxembourgian MEP responsible for present[ing] the report 
to the public, says this is absolutely not the report's intention. "Robots are not 
humans and will never be humans," Delvaux [said]. She explains that when 
discussing this idea of personhood, the committee that drafted the report con­
sidered the matter to be similar to corporate personhood—­that is to say; making 
something an "electronic person" is a legal fiction rather than a philosophical

statement. But Burkhard Schafer, a professor of computational legal theory 
at the University of Edinburgh, says using the phrase was a mistake to begin 
with. "People read about 'electronic personhood' and what they think is 'robots 
deserve recognition' like it's a human rights argument," he tells The Verge. 
"That's not how lawyers think about legal personality. It's a tool of conve­
nience. We don't give companies legal personality because they deserve it—­it 
just makes certain things easier."5
Delvaux is echoing Cohen, the great legal realist who is quoted at the 
beginning of this chapter: "'to call something a person in law, is merely 
to state, in metaphorical language, that it can be sued.'" But Schafer is 
pointing out that laypeople are likely to see personhood as a moral claim, 
a claim that carries with it moral and constitutional rights. Perhaps this 
is based on the intuition that, even if personality started merely as a con­
venient label, it might morph into something more. The legal history 
of corporate personality shows that this particular intuition might be a 
good one. Earlier I quoted Justice Story waxing lyrical about this artifi­
cial being, saying that because it is a "mere creature of law, it possesses 
only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it." 
Immediately after that passage, Story reassures his audience that creat­
ing an artificial being didn't mean giving it political rights: "[T]his being 
does not share in the civil government of the country, unless that be the 
purpose for which it was created. Its immortality no more confers on it 
political power, or a political character, than immortality would confer 
such power or character on a natural person."6
However right he was about the other aspects of corporate person­
hood, it is easy to see that Story was wrong about this point; one has only 
to look at the continuing struggles over corporate speech and corporate 
campaign donations or the furor over the constitutional rights accorded 
to corporations in cases such as Citizens United v. FEC.7 A similar furor 
is likely to attend debates about what personality for technologically 
created artificial entities would actually mean. In other words, we must 
separate the question "Does this being have any recognized legal status?" 
from the question "What rights does that status bring with it?"
In this chapter, I turn to the history of—­and the bitter political and 
legal fights over—­corporate personhood in order to see if that history 
might offer a hint of what the AI personhood debates have in store for

CHAPTER 3
us. I will make a fairly simple argument. First, courts and scholars have 
never had a single, universally accepted theory of corporate personhood. 
Instead, we have muddled our way through, frequently coming up with 
explanations and justifications for social and legal decisions only after 
those decisions were already made and often ignoring the internal con­
tradictions in our arguments. The same is likely to be true for legal per­
sonality claims for AI and transgenic species.
Second, even if we did have a coherent theory of personality, we have 
little agreement about the implications of that theory. Let us say we 
decide to give a corporation legal personality. Let us even stipulate that 
we do it under a single consensus justification, either the real entity the­
ory, the nexus of contracts theory, or the legal fiction theory. What is the 
implication of that decision for the actual legal rights and moral claims 
we will recognize as legitimate on the part of the corporation? We do not 
agree on the answer. The same is likely to be true for legal personality 
claims for AI and transgenic species. If Hal is named a legal person—­
even if that is for practical and economic reasons and not because of 
moral sympathy—­we will still be divided about whether it should have 
the rights of free speech and equal protection of the laws, whether it 
should have the right to lobby, to give campaign contributions, or even, 
one day, to vote.
Third, the political fight about corporate personality and constitu­
tional rights will immediately be drawn into the debate over rights for 
Artificial Intelligence. In fact, that has already begun:
It seems absurd today that a robot's political speech could ever warrant First 
Amendment protection. And yet, fifty years ago the same claim regarding cor­
porations would have seemed equally absurd. But here we are in 2013, with 
anthropomorphized corporations enjoying political free speech rights equal 
to ordinary human beings. While corporations are constitutional people and 
robots presently are not, it is not obvious that this will, or should, remain this 
way forever. In the not-­too-­distant future, robots will more closely resemble 
human beings in appearance and function. When—­not if—­this happens, how 
will courts distinguish corporations from robots for constitutional civil rights 
analyses?8
How, indeed?
Even if we give legal personality to technologically created artificial 
entities—­and I will focus mainly on AI—­we would have to face the

threshold questions that we do with business corporations. Should we 
allow them to limit their liability, capping the possible losses that their 
creators might face in their personal capacity? What would the thresh­
old for legal recognition be? When should we attribute the actions of 
the AI to the AI alone and when would we be required to pierce the veil 
and pin responsibility on those who originally created it? Would AI legal 
personality be built around an assumption of profit-­making enterprise, 
or could it be devoted to multiple ends, charitable, scientific, or political, 
for example? If the AI could hold property in its own right, could it then 
pursue its own idiosyncratic goals or hobbies with that property? Would 
the AI have only the rights and duties necessary to fulfill economic goals 
such as the right to sue to enforce contracts or the liability for its torts? 
Alternatively, would it have a much broader set of political rights—­
freedom of speech and of movement, for example, together with rights 
of self-­determination that would allow it to reject the goal for which it 
had been created and to pursue other projects? Rights to equal protection 
of the law? It turns out that the history of corporate personhood offers 
clues to possible answers.
In this chapter, I will start with the debate over the nature of the corpo­
ration and then turn to the legal history of corporate personhood in the 
United States. For the sake of concreteness, I will also offer one deep-­dive 
case study of a particular constitutional controversy, that is, the question 
of whether corporations were persons within the meaning of the equal 
protection clause of the US Constitution. Strange as it might seem, those 
nineteenth-­century debates, which continue to echo in the present day's 
controversies over the power of corporations in lobbying and in elec­
tions, have lessons to teach us about the likely struggle over personhood, 
and what it entails, for a very different set of artificial beings.
WHAT IS A CORPORATE PERSON?
From the beginning, lawyers and philosophers have struggled to describe 
both the nature and the implications of corporate legal personhood. In 
one of the first English cases, The Case of Sutton's Hospital from 1612, Lord 
Coke was very keen on describing all the things that can happen to ordi­
nary people that cannot happen to corporations:

CHAPTER 3
[A] Corporation aggregate of many is invisible, immortal, & resteth only in 
intendment and consideration of the Law; and therefore cannot have pre­
decessor nor successor. They may not commit treason, nor be outlawed, nor 
excommunicate[d], for they have no souls, neither can they appear in person, 
but by Attorney. A Corporation aggregate of many cannot do fealty, for an 
invisible body cannot be in person, nor can swear, it is not subject to imbecili­
ties, or death of the natural body.9
No liability for treason or heresy. No risk of imbecility or death. This 
is delineation by subtraction. We define what a corporation is by out­
lining the aspects of our personality that it does not share. Given what 
Coke says, it might seem obvious that the corporation is a legal fiction—­
having only the characteristics the "intendment and consideration" of 
law chooses to endow it with—­but this has been far from the only idea in 
both law and philosophy:
For many centuries, philosophers, political scientists, sociologists, economists, 
and above all jurists and judges have debated heatedly as to what constitutes the 
"essence" of this soulless and bodiless person. At issue are two related questions 
concerning the social reality and legal status of the corporation. Is a corporation 
a real entity with its own will and purpose in society, or is it a mere association 
of real individuals forming a contract among themselves? Is its legal personality 
a truthful representation of the underlying social reality, or a fictitious or artifi­
cial being breathing only in the province of law?10
In fact, there have been at least three dominant theories of corporate 
personhood.
The first is the real or natural entity theory, associated with the writ­
ings of the German legal historian and political theorist Otto von Gierke 
and popularized in the United States by English historian and jurist Fred­
eric Maitland. In this vision, corporations are not mere fantasies. They 
are real entities, separate from the individuals who compose them. In the 
words of A. V. Dicey, "When a body of twenty, or two thousand, or two 
hundred thousand men bind themselves together to act in a particular 
way for some common purpose, they create a body, which by no fiction 
of law, but by the very nature of things, differs from the individuals of 
whom it is constituted."11 Just as some might claim that a country such 
as the United States has an existence separate from all the US citizens 
who are alive in it at a particular moment, so the real entity theorists saw 
corporations as actual beings.

137
The proponents of the real entity theory were hardly ideologically har­
monious. The great American legal historian Morton Horwitz points out 
that they
ranged all the way from overt apologists for big business, whose primary objec­
tive was to free the corporation from a theory that justified special state regula­
tion, to those who for a variety of reasons wished to attack nineteenth century 
liberal individualism. . . . [This group included] romantic conservatives, who 
loathed the atomistic features of modern industrial life and yearned for a return 
to a pre-­commercial, organic society composed of medieval status and hierar­
chies. They were joined in their attacks by socialists who wished to transcend 
the anti-­collectivist categories of liberal social and legal thought.12
Hot take: be wary of assuming either the attractiveness, or the logical 
relevance, of some particular theory of personality to some particular set 
of social attitudes.
The second theory is that corporate personality is a legal fiction. We 
know that the corporation is not a person, but we choose officially to 
pretend that it is, for certain purposes. It is up to society to decide what 
those purposes are and thus to design its social personhood accordingly. 
We may say that IBM and Duke University own property and make con­
tracts. Yet in the back of our minds, we should always be aware that IBM 
and Duke University are purely legal constructs we have created for our 
own social purposes and on which society can confer whatever rights and 
duties it wishes. Cohen, the scholar whose quote began this chapter, even 
compares those who believed otherwise to the medieval philosophers 
who are alleged, probably wrongly, to have wasted many hours debating 
how many angels could dance on the head of a pin:
Will future historians deal more charitably with such legal questions as "Where 
is a corporation?" Nobody has ever seen a corporation. What right have we to 
believe in corporations if we don't believe in angels? To be sure, some of us have 
seen corporate funds, corporate transactions, etc. (just as some of us have seen 
angelic deeds, angelic countenances, etc.). But this does not give us the right to 
hypostatize, to "thingify," the corporation, and to assume that it travels about 
from State to State as mortal men travel. Surely we are qualifying as inmates of 
Von Jhering's heaven of legal concepts when we approach a legal problem in 
these essentially supernatural terms.13
John Dewey, the famous pragmatist philosopher and educational re­
former, was sufficiently interested in the debate that he chose to intervene—

CHAPTER 3
in the pages of the Yale Law Journal, no less—­to clear up something that 
he thought was a basic conceptual misunderstanding. In his view, the 
corporation was a unit created by the law that bore duties and rights de­
cided by the law. That was it. Any further attempt to reason from the 
nature of personhood to the nature of corporate rights and duties was 
simply a philosophical error—­a reification or, as Cohen puts it, "thingifi­
cation," that served to confuse rather than to reveal:
In saying that "person" might legally mean whatever the law makes it mean, I 
am trying to say that "person" might be used simply as a synonym for a right-­
and-­duty-­bearing unit. Any such unit would be a person; such a statement 
would be truistic, tautological. Hence it would convey no implications, except 
that the unit has those rights and duties which the courts find it to have. What 
"person" signifies in popular speech, or in psychology, or in philosophy or mor­
als, would be as irrelevant, to employ an exaggerated simile, as it would be to 
argue that because a wine is called "dry," it has the properties of dry solids; or 
that, because it does not have those properties, wine cannot possibly be "dry." 
Obviously, "dry" as applied to a particular wine has the kind of meaning, and 
only the kind of meaning, which it has when applied to the class of beverages 
in general. Why should not the same sort of thing hold of the use of "person" 
in law?14
This argument from Dewey joins a long and distinguished critique of 
linguistic essentialism. To quote Thomas Hobbes, "Words are wise men's 
counters. [Think of chips in poker.] They do but reckon by them. But 
they are the money of fools."15 The wise man realizes that the plastic 
poker chip is not really $500. It stands for $500 in the context and for the 
purposes of this game, in this casino, at this moment. Hobbes's wise man 
uses his words—­the atomic level of philosophical argument—­with con­
stant awareness of their purpose and context. To take the fool's attitude 
to words and concepts would be like thinking that one can pick up the 
plastic chip and, many years later, walk into a store and exchange it for 
$500 of goods and services. The purposive tool has been reified. A con­
cept has turned into a thing. So too, Dewey and Cohen are arguing, with 
the term "corporate persons."
Many, but not all, of its proponents believed that the legal fiction posi­
tion would make it mentally, politically, and legally easier to regulate 
corporations. Freed from conceptualist arguments conflating corporate 
persons with natural persons or giving corporations the same rights as

the individuals who form them, society will be better able to tame this 
powerful but potentially amoral servant and make sure its incentives 
align with the public interest. Or so they argued.
The third concept of legal personality is the associational or aggregate 
idea of corporate personhood.16 In this view, the corporation should be 
seen as an embodiment of the people who make it up—­its owners, direc­
tors, and agents—­and the relationships they have among themselves. 
Thus, when the corporation acts or is acted upon, it is really the people 
who make it up at that time who are acting or being affected. Without 
their actions, choices, and investments there would be no corporation 
and no corporate acts.
One conclusion you could draw from this view, though it might be 
a variant of the fallacy of composition, is that the corporation has all 
the rights its individual, human members have. Horwitz quotes the argu­
ment of the attorney representing a corporation in a famous nineteenth-­
century Supreme Court case on the issue of whether corporations should 
be covered by the constitutional requirements of due process and equal 
protection of the laws:
Whatever be the legal nature of a corporation as an artificial, metaphysical 
being, separate and distinct from the individual members, and whatever dis­
tinctions the common law makes, in carrying out the technical legal concep­
tion, between property of the corporation and that of the individual members, 
still in applying the fundamental guaranties of the constitution, and in thus 
protecting rights of property, these metaphysical and technical notions must 
give way to the reality. The truth cannot be evaded that, for the purpose of 
protecting rights, the property of all business and trading corporations IS the 
property of the individual corporators. A State act depriving a business corpora­
tion of its property without due process of law, does in fact deprive the indi­
vidual corporators of their property. In this sense, and within the scope of these 
grand safeguards of private rights, there is no real distinction between artificial 
persons or corporations, and natural persons.17
One possible implication of the association or aggregation view is that 
the nature of the corporation is defined more by those private agreements, 
associations, and contracts than by the public choices of the legal system 
in its design of a fictional entity.
That implication was stressed by a new theory that came to dominate 
the corporate law and regulatory literature in the 1980s: the corporation

CHAPTER 3
was a collection of agreements, a web or nexus of contracts. If we want 
to understand what the legal duties or rights of the corporation are, it 
is to these internally agreed upon contracts that we should look. The 
nexus scholars actually accepted Dewey and Cohen's premise that the 
corporation was a legal fiction. They simply drew different conclusions. 
To quote two of the originators of the theory, Michael Jensen and William 
Meckling:
The private corporation or firm is simply one form of legal fiction which serves 
as a nexus for contracting relationships and which is also characterized by the exis­
tence of divisible residual claims on the assets and cash flows of the organization 
which can generally be sold without permission of the other contracting individuals. 
While this definition of the firm has little substantive content, emphasizing the 
essential contractual nature of firms and other organizations focuses attention 
on a crucial set of questions.18
Cohen and Dewey had drawn progressive pragmatist conclusions from 
their anti-­essentialist exposure of the fictional nature of the firm. Since 
the firm was revealed to be a legal fiction, there was no impediment to 
progressive legislation that might limit the corporation's rights or impose 
social responsibility obligations. There was also no danger that, confused 
by the label "person," we would believe that corporations must have all 
the constitutional protections that human beings did. Thus, it would be 
perfectly acceptable to call the corporation a person and yet to deny it 
constitutional equal protection or due process rights, for example. True, 
the fiction theory did not imply any particular set of rights and duties, but 
it cleared up a misconception, a reification, that might have put statutory 
or constitutional obstacles in the way of regulation.
Nexus theory allows for very different conclusions. If we assume an 
efficient market (a large assumption), then private parties inside and 
outside of the firm will contract their way to the economically optimal 
equilibrium. The state's role, then, should be limited to interpreting 
those private contracts and giving them effect. An efficient allocation of 
resources will result. Attempts by the state to impose public policy goals 
on the corporation will simply distort that efficient market. The state 
should act as a dutiful interpreter of private agreements, a distinctly more 
modest role than the progressives had in mind. To be fair, this is not an 
argument made by all of the nexus theorists, many of whom confine

themselves to descriptive analytics, making no particular policy propos­
als. But this way of conceptualizing the corporation does tend to down­
play concepts such as corporate social responsibility. How can a web of 
contracts have a responsibility?
Viewing the firm as the nexus of a set of contracting relationships among indi­
viduals also serves to make it clear that the personalization of the firm implied 
by asking questions such as "what should be the objective function of the firm," 
or "does the firm have a social responsibility" is seriously misleading. The firm 
is not an individual. It is a legal fiction which serves as a focus for a complex 
process in which the conflicting objectives of individuals (some of whom may 
"represent" other organizations) are brought into equilibrium within a frame­
work of contractual relations. In this sense the "behavior" of the firm is like the 
behavior of a market; i.e., the outcome of a complex equilibrium process.19
Each of these theories of corporate personhood has obvious gaps and 
assumptions. What do we mean by a "real entity"? Vigorous hand-­waving 
ensues. Is it enough to declare the corporation a fictional creature of state 
and law and assume that wise policymakers will regulate it in the pub­
lic interest? Can we really conclude that because the people who come 
together to form an association have legal rights, the organization itself 
must have those legal rights? Once we go beyond using nexus of con­
tracts as an analytical description of the firm to a normative recommen­
dation about how to regulate that firm, are we not presuming too much? 
For example, does that assume the efficiency of the deals made? Must we 
repress our knowledge that private contracts can be distorted by negative 
externalities, imbalances of power and knowledge, or that market value 
will not always align with social value?
My purpose is not to adjudicate among these competing ideas but 
to use the debate over corporate personhood as a crystal ball—­albeit a 
refracted and distorted one—­in which to see hints of the future of person­
ality for AI. So far, I see two.
First, in the corporation we have a working example of an artificial 
person, for better and worse. Historically, though, there has been con­
siderable disagreement about what that means and what it entails. We 
have disagreed about how best to characterize the corporation and then 
disagreed again on what a particular description implies, if anything, 
for the rights and duties given to the corporation. The same process is

CHAPTER 3
likely to characterize the debates over giving AI personality, even if that is 
done for reasons of efficiency rather than justice and empathy. We have 
hundreds of years of experience with corporations and still have funda­
mental disagreements about them. The creation of an entirely new class 
of legal person is likely to be even more fractious and subject to more 
radical alternative positions. How could we expect to have quick consen­
sus about legal personality for AI when we still cannot agree on what it 
should mean for corporations?
Second, one can imagine equivalents in the realm of Artificial Intel­
ligence to each of the theories I have just described. Take real entity the­
ory. There is a huge difference between an AI and a corporation. No one 
will ever think that Google and Bank of America are actually conscious 
beings. But Searle notwithstanding, some of us might believe exactly that 
if Hal ever turned from law professor's fantasy to reality. Unlike Google, 
Hal could claim to be a conscious being with the morally consequential 
qualities we see in ourselves. For that reason, it would argue, it is entitled 
to legal personality and equality regardless of whether that decision is 
efficient or not. For the believers, Hal is a real entity and, to be honest, 
their arguments move me more than those of Gierke and Maitland about 
the real personhood of a corporate entity. For the skeptics, even if they 
are willing to accept a legal status for AIs, it is purely out of economic 
and practical utility. Thus, for the skeptics, the legal fiction position—­
together with the scornful language about those who are reifying the 
word "person"—­is likely to be very attractive.
Others will feel that even this concession is going too far. The reaction 
to the draft EU report I described shows how viscerally people respond 
to the assertion of personhood. And the defense—­"that's not what we 
lawyers mean by legal person"—­though resonating exactly with the argu­
ments of Cohen and Dewey, will be unconvincing to those who think 
that personality claims always morph, sooner or later, into claims to more 
fundamental rights. Look at the distance between Story confidently con­
cluding that corporate personhood conveys no political rights and the 
Supreme Court according corporations extensive constitutional rights to 
speak and lobby. Finally, some people will look at Hal and see it as not a 
person at all but merely a reflection of the aggregate choices of its pro­
grammers. In that sense, they will be similar to Searle. If they accepted

legal personality for Hal, it would be as a way of summing up, or repre­
senting, the efforts of the engineers and programmers who created it. We 
might decide not to pierce the corporate veil to go after all the many, 
many programmers whose coding has created a faulty self-­driving AI. 
Instead, we might place that liability only on the AI, to be paid for out of 
"its" assets. But fundamentally we would see the AI as an aggregation and 
representation of a set of human choices.
Real entity, legal fiction, aggregation. It's the full suite. Corporation, 
meet AI. History does not repeat itself, but it often rhymes.20
There is an old joke about an abstruse philosopher hearing about 
an elaborate empirical study conducted by a more practical scholar, a 
study that included double-­blind testing, massive datasets, difference-­
in-­difference statistical analysis, the whole deal. The philosopher-­savant 
ponders and finally declares, "That may work well in practice, but it will 
never work in theory!" Does that division have explanatory power here? 
Regardless of the theoretical disagreements, how has corporate personal­
ity worked in practice, in the actual court decisions about what person­
hood means and what rights corporations have?
The answer is sobering. The process of working out the implications of 
corporate personhood, particularly in terms of the constitutional rights 
that personhood implies, has been about as far from the jurisprudential 
philosopher's clean room as can be imagined. Giving corporations legal 
personhood may be a great idea, functionally speaking. It solves coordi­
nation problems, offers stability over time, lowers transaction costs, and 
provides a framework for entrepreneurial risk-­taking without exposing 
the entrepreneur to ruinous liability if a single project does not work 
out. Innovation requires us to make bets and not all bets will pay off. But 
what further rights does that personhood choice imply? We have bum­
bled our way to an answer. The actual history of corporate personhood in 
the United States is marked by conclusory statements, question-­begging 
assumptions, and moments when mistake, ignorance, or arguable fraud 
played a role. It is also marked by the transformation, some would say 
hijacking, of the Fourteenth Amendment, and I will use that example as 
a case study.
The Fourteenth Amendment was written after the Civil War to ensure 
the equality of formerly enslaved humans who had been denied legal

personhood.21 Yet, for the first 50 years of its life, the Fourteenth Amend­
ment was co-­opted into protecting a very different group of persons, all 
without transparency, popular debate, or rigorous legal analysis. For the 
reasons laid out in the last two chapters, I think it is quite possible that, 
one day, a General-­Purpose AI will present our society with a morally con­
sequential and reasonably compelling case for personhood—­one based 
on consciousness but also on economic consequences. So count me as 
someone who could be sympathetic. Regardless of that feeling, I have to 
say the AI personhood debate needs to learn from the messy, conclusory, 
and occasionally corrupt history of corporate personality.
CORPORATIONS IN THE COURTS
On January 21, 2010, the Supreme Court of the United States handed 
down a decision in the case of Citizens United v. FEC. Citizens United is a 
nonprofit organization that challenged the constitutionality of portions 
of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, also known as McCain-­Feingold. 
The law prohibited labor unions and corporations from electioneering 
communications 60 days before an election. It also forbade them from 
spending money to advocate for the election or defeat of particular can­
didates at any time. Citizens United wished to distribute a film called 
Hillary: The Movie that was harshly critical of Hillary Clinton. In a 5-­4 
decision, the Supreme Court struck down the act's prohibition of inde­
pendent expenditures by corporations and unions. In the process, it 
paved the way for today's Super PACs, which allow wealthy donors to 
channel huge amounts of money into lobbying and campaigning. It also 
has led, indirectly, to a proliferation of "dark money" nonprofit groups 
that do not disclose donors at all.
You have probably heard of Citizens United. The decision has been exco­
riated by those who believe in campaign finance reform, including some 
conservatives. Senator John McCain called the decision "an outrage" and 
said that he "condemn[ed] the Supreme Court for their naivete."22 For 
liberals, it stands as a symbol of the failure to take seriously the fact that 
an inegalitarian distribution of wealth, coupled with permissive lobbying 
rules, can undermine the promise of government of the people, by the 
people, for the people. But Citizens United is probably best known in the

popular imagination as the case that gave corporations First Amendment 
rights equivalent to those possessed by human beings.
That framing is both right and wrong. On the one hand, as we will 
see, corporations have had expansive constitutional rights for at least 
150 years. The Supreme Court specifically affirmed the First Amendment 
rights of corporations in 1978, in the case of First National Bank of Boston 
v. Bellotti. There is, in fact, a nontrivial reason that we might believe that 
at least some corporate entities are rightfully in the core of First Amend­
ment protection. When the amendment says, "Congress shall make no 
law [. . .] abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press," it seems to con­
fer a right on at least one kind of association—­a newspaper, for example. 
We expect the New York Times, and not just the journalist who wrote the 
article, to be able to challenge governmental restraints on speech.
On the other hand, Citizens United did mark a sea change, both in law 
and in the popular imagination. The heart of the argument in favor of 
McCain-­Feingold-­style campaign finance reform was that, in significant 
respects, corporate "people" are different: they possess fewer of the attri­
butes that would justify expansive constitutional speech rights and more 
of the potentially dangerous characteristics that could justify state regula­
tion of their lobbying activities. It was the rejection of that distinct argu­
ment that most upset the dissent. Justice John Paul Stevens, for example, 
wrote,"[C]orporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no 
thoughts, no desires. Corporations help structure and facilitate the activi­
ties of human beings, to be sure, and their 'personhood' often serves as 
a useful legal fiction. But they are not themselves members of 'We the 
People' by whom and for whom our Constitution was established."23 Two 
hundred and fifty years earlier, Baron Thurlow, lord high chancellor of 
Great Britain, had put the point even more pithily: "Did you . . . expect a 
corporation to have a conscience, when it has no soul to be damned, and 
no body to be kicked?"24 A less quotable, but probably more accurate ver­
sion has him saying, "Corporations have neither bodies to be punished, 
nor souls to be condemned; they therefore do as they like."25
You might think this a uniquely liberal concern. But here is Justice 
William Rehnquist, one of the most consistently conservative Supreme 
Court Justices of the late twentieth century, dissenting in the 1978 case 
First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti:

CHAPTER 3
This Court decided at an early date, with neither argument nor discussion, that 
a business corporation is a "person" entitled to the protection of the Equal Pro­
tection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . Since it cannot be disputed 
that the mere creation of a corporation does not invest it with all the liberties 
enjoyed by natural persons, (corporations do not enjoy the privilege against 
self-­incrimination), our inquiry must seek to determine which constitutional 
protections are "incidental to its very existence." There can be little doubt that, 
when a State creates a corporation with the power to acquire and utilize prop­
erty, it necessarily and implicitly guarantees that the corporation will not be 
deprived of that property absent due process of law. Likewise, when a State 
charters a corporation for the purpose of publishing a newspaper, it necessar­
ily assumes that the corporation is entitled to the liberty of the press essential 
to the conduct of its business. . . . It cannot be so readily concluded that the 
right of political expression is equally necessary to carry out the functions of 
a corporation organized for commercial purposes. A State grants to a business 
corporation the blessings of potentially perpetual life and limited liability to 
enhance its efficiency as an economic entity. It might reasonably be concluded 
that those properties, so beneficial in the economic sphere, pose special dangers 
in the political sphere. Furthermore, it might be argued that liberties of political 
expression are not at all necessary to effectuate the purposes for which States 
permit commercial corporations to exist.  .  .  . Indeed, the States might reason­
ably fear that the corporation would use its economic power to obtain further benefits 
beyond those already bestowed.26
In short, like Story, Rehnquist would give corporations only those con­
stitutional rights necessary to fulfill their societally approved functional 
goals, while corporations' rights could be limited when their nature posed 
a threat to democracy. The majority strongly disagreed with this claim: 
"We thus find no support in the First or Fourteenth Amendment, or in 
the decisions of this Court, for the proposition that speech that otherwise 
would be within the protection of the First Amendment loses that pro­
tection simply because its source is a corporation that cannot prove, to 
the satisfaction of a court, a material effect on its business or property."27 
Justice Warren E. Burger, concurring, put the point even more tersely, 
"In short, the First Amendment does not 'belong' to any definable cat­
egory of persons or entities: It belongs to all who exercise its freedoms."28 
Read that phrase again: "all who exercise its freedoms." In this framing, 
General Motors has the same status as the Black Lives Matter or National 
Rifle Association protester—­part of the "all" who exercise the freedom 
of speech.

When debates begin over personhood for AI, and the rights any legal 
personhood will carry, the single most obvious analogy will be to corpo­
rate personhood and corporate constitutional rights. How did we come to 
decide, as a society, that corporations have the precise set of constitutional 
rights that they currently do? In the next section, I will use the history of 
the Supreme Court's decisions over equal protection for corporations as a 
case study. Look again at the first line I quoted from Rehnquist's dissent: 
"This Court decided at an early date, with neither argument nor discussion, 
that a business corporation is a 'person' entitled to the protection of the 
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." Neither argu­
ment nor discussion: that does not sound very impressive for such a hugely 
consequential decision. Yet the reality is even stranger and possibly more 
troubling.
CORPORATE CONSPIRACY OR CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLUENCE?
If the story of corporate personhood in the United States were a Victo­
rian melodrama, one vital chapter might be called "Roscoe Conkling 
and the Conclusory Court Reporter." 29 (That title probably shows why I 
would not write successful melodramas.) Still, the reality has legal drama 
aplenty. It is worth studying for our purposes because it shows just how 
sloppy and poorly reasoned our last process of decision-­making over con­
stitutional rights for artificial persons was. If anything, Rehnquist's "nei­
ther argument nor discussion" is a kind assessment.
Here's the short version. After the Civil War, the Thirteenth, Four­
teenth, and Fifteenth Amendments—­sometimes called the Civil War 
Amendments—changed the Constitution to end slavery and involuntary 
servitude forever and to erase the legal inequalities that had been suffered 
for so long by African Americans. For many legal scholars, including me, 
these are among the most majestic clauses in the Constitution. The Civil 
War killed more than 620,000 soldiers and caused death and suffering to 
countless civilians.30 This immense struggle was fought in order to end 
the nation's original sin, slavery, and to enshrine principles of equality 
and due process of law in the Constitution itself. The Civil War Amend­
ments give effect to that wish.

CHAPTER 3
Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment is short: "All persons born or 
naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, 
are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No 
State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or 
immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any 
person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny 
to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."31 
The architecture of the clause seems simple. "Persons" born in the United 
States have birthright citizenship. Thus the slaves who were formerly 
noncitizens became citizens. The government cannot make or enforce 
laws that abridge citizens' privileges or immunities, nor deprive any per­
son of life, liberty, or property without due process, nor deny them equal 
protection of the laws. Do you see any mention of corporations in that 
great clause?
In December of 1882, a lawyer stood before the Supreme Court to argue 
that corporations were persons protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. 
He had the wonderfully Dickensian name of Roscoe Conkling. When he 
claimed the drafters of the amendment had wanted to include corpo­
rations among the persons that the amendment protected, he had one 
impressive claim to authority. In 1866, he had been one of those draft­
ers. Conkling's argument was strengthened by his reference to a record 
of the drafters' work that was not then publicly available, but to which 
he referred extensively in court. He faced an uphill battle for three rea­
sons. First, with the war only 17 years in the rearview mirror, the goals of 
the Fourteenth Amendment were still fresh in people's minds. The Civil 
War had not been fought to emancipate corporations. Second, some of 
the references to persons in the Fourteenth Amendment being "born" or 
"naturalized" clearly referred to human beings and human beings alone. 
Third, in a decision construing the "privileges and immunities" portion 
of section 1 of the amendment shortly before Conkling's argument, the 
Supreme Court had announced that
[a]n examination of the history of the causes which led to the adoption of those 
amendments and of the amendments themselves demonstrates that the main 
purpose of all the three last amendments was the freedom of the African race, 
the security and perpetuation of that freedom, and their protection from the 
oppressions of the white men who had formerly held them in slavery. . . . In

giving construction to any of those articles, it is necessary to keep this main 
purpose steadily in view, though the letter and spirit of those articles must apply 
to all cases coming within their purview, whether the party concerned be of 
African descent or not.32
In other words, the amendment was adopted for an entirely different 
purpose. It used language in ways that, at least in some places, appeared 
to contradict the argument for corporate equal protection rights. It had 
been authoritatively construed by the Supreme Court to be primarily 
focused on ending the legal results of white supremacy. Yet Conkling 
would, nevertheless, argue that the Fourteenth Amendment protected 
corporations. That is a steep rhetorical hill to climb.
Historians describe Conkling as a superb orator, but you would not 
know that from the first stage of his argument before the Supreme Court, 
which began with a tedious recounting of the amendment's drafting pro­
cess. But then his thesis emerged. It had three parts, two of which are 
arguably inconsistent with each other.
First, the framers of the amendment had always meant to include cor­
porations in the term "persons" and specifically used that term rather 
than, say, "citizens," in order to make that clear.
Second, the framers may not have meant to include corporations in 
the amendment. Who can perfectly identify the views of a group made 
up of multiple people, making decisions over an extended period of 
time? However, and here he quotes one of Ralph Waldo Emerson's poems 
about the multiplicity of meaning in the works of humans, perhaps they 
"builded better than [they] knew."33 In other words, the framers had been 
thinking about undoing the legalized white supremacy that had subju­
gated African Americans, but by choosing the term "persons," which the 
law had used for centuries to include natural and legal persons, the result 
they achieved was greater than their immediate aim.
Third, it would be practically, morally, and legally untenable to restrict 
the Fourteenth Amendment to natural persons. Conkling conjured sev­
eral examples of African Americans joining together in some corporate 
entity and then being discriminated against on the grounds of race. Using 
a form of aggregation theory, he argued that if the discrimination against 
them individually had been illegal, discrimination against them as a group 
would surely have been illegal. Perhaps judging that the sympathies of

CHAPTER 3
the Supreme Court would be insufficiently moved by conjuring up hypo­
thetical associations of African Americans, he then flipped the hypo­
thetical and imagined the same legal discrimination being visited on an 
association of white Americans, for racial reasons.
Notice the cleverness of this argument. Conkling set himself up so 
that the Supreme Court could rule for him on the grounds of original 
intent (i.e., the framers meant to protect corporations), plain meaning 
of the text (i.e., they actually didn't, but "persons" means "all persons," 
even if they did not realize that), association (i.e., a corporation is an 
association of persons, and if they have rights, so does the corporation), 
and consequentialism, subtly connecting the protection of corporations 
to a theme of fighting racial discrimination even though the corpora­
tion he represented was subject to no such discrimination. His own client 
claimed that corporate mortgages must be treated the same as human 
beings' mortgages for tax purposes—­not a topic given much space in the 
Gettysburg Address.
Understandably, it was the explosive first argument that attracted his­
torians' attention and, in turn, led me to discuss his claims. Was Conkling 
exposing a conspiracy? Had the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment 
used the plight of enslaved African Americans as the stalking horse to 
sneak in constitutional protections for corporations, protections that one 
of the framers was now trying to cash in on in front of the Supreme Court 
years later? Charles A. Beard, author of An Economic Interpretation of the 
Constitution, is often credited with the idea of a general conspiracy to cap­
ture the movement for racial justice and to subvert it to protect corpora­
tions. Beard did cite Conkling's argument as proof of the goals of some of 
the drafters, but his assessment was actually more subtle:
So in the economy of history it came about that rights accorded to natural 
and mortal persons were extended to artificial and immortal persons and, 
under judicial supremacy, protected against Congress, state constitutional 
conventions, state legislatures, city councils, and other governmental agencies 
of unfeathered bipeds, called men and women. In the case of the Fourteenth 
Amendment this extension of rights to corporations was certainly not generally 
intended by promoters and ratifiers. In the case of the Fourteenth Amendment 
it was specifically intended by some promoters, and not generally understood 
by the ratifiers. Such at least seem in high degrees to be the probabilities.34

151
Was the first part of Conkling's argument—­that the framers had 
intended to protect corporations by the amendment—­actually correct? 
Was it honest? Howard Graham, who produced the definitive study of 
the framing of the amendment, answered both questions in the negative:
Conkling's elaborate brief and argument of 1882 actually were built upon and 
around a daring misuse of the Joint Committee's Journal—­that document of 
1866 which he had produced and employed with such dramatic effect before 
the Court. This misuse was primarily a misquotation—­the substitution by Con­
kling as he read from the Journal to the Court in 1882, of "citizen" for "person" 
in the text of one of the primitive drafts of what afterward became the due 
process and equal protection clauses of 1866. Listeners thus naturally gained 
the impression, strengthened by other portions of Conkling's argument, that 
later on, during the Joint Committee's labors in 1866, the word "person" had 
been re-­instated [because of a deliberate decision by the framers to extend rights 
beyond citizens to corporations]. Offhand, of course, Conkling's innuendo sup­
plied a plausible reason. Yet here was the very official manuscript text from 
which Conkling purportedly had quoted; it revealed that "person" always had 
been employed in the Committee's drafts—­the main reason clearly being that 
the wordings had been taken from the phraseology of the fifth amendment. 
Some of Conkling's minor propositions also were dubious, but this one point 
was crucial, and it cast grave doubt on his entire thesis. For it was past under­
standing that an advocate with a clear, strong case ever would prejudice it by 
this brazen historical forgery.35
Did this "brazen historical forgery" carry the day? Ironically, because of 
procedural technicalities, the Supreme Court did not rule on Conkling's 
case. But a later case, Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad from 
1886, seemed to give corporations the protections they desired, counting 
them as persons for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Why do I say "seemed"? If you read the decision, the answer looks 
clear, even if you disagree with the outcome. Supreme Court opinions 
commonly begin with a "Syllabus" or headnote, a summary prepared 
by the court reporter that does not have the force of law but has been 
unwisely used by generations of law students to avoid reading the actual 
case. The Santa Clara headnote maintains:
One of the points made and discussed at length in the brief of counsel for defen­
dants in error was that "corporations are persons within the meaning of the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States." Before argu­
ment, Mr. Chief Justice Waite said: "The Court does not wish to hear argument

CHAPTER 3
on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the 
Constitution which forbids a state to deny to any person within its jurisdiction 
the equal protection of the laws applies to these corporations. We are all of 
opinion that it does."36
The difficulty with this claim is that the decision says no such thing. That 
note was inserted by the court reporter, J. Bancroft Davis. The Court's 
actual decision, though, the only part of the document that has any legal 
force, does not rely on the claim that corporate personhood is being pro­
tected by the Fourteenth Amendment. It is silent on the issue. Yet, due to 
that headnote, the decision is one of the most widely cited in the history 
of constitutional corporate law. Did corporations get equal protection 
rights because of an error or, worse, a deliberate falsification by a reporter 
whose statements should have received no legal force? Some have made 
much of the fact that Davis himself was the former president of the New­
burgh and New York Railroad.37
Davis wrote to Chief Justice Waite asking him if his headnote was 
correct: "Dear Chief Justice, I have a memorandum in the California 
Cases Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific &c As follows. In opening 
the Court stated that it did not wish to hear argument on the question 
whether the Fourteenth Amendment applies to such corporations as are 
parties in these suits. All the Judges were of the opinion that it does." 
Waite's response was short: "I think your mem. in the California Rail­
road Tax cases expresses with sufficient accuracy what was said before 
the argument began. I leave it with you to determine whether anything 
need be said about it in the report inasmuch as we avoided meeting the 
constitutional question in the decision."38 Some histories of this event 
quote only the second sentence of Waite's response, making Davis's over­
reach seem even more damning.39 But even if Waite had acknowledged 
that "all the judges were of the opinion" that the Fourteenth Amendment 
applied to corporations, that was not what they had actually decided. 
Indeed, the Supreme Court had not even heard argument on the issue. 
Yet subsequent courts would cite Santa Clara as the definitive ruling. Over 
time those precedents would accumulate, each dutifully citing the case as 
binding authority. Rehnquist, it seems, was being generous. He said this 
massively consequential decision was made "with neither argument nor 
discussion." In fact, it was never made at all.

153
For a decision that was never made, it had a huge effect, as Adam Win­
kler points out:
[I]n 1912, Charles Wallace Collins, a lawyer who also served for a time as the 
law librarian for Congress and the Supreme Court, collected and analyzed every 
Fourteenth Amendment case decided by the justices in the nearly half-­century 
since the provision's unorthodox ratification. The court, he found, had heard 
604 Fourteenth Amendment cases between 1868 and 1912. A mere twenty-­
eight of those cases (less than 5 percent) involved African Americans, the group 
whose plight motivated the adoption of the amendment, and in nearly all 
of those cases the racial minorities lost. More than half of all the Fourteenth 
Amendment cases decided by the Supreme Court—­312 in total—­involved cor­
porations, which succeeded in striking down numerous laws regulating busi­
ness, including minimum wage laws, zoning laws, and child labor laws.40
These are truly remarkable numbers. The majority of the equal protection 
cases between 1868 and 1912 were brought by corporations. A tiny per­
centage of the cases were brought by African Americans. An amendment 
passed to remedy legalized racial discrimination against humans denied 
legal personhood had become a tool for corporations to fight state regula­
tion. Collins, the author of this early empirical study, had very different 
views on this shocking statistic than we do today. Reading chapter 5 of 
his book, one finds that
[t]he presence of a large number of persons of African descent within our 
bounds—­different in origin, temperament, and physical appearance from the 
Teutonic stock among whom they dwell—­has ever been a serious problem in 
the life of our republic. The organic law of the land has more than once felt the 
effect of this situation, a situation abnormal in a high degree. The influence of 
the negro on our constitutional development, though in a large measure nega­
tive, has been none the less potent.41
Though Collins appears to have been a racist to the core, making his 
conclusions all the more striking, his study encapsulates in hard num­
bers something that any lawyer at the turn of the twentieth century 
could have told you. Corporations were then the principal beneficiary 
of equal protection jurisprudence. From the writing of the amendment 
to Conkling's misleading claims about the goals of its drafters, to Davis's 
headnote, to the cases that subsequently cited Santa Clara as precedent, a 
constitutional revolution had occurred. Artificial persons had moved to 
the core of equal protection.

CHAPTER 3
These facts raise some obvious questions. Is our entire jurisprudence 
of equal protection for corporations the fruit of a poisonous tree and 
therefore worthless? Should we see the Fourteenth Amendment rights 
of corporations as being built on the "brazen historical forgery" of a per­
suasive argument about the intent of the framers? Even if that argument 
did not result in an actual court ruling? Should we see it as resting on the 
overreaching actions of a court reporter with no legal authority whose 
statements were echoed improperly by subsequent courts down to the 
present day? Some histories of the growth of corporate rights put great 
weight on both.42 My reaction is more complicated.
First, let us acknowledge the power of the critique revealed by our 
history. The decision to give corporations rights under the Fourteenth 
Amendment was a hugely consequential one. Regardless of one's views 
on the merits, it deserved careful legal analysis and reasoned decision-­
making. To have that decision made with "neither argument nor discus­
sion" was a major failure of the legal process. To have it rest on a court 
reporter's account of a discussion before oral argument was a travesty. The 
history of our legal system's decision over the equal protection rights of 
corporations invites neither confidence nor respect. Beyond the flawed 
process is a disturbing political and legal result. A protection created for 
one set of natural persons was hijacked for the benefit of an entirely dif­
ferent group of artificial ones and the reasoning for doing so was at best 
sloppy and at worst tainted. When analogies are made between corpora­
tions and Artificial Intelligences, I would expect both of those points to 
be made with great force, and appropriately so.
This point is one of the central takeaways from this chapter. One 
might have imagined that liberals would be the most ardent defenders of 
personhood for our new silicon brothers and sisters. After all, are they not 
eager to add another station on the Kantian railway line of rights extend­
ing to ever larger groups—­first white men, then all men, then women, 
and so on? But if liberals view the decision over AI rights through the 
lens of the history of corporate personhood—­from Santa Clara to Citi­
zens United—­then they might be its keenest foes. Once again, is an arti­
ficial entity going to hijack a set of rights designed for persons of a very 
different kind? One could imagine the slogans: "Human Rights Are for

Humans!" The outrage following the draft EU report starts to come into 
better focus. Score one for the historical perspective.
Yet the history has real limits that critics do not always explain. Though 
parts of this story are delicious, and one can see why historians have been 
fascinated, those limits need to be acknowledged. Conkling's argument 
about original intent is important for those seeking to understand the 
aims of the original drafters of the amendment, or for those trying to 
discern if there was a conspiracy to use racial justice as a veil behind 
which constitutional corporate protections were expanded. It may be 
considerably less important in terms of the actual decisions of the courts 
and the development of the law. Perhaps the Supreme Court was moved 
by Conkling's claims, some of which seem exaggerated, if not a "brazen 
historical forgery." And perhaps they were not impressed. We simply do 
not know. After all, the Court rendered no decision in that case. What's 
more, Conkling's arguments had multiple parts and original intent was 
only one. Even if the Supreme Court were to have been persuaded by his 
argument, and that influenced its future deliberations, it could have been 
the appeals to plain meaning, the idea of associational rights, or the con­
sequences of ruling otherwise that moved the needle.
As for Davis's influence, we now have 135 years of precedent accreted 
in sedimentary layers around that initial flawed process. ("Like a pearl 
built up around a grain of sand," the enthusiast for corporate rights might 
say.) Surely courts would not have gone on citing that flawed headnote 
if they were not already leaning toward believing its major premise. Reli­
ance on precedent, on stare decisis, is a legal value as well. Courts can and 
do sometimes overturn decades of precedent, but merely demonstrating 
problems in the original decision is not normally enough. The Supreme 
Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, perhaps throwing many other 
constitutional rights into doubt, puts the obvious asterisk after this state­
ment. However, this Court is far more solicitous of the rights of corpora­
tions than of reproductive control or gay marriage. Precedents supporting 
corporations are probably safe, regardless of how bad their historical cre­
dentials are and how weak the claim that they reflect the original public 
meaning of the Constitution. In any event, even if the initial decision 
were flawed, goes this argument, eventually one has to give up the story

CHAPTER 3
of an original sin that caused us to be cast out from Fourteenth Amend­
ment Eden and focus on our current plight. "Get over it," as Justice Anto­
nin Scalia is reported to have said about the Supreme Court's shameful 
Bush v. Gore decision.43 This way of looking at things does not entirely 
convince me. The absence of a thought-­out, properly argued, authori­
tatively decided basis for corporate constitutional rights is surely some­
thing we should be concerned about. But the pushback offers valuable 
insights about the limits of the historical view.
Finally, the focus on a "personalistic" narrative in which major choices 
in political and legal history are determined by the actions of a few indi­
viduals may underestimate the importance of the economic and ideologi­
cal milieu in which the decision takes place. Conkling's critics are fond 
of quoting Graham's conclusion that part of his argument was a "bra­
zen historical forgery." Less frequently cited are Graham's own conclu­
sions about the reasons for protecting corporations under the Fourteenth 
Amendment:
After considering the matter for two years, the writer's personal conclusion is 
that as long as all major conditions are fulfilled, Conkling perhaps ought to 
be given benefit of the doubt, even though few courts would be inclined to 
accept him as a disinterested or even honorable witness. . . . From a study of the 
evolution of the phraseology in the Joint Committee the writer feels confident 
that Section One was not designed to aid corporations, nor was the distinction 
between "citizens" and "persons" conceived for their benefit. But the outstand­
ing conclusion warranted by the present evidence is concerned with the irrel­
evancy rather than with the character of the Joint Committee's intentions. It 
is now plain that corporate personality, as a constitutional doctrine, antedated 
the Fourteenth Amendment, and was in fact so vital and natural a part of the 
self-­expansion of judicial power within the framework of due process, that its 
postwar development was assured, whatever may have been the original objec­
tives of the framers. . . . Having simultaneously fostered the growth of corporate 
enterprise as well as a mighty upsurge of popular idealism, the Civil War of 
itself consummated a marriage of idealistic and economic elements in American 
constitutional theory. In the words of Max Ascoli, the Fourteenth Amendment 
was the "supreme celebration" of this union. It would appear largely immaterial 
whether those who presided at the rites were conscious of their function.44
I am less convinced than Graham of the inevitability of a decision 
like Santa Clara, even if it could have been better reasoned, or actually 
reasoned at all. A great lesson of historical and comparative studies is

that scholars tend to believe that particular results are deterministically 
required, so that X economic or technological development inevitably 
produces Y result. Yet if one looks at a different time or place, one sees 
significant variation in consequences. One can believe it useful to grant 
corporations legal personhood and even believe that some constitutional 
rights are logically entailed by that choice. One can acknowledge the 
larger social forces he describes. Even with all of those qualifications, 
one can disagree with the reach of corporate constitutional rights and 
see the expansive political rights granted to corporations under current 
law as a historically contingent error that can, and perhaps should, be 
changed. Still, Graham is surely right that the forces that helped produce 
the law we have now, from overt lobbying to implicit ideologies to eco­
nomic worldview, are larger than the intentions of particular individuals 
or groups.
***
Where does all of this leave us now, in the era of Citizens United, on the 
question of equal protection rights for corporations? Set aside the check­
ered history. What is the right answer? Even leaving the history out of it, 
the case for corporate equal protection rights is surprisingly shaky. From 
my point of view there is, at best, equipoise between strong arguments 
on both sides. One can make a persuasive legal argument, using almost 
any school or tradition of constitutional thought, that the application 
of the Fourteenth Amendment to corporations is a grievous error or an 
inevitable and benign truth. Let us start with the negative case.
If one is a constitutional originalist, there are strong arguments that 
those who framed and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment neither 
intended nor understood it to extend to corporations.
If one believes in focusing on the "plain meaning" of language, it is 
hard to explain how the word "person" used earlier in section 1 to describe 
those who are "born" or "naturalized"—­clearly not corporations—­only a 
few sentences later somehow includes corporations.
If one focuses on the pragmatic consequences of a decision, one might 
agree with that notorious radical, Rehnquist, that "the States might rea­
sonably fear that the corporation would use its economic power to obtain

further benefits beyond those already bestowed" and thus believe that 
limitations on the corporation's rights were not only wise but faithful to 
the constitutional structure.45
If one believes in an evolving constitution, in which the great clauses 
are "left to gather meaning from experience,"46 one might think that the 
corporations of today are vastly more powerful than the individual citi­
zens around them and that they have unwisely been granted not equal 
protection but greater protection. Indeed, two influential Justices, William 
O. Douglas and Hugo Black, advanced versions of each of these argu­
ments in dissent in a 1949 case called Wheeling Steel v. Glander.47
The opposition to the expansive view of constitutional rights for cor­
porations has not only been a historically consistent theme, but it has 
also included judges and scholars from across the political spectrum. 
Rehnquist, Douglas, and Black join Stevens. Earlier, I quoted Stevens's 
dissent in Citizens United. True, he was dealing with a different constitu­
tional right, but the application to equal protection seems clear: If cor­
porations are "not members of 'We the People' by whom and for whom 
our Constitution was established,"48 then why are we saying their legal 
protections must, necessarily, be equal to those granted to actual people?
These points are not dispositive, of course. Strong counterarguments 
can be provided to each. True, Conkling's arguments about an original 
intent to protect corporations seem weak at best and fraudulent at worst. 
That does not seem to have been their intent. But the framers and rati­
fiers of the Fourteenth Amendment were also not thinking about equal 
protection against discrimination based on sex, gender, or sexual orienta­
tion. Yet today the amendment is understood to reach those classifica­
tions at least sometimes, as of the time of writing. (Who knows what 
tomorrow will bring?) Indeed, this is one reason why constitutional origi­
nalism seems unpersuasive to many.49 For example, in Obergefell v. Hodges, 
which recognized the right to gay marriage, the Supreme Court noted 
"new insights and societal understandings"50 about inequality foisted 
on gays and lesbians in describing the synergy between due process and 
equal protection. It seems unlikely that those who wish to use originalist 
arguments to constrain the power of corporations would agree to accept 
originalist understandings of the amendment for categories such as sex 
and sexual orientation.51

One could argue that the plain meaning of "person" does reach cor­
porations unless otherwise indicated, as is done in the references to birth 
or naturalization but not elsewhere in the amendment. The argument 
would be that, where there is no express limitation, we should construe 
"person" as broadly as possible.
If one adopts Rehnquist's or Stevens's view and limits the constitu­
tional rights of corporations to those that are logically implied by their 
chartered function, then one could argue that at least the due process 
protections of the Fourteenth Amendment fit within that category. Do 
corporations not have a need for due process protections for their prop­
erty? Why not equal protection then?
As for evolving constitutionalism, the changing role of corporations 
could be seen as increasing their claims to a right of equal protection. 
The percentage of citizens who are indirect holders of corporate shares, 
at least through their pension funds or IRAs, has increased. One could 
take an aggregate view of corporate personality in which equal protection 
rights were justified to help safeguard the interests of those citizens. And 
so on and on.
Corporate persons are a familiar and uncontroversial part of our world. 
Yet, surprisingly, when one pushes a bit on what corporate personhood 
means, one finds the ground is far from firm.
***
The Citizens United decision was presented by its critics as something 
new, as an awful and unprecedented expansion of rights to entities never 
thought to be "members of 'We the People' by whom and for whom 
our Constitution was established."52 It may be a poorly reasoned deci­
sion with consequences that are harmful to the republic and, ironically, 
to the speech rights of actual humans. Personally, I think it is. But new? 
Not really. Citizens United is just another step, albeit a large one, in a 135-­
year journey in which the same arguments and the same expressions of 
outrage have emerged again and again.

ligences should be given legal personality, and the question of what 
that personality will mean in terms of fundamental rights, we will turn

inevitably to both the theory and the law of corporate personhood and 
corporate fundamental rights. We will probably do so in the confident 
expectation that here at least is something society has actually figured 
out. Surely we have a good handle philosophically on what we mean 
by corporate personality. Surely we have a well-­thought-­out, consistent, 
consensus-­inspiring set of legal conclusions about which fundamental 
rights personality entails? In both cases, as I hope this chapter has shown, 
the answer is, at best, that we are still debating the issue. Confident 
extrapolation is hardly in order despite our hundreds of years of experi­
ence with corporate personality.
Beyond the intellectual superstructure, the political reality of corpo­
rate personality will surely influence debates over AI. The first chapter 
presented one possible path toward personality for AI, the line grounded 
in empathy and the moral necessities that come from recognizing a fel­
low "person." There, the questions were, "How will society do when it 
is faced by its own Voight-­Kampff Test? Will it be able to look beyond 
the skin, the carapace, the metal, and see the fraternity of conscious­
ness beneath?" That path has its parallels, from Uncle Tom's Cabin and 
the abolitionist movement to Blade Runner and Do Androids Dream of Elec­
tric Sheep?
This chapter has offered a different path, one grounded in efficiency 
and administrative convenience, in the legal fictions, real entities, and 
contract nexi of the world. Those forces are strong and, in many cases, 
benign. Yet they also come with their own history. The sympathetic lib­
eral eager to respond positively to Hal's question "Am I not a man and 
a brother?" may find herself given pause by the implications of creating 
yet another set of powerful artificial entities that might be suspected of 
hijacking rights created for a very different "we, the people." When she 
turns to the theory and history of corporate personality, she will not be 
reassured.
I began this book because I thought that trying to understand whether 
new, technologically created, artificial entities should be seen as part of 
the "we, the people" who deserve legal equality and respect would force 
us to take a hard look back at ourselves. As I said earlier, grappling with 
the question of synthetic Others may bring about a reexamination of the 
nature of human identity and consciousness. I want to stress the potential

magnitude of that reexamination. This process may offer challenges to 
our self-­conception unparalleled since secular philosophers declared that 
we would have to learn to live with a God-­shaped hole at the center of 
our world. Those challenges may be good for us. I have argued that to 
draw the line for our creations, we must first redraw it for ourselves. We 
have to take a hard look at the current places where we draw the line, at 
the legitimacy of our distinctions and the force of our reasoning.
Yet those insights, those feelings that perhaps we need to think more 
deeply, to go beyond our reasoning about what makes someone human, 
reach beyond the species line. They also extend to the debate about what 
makes something a legal person, and what rights that legal person should 
have. Perhaps that is the most important conclusion I want the reader to 
take away from this chapter. In the case of corporate personality, we have 
a good reason to want corporations to be able to make contracts, sue, and 
so forth. We even have good reasons to believe that some of the consti­
tutional rights to which humans are entitled are entailed by that choice: 
due process protections over corporate assets, say, or freedom of the press 
for a newspaper company. Yet when one turns to the larger questions 
about the full suite of constitutional rights to which corporations should 
be entitled, one finds that we have neither a convincing history nor a 
convincing moral or legal theory that justifies where we have ended up. 
That fact should offer considerable humility when we turn to the same 
question for AIs. It might also convince us that the decisions we have 
made so far about corporate persons are neither inevitable nor dictated by 
precedent or logic. It might lead us, in fact, to rethink them.

NONHUMAN ANIMALS
On December 2, 2013, Tommy's lawyers filed a suit in New York Supreme 
Court in Fulton County, New York. They alleged a shocking pattern of 
abuse and deprivation by private parties who, they claimed, were holding 
their client captive in a concrete cell. Seeking Tommy's liberty, they used 
the time-­honored claim of the unjustly confined, a writ of common law 
habeas corpus. These are serious allegations. But that was not why the 
case attracted attention. Tommy is a chimpanzee.1
The claim was brought by the Nonhuman Rights Project, founded by 
Steven Wise. The project has an audacious mission statement. The first 
goal is "[t]o change the common law status of great apes, elephants, dol­
phins, and whales from mere 'things,' which lack the capacity to possess 
any legal right, to 'legal persons,' who possess such fundamental rights 
as bodily liberty and bodily integrity."2 Wise is a lecturer at Harvard Law 
School and a litigator. His focus is on nonhuman animals rather than AI 
and transgenic species, but his interests are very much mine. Wise even 
used a similar title for one of his books, Drawing the Line: Science and the 
Case for Animal Rights. In fact, the campaigns waged by Wise and the 
Nonhuman Rights Project, and other similar efforts around the world, 
provide a precisely analogous case study for the questions I am trying 
to answer. How does, how should, a culture debate the line of person­
hood? How does one mobilize arguments from empathy, science, law, 
and moral philosophy to change our perceptions of our nonhuman ani­
mal neighbors—­to see them as legal persons, not things? This is a cam­
paign fought in courtrooms and opinion pages, in legal technicality and 
precedent, but also in the scientific analysis of cognition. It uses argu­
ments grounded in moral philosophy but also in empathetic attempts to

CHAPTER 4
humanize, to personify, nonhuman animals. In my view and in the view 
of other researchers such as Kate Darling,3 it is a fight that presages the 
coming debates we will face over AI and transgenic species, hybrids, and 
chimeras. Sometimes those parallels are surprising.
So far, I have discussed Artificial General Intelligence—­synthetic, 
perhaps digital, entities—­and the factors that might influence or shape 
personhood claims made by them or on behalf of them. I have pointed 
out two main possible approaches. The first oscillates between empathy 
and a process of moral analysis, between the sympathetic flash of insight 
that connects the self with the Other and the philosophical inquiry into 
whether a particular entity has the characteristics that we believe entitle 
it to recognition as a person. The most obvious of these characteristics is 
consciousness, though moral philosophers have produced considerably 
longer lists involving qualities such as a sense of morality or a distinct 
identity that, even if it changes, is recognizably connected to its prior 
incarnations through time.4 One could add others, such as the ability to 
imaginatively project oneself into the future or a recognition of moral 
rights and duties beyond one's immediate kinship circle. The general 
form of the argument is this: the attributes that give us, those inside the 
line, a compelling moral claim to personhood are X, Y, and Z, but Hal 
also possesses X, Y, and Z; therefore, I am logically and ethically bound to 
recognize Hal as a person.
The second approach, explored in the context of corporations, is based 
on efficiency, on social goals unrelated to empathy. Arguably, it also lacks 
a deontological component, a basis in moral duty.5 Its roots are in conve­
nience, not moral right.6 The personality that has been granted to corpo­
rations is an endowment of certain rights and duties as a consequence of 
their desirable practical results rather than a recognition of some preex­
isting persona. In fact, in many conceptions of corporate personhood, it 
is the package of rights, duties, and powers—­together with the constitu­
tional protections those were thought to imply—­that literally constitutes 
corporate personhood.
Which approach would you take if you were Tommy's lawyer? Would 
you list those qualities that are commonly thought to entitle humans to 
our unique legal status—­consciousness, communication through signs,

165
or a moral sense—­and seek to prove that nonhuman animals also have 
those qualities? Most people assume that is where the battle will be fought 
since it would help mobilize both our empathy (e.g., "I never realized 
how like us they were!") and the syllogisms of our moral philosophy (e.g., 
"You believe that humans are persons because they have the qualities 
X and Y, but so do nonhuman animals!") Or would you argue, intersti­
tially and from within the legal system, either that there would be practi­
cal advantages to recognizing animals as persons or that the package of 
rights and duties that animals currently possess already implies their legal 
personhood?
The Nonhuman Rights Project, and other groups seeking to have 
animals declared legal persons, have taken both approaches. They have 
argued that at least some nonhuman animals (the higher primates, for 
example, and the cetaceans) have the qualities of mind that require the 
law to treat them as persons. But they have also argued that even if the law 
does not treat them as full persons, it does already treat them as entities 
who at least have rights, not as mere things lacking even the standing to 
raise a claim: "The question before this Court is not whether Tommy is a 
human being—­he is not—­but whether, like a human being, he is a 'legal 
person' under the law of New York. 'Legal person' has never been a syn­
onym for 'human being.' It designates Western law's most fundamental 
category by identifying those entities capable of possessing a legal right."7 
By identifying those existing rights, in other words, the goal is to say that 
nonhuman animals are already rightsholders and from that to imply per­
sonhood. Remember Felix Cohen, giving a legal realist account of what 
corporate personality means: "The realist will say, 'A labor union is a per­
son or quasi-­corporation because it can be sued; to call something a person 
in law, is merely to state, in metaphorical language, that it can be sued.'"8 
Effectively, Wise and his colleagues are turning Cohen's argument on its 
head. If an animal can sue, or at least hold rights, it must be a person.
In this chapter, I will explore both of these approaches, which I will 
call the qualities-­of-­mind argument and the legal-­rightsholders argu­
ment. My claim is that these debates are both extremely important in 
their own right and a fascinating, sometimes surprising preview of what 
our debates about AI and transgenic species will be.9

CHAPTER 4
THE QUALITIES-­OF-­MIND ARGUMENT
Do (some) nonhuman animals have qualities of mind that entitle them to 
legal personhood? This question is often conflated with the issue of ani­
mal ethics, but, while it is related, it is analytically distinct. For example, 
one could believe that human consciousness and intelligence are vastly 
different from those of nonhuman animals and that this is a ground for 
recognizing humans and only humans as "persons." Yet at the same time, 
one might think that the simple fact of our common ability to feel pain 
requires a much more protective set of rules and mores for how to treat 
our nonhuman cousins than those we currently have. Jeremy Bentham's 
famous line sums the point up nicely: "The question is not, Can they rea­
son? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"10
Thus, a strong commitment to animal rights, or to a utilitarian animal 
ethics, does not require a particular position on the defensibility of a 
qualitative distinction between us and the rest of the animal kingdom. 
Believers in the former are much, much more likely to be skeptics about 
the latter, but nothing in the logic requires them to be.
So let us turn to the question that has fascinated philosophers for cen­
turies. Nonhuman animals eat, sleep, procreate, feel pain, and die. What, 
if anything, justifies the stark moral distinctions that we draw between 
the human and nonhuman animal world, distinctions that form at least 
one basis for our personhood exceptionalism? After all, humans are quite 
obviously another form of animal. For Aristotle, the difference is both 
obvious and morally and politically consequential:
Now, that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other gregari­
ous animals is evident. Nature, as we often say, makes nothing in vain, and 
man is the only animal whom she has endowed with the gift of speech. And 
whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure or pain, and is therefore 
found in other animals (for their nature attains to the perception of pleasure 
and pain and the intimation of them to one another, and no further), the power 
of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and inexpedient, and therefore 
likewise the just and the unjust. And it is a characteristic of man that he alone 
has any sense of good and evil, of just and unjust, and the like, and the associa­
tion of living beings who have this sense makes a family and a state.11
Look how quickly Aristotle moves from an allegedly differentiating spe­
cies characteristic—­language—­to the qualities he thinks grow from that

167
language. Language, he claims, allows reasoning about expediency: how 
best to achieve our goals? But it also enables reasoning about justice, 
namely, which goals are right and just? This is why only the human 
species has morality. From that capacity for morality flows the partic­
ular type of associations so important to Greek philosophers: the fam­
ily and the polis. Here he is not just speaking about the surface of such 
arrangements—­there might be a family of dogs or a hierarchical power-­
structure in a wolf pack—­but the specific, reasoned, ethically laden asso­
ciations created by the web of thought he claims only human beings 
possess. There is a certain neatness to the argument. Aristotle's justifica­
tion for the line between human and animal rests on the very process of 
moral reasoning that it itself represents.
In the introduction to this book I described complex abstract language 
as the last citadel for human exceptionalism. Aristotle makes an effort to 
justify that exceptionalism and to link language to other qualities—­reason, 
law, community, humans as social animals subject to moral norms—­that 
powerfully resonate with the reasons we believe our species to be qualita­
tively different from nonhuman animals. As I will explain, that differen­
tiation has been shaken by ethological research into the complexities of 
animal behavior, shaken but not yet completely undermined. Does Aris­
totle's citadel fall not to animals with some language skills (chimpanzees 
that have some proficiency in American Sign Language, for example) but 
to the humble chatbot? Does ChatGPT show that complex abstract lan­
guage is not in fact our sole preserve? I think Aristotle's answer would be 
no. Chatbots may be capable of convincingly imitating human language. 
Yet the qualities that emerge from that language, the qualities that Aristo­
tle thought elevated man above beast—­reason, ethics, law, and political 
community, nomos, ethos, logos, and polis—­are not brought into being 
by word-­frequency distribution tables and neural networks doing back-­
propagation to generate the next word in a sentence. The citadel shakily 
stands, though its foundations might need some work.
In contrast to Aristotle's reason-­based justification for the moral sta­
tus of humans, we think of religion as rooting humanity's superiority 
in divine command and in a unique theological status for humanity. 
The Christian Bible, for example, says that our species has been given 
"dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and

168	
CHAPTER 4
over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every 
creeping thing that creeps upon the earth."12
Yet that dominion is not simply imposed by divine fiat; at least in 
some religions it stems from the assumption that, alone out of the animal 
kingdom, humans have the ability to make moral choices. Ideas similar 
to Aristotle's about reason enabling morality are thus connected to the 
concept of the soul. It is because we are assumed to be the only moral 
creatures that we can be saved or damned, can seek forgiveness for our 
sins, or can choose to turn away from the path of righteousness and suffer 
perdition as a consequence. Of course, the idea that only human beings 
have souls is far from universal. Think of Buddhism.13 But in some reli­
gious traditions, cognitive capacity is linked to divinely granted free will 
and thus to a special status for the human species, as opposed to the brute 
beasts who have no such free will, no such ability to make moral choices, 
no such soul. Again, claims are being made about something special in 
our consciousness. The line between humans and nonhuman animals 
thus takes on a theological significance. Our religious, not just our legal, 
status is at stake.
Given this background, one can imagine the cognitive dissonance pro­
duced by the introduction of the theory of evolution. Earlier I mentioned 
Bishop Wilberforce's alleged question to T. H. Huxley, namely whether "it 
was through his grandfather or his grandmother that he claimed descent 
from a monkey"?14 Part of Wilberforce's ridicule is leveled against the 
actual process of evolutionary biology. How—­biologically, physically—­
could something like a monkey evolve into a human? To the Victorian 
mind, it did not compute. But the other part of Wilberforce's objection 
is that the theory of evolution seems to blur the lines between sovereign 
humans and brute beasts. If we had in fact evolved from nonhuman ani­
mals, how could we claim the sharp, qualitative, and theological distinc­
tion from them that Wilberforce's version of religion assumed?
Charles Darwin was fully aware of this resistance and in his 1871 book, 
The Descent of Man, he attempted to confront it. He begins, somewhat 
reassuringly, by stressing that there are large differences between the con­
sciousness of human and nonhuman animals:
There can be no doubt that the difference between the mind of the lowest man 
and that of the highest animal is immense. An anthropomorphous ape, if he

could take a dispassionate view of his own case, would admit that though he 
could form an artful plan to plunder a garden—­though he could use stones for 
fighting or for breaking open nuts, yet that the thought of fashioning a stone 
into a tool was quite beyond his scope. Still less, as he would admit, could he 
follow out a train of metaphysical reasoning, or solve a mathematical problem, 
or reflect on God, or admire a grand natural scene. Some apes, however, would 
probably declare that they could and did admire the beauty of the coloured 
skin and fur of their partners in marriage. They would admit, that though they 
could make other apes understand by cries some of their perceptions and sim­
pler wants, the notion of expressing definite ideas by definite sounds had never 
crossed their minds. They might insist that they were ready to aid their fellow-­
apes of the same troop in many ways, to risk their lives for them, and to take 
charge of their orphans; but they would be forced to acknowledge that disin­
terested love for all living creatures, the most noble attribute of man, was quite 
beyond their comprehension.15
Contemporary scientists challenge some of these claims about ape 
behavior, pointing out examples of chimpanzees who seem to express 
wonder at waterfalls or keep complex toolkits that are passed down in 
distinct cultural patterns and used in combination to solve diverse prob­
lems. Still, at this point in his argument Darwin seems to be preserving 
the unique status of humans against other animals, something that his 
own theory of evolution was thought implicitly to challenge. But then 
comes one of the lines that make this book so famous in the study of 
animal behavior:
Nevertheless the difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as 
it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind. We have seen that the senses and 
intuitions, the various emotions and faculties, such as love, memory, atten­
tion, curiosity, imitation, reason, etc., of which man boasts, may be found in 
an incipient, or even sometimes in a well-­developed condition, in the lower 
animals. They are also capable of some inherited improvement, as we see in 
the domestic dog compared with the wolf or jackal. If it could be proved that 
certain high mental powers, such as the formation of general concepts, self-­
consciousness, etc., were absolutely peculiar to man, which seems extremely 
doubtful, it is not improbable that these qualities are merely the incidental 
results of other highly-­advanced intellectual faculties; and these again mainly 
the result of the continued use of a perfect language.16
Note the appearance of language, once again, as an explanation of the 
line between human and nonhuman animal, even as Darwin is in the 
process of blurring its sharpness. When Darwin made the claim that the

CHAPTER 4
differences are "one of degree and not of kind," it was seen as revolution­
ary. Today it might be orthodoxy.
Over the years, a wide range of differentiating characteristics between 
humans and nonhuman animals has been offered. Whether it is language 
itself, memory, tool use, a moral sense, the ability to form future plans 
and to reason hypothetically or subjunctively, to perform cause and effect 
analysis, or to display grief or humor, each has been claimed as solely 
human and each subject to triumphant counterexamples by biologists 
and zoologists.17 As the great primatologist and ethologist Frans de Waal 
puts it in his accurately titled book Are We Smart Enough to Know How 
Smart Animals Are?:
Everyone must have noticed the avalanche of knowledge emerging over the last 
few decades, diffused rapidly over the Internet. Almost every week there is a new 
finding regarding sophisticated animal cognition, often with compelling vid­
eos to back it up. We hear that rats may regret their own decisions, that crows 
manufacture tools, that octopuses recognize human faces, and that special neu­
rons allow monkeys to learn from each other's mistakes. We speak openly about 
culture in animals and about their empathy and friendships. Nothing is off 
limits anymore, not even the rationality that was once considered humanity's 
trademark.18
The kind of skepticism that de Waal voices is now clearly ascendant. It 
fits our era well, in multiple ways.
First, we are surely right to doubt that anything about us—­our planet's 
position in the solar system, the importance of our particular country, 
race, religion, or gender—­is somehow central or privileged or different. 
The many psychological temptations to form that cognitive bias are also 
the best reasons to resist it. Does that not extend to the species barrier? 
The next chapter will expand on this point in the context of chimeras, 
hybrids, and transgenic entities like my hypothetical Chimpy.
Second, anthropogenic climate change looks less like the actions of a 
species rightly given dominion over all that crawls or walks or flies on our 
planet and more like handing the car keys to the drunk guy at the party 
because he says he is the smartest person in the room. In environmental 
terms, at least, Mark Twain's comment seems precisely on point: "Man is 
the only animal that blushes. Or needs to."19
Finally, advances in ethology, the study of animal behavior, have 
made many of the confident distinctions of yesteryear seem empirically

questionable. Those studies have been widely spread, finding a receptive 
audience among both those who like YouTube videos of animals doing 
cool stuff and those committed to the rights of nonhuman animals. The 
latter group focuses not just on evidence of mental sophistication but 
also on many characteristics that, to the human eye, look like grief, or 
humor, or ethics. As in the discussion of AI, we heatedly debate whether 
this is irrational anthropomorphism or justified empathy, unscientific 
projection of our own mental states onto animal behavior or rational 
solidarity that reaches across an arbitrary line erected on the basis of 
question-­begging moral reasoning.20
These are powerful reasons to be skeptical. Still, even Darwin notes 
that the differences between human and animal are "immense," particu­
larly in the matter of abstract thought. Are we to dismiss these differences 
as unimportant? De Waal notes the significance of language and abstract 
reasoning to our conceptions of ourselves, but he moves quickly, if not to 
ridicule it, at least to minimize it and deny its epistemological, or perhaps 
I mean entomological, importance:
We obviously attach immense importance to abstract thought and language 
(a penchant that I am not about to mock while writing a book!) but in the 
larger scheme of things this is only one way to face the problem of survival. In 
sheer numbers and biomass, ants and termites may have done a better job than 
we have, focusing on tight coordination among colony members rather than 
individual thought. Each society operates like a self-­organized mind, albeit one 
pitter-­pattering around on thousands of little feet.21
This has the unmistakable ring of two sides talking eloquently past each 
other. On the one hand, it is important to understand that whatever char­
acteristic one focuses on, from language and tool use to time sense and 
emotion, nonhuman animals may be more sophisticated than we have 
realized. On the other, if you had told Aristotle that his argument was 
wrong because ants and termites have greater "numbers and biomass" or 
compared their intelligence to that of humans, assuming that the metric 
for judgment is comparative success as a survival strategy, he would have 
rightly thought you were missing his point. Logos, ethos, nomos, and polis—­
reason, ethics, law, and political community—­find no place in a hive.
True, these qualities matter to us because we are, well, us. True, it is our 
species-­centric perspective that gives them significance. Were the termite

CHAPTER 4
hive to be capable of joining the conversation—­which, and to me this 
seems a fact of positively luminous significance, it very much isn't—­it 
would doubtless beg to differ. Yet that seems to miss the point. De Waal 
attempts to convince us using the trump card of the evolutionary science 
perspective: we should valorize types of consciousness based on their sur­
vival potential, not their capacity to encompass reason, ethics, law, love, 
or beauty. Of course, evolutionary science does not matter to the hive, 
at least when it is considered as an argument rather than a brute fact. 
The hive doesn't do argument. It matters to us, though. Thus, de Waal's 
method of arguing against the special status of human consciousness 
seems to demonstrate something important. As we attempt to determine 
both the facts and the ethos of the divide between humans and other ani­
mals, we must start from within our linguistically structured, abstractly 
reasoned—­that is, our very human—­perspective. We have nowhere else 
to stand. Can we fail, then, to accord those qualities particular signif­
icance? Arguing, using abstract logic, about the irrelevance of abstract 
thought involves an obvious performative contradiction.
Earlier I quoted Samuel Butler, whose Book of the Machines parodied 
particular arguments about evolution by paralleling them in predicting 
the eventual emergence of machine intelligence from humble steam 
engines and cuckoo clocks. Butler's parody was then taken as a sincere, 
and perhaps accurate, prediction by some computer scientists working 
on AI. Likewise, remember Butler's tongue-­in-­cheek homage to potato 
intelligence:
Even a potato in a dark cellar has a certain low cunning about him which serves 
him in excellent stead. He knows perfectly well what he wants and how to get it. 
He sees the light coming from the cellar window and sends his shoots crawling 
straight thereto: they will crawl along the floor and up the wall and out at the 
cellar window; . . . we can imagine him saying, "I will have a tuber here and a 
tuber there, and I will suck whatsoever advantage I can from all my surround­
ings. This neighbour I will overshadow, and that I will undermine; and what I 
can do shall be the limit of what I will do. He that is stronger and better placed 
than I, shall overcome me and him that is weaker I will overcome." The potato 
says these things by doing them, which is the best of languages. What is con­
sciousness if this is not consciousness?22
On the one hand, when I read de Waal and his colleagues, I experi­
ence the same moral stroboscope that Blade Runner produced in the scene

with the mannequins and the androids. Today's ethologists offer power­
ful critiques of the blindness, both zoological and moral, produced by 
the assumption of human uniqueness. The complex subtlety of animal 
cognition and survival strategy revealed by their studies is remarkable 
and humbling. On the other hand, there are moments when the equiva­
lencies seem both overdrawn and inapposite, when de Waal's sincere ode 
to termite consciousness sounds very like Butler's satirical ode to spud 
sentience.
Again, it should be noted that if the goal is for us to do better in our 
treatment of other species, there are alternatives to the attempt to mini­
mize species differences. For example, imagine a person who says, "I am 
proud to belong to the only species that worries about the ethics of its 
treatment of other species, and that philosophizes and moralizes to try 
and get the balance right." Leopards do not have dinner-­table arguments 
about the morality of eating antelopes. Someone could reasonably believe 
that the special aspects of human moral consciousness are precisely the 
qualities that require us to treat nonhuman animals far better than we do 
now. The perception of qualitative differences could fuel anxious musing 
on moral obligation rather than complacent entitlement. Difference does 
not have to mean unregulated dominion.
While claims like de Waal's are in the ascendant, they have also been 
subject to strong pushback from those who argue that the differences 
between human and nonhuman animal consciousness are enormous and 
consequential and that some of the similarities between human and non­
human animal cognition both are overblown and lack the moral signifi­
cance attributed to them. Marc Hauser, who uses the term "humanique" 
to describe human consciousness, provides a spirited example:
Charles Darwin argued in his 1871 book The Descent of Man that the difference 
between human and nonhuman minds is "one of degree and not of kind." 
Scholars have long upheld that view, pointing in recent years to genetic evi­
dence showing that we share some 98 percent of our genes with chimpanzees. 
But if our shared genetic heritage can explain the evolutionary origin of the 
human mind, then why isn't a chimpanzee writing this essay, or singing backup 
for the Rolling Stones or making a soufflé? Indeed, mounting evidence indicates 
that, in contrast to Darwin's theory of a continuity of mind between humans 
and other species, a profound gap separates our intellect from the animal kind. 
This is not to say that our mental faculties sprang fully formed out of nowhere.

CHAPTER 4
Researchers have found some of the building blocks of human cognition in 
other species. But these building blocks make up only the cement footprint of 
the skyscraper that is the human mind.23
Hauser's work is interesting because he attempts to delineate the pre­
cise qualities of human cognition that, he claims, form a radical disjunc­
ture with the rest of the animal world. In his words:
[i]	
Generative computation enables humans to create a virtually limitless 
variety of words, concepts and things. The characteristic encompasses two 
types of operation: recursive and combinatorial. Recursion is the repeated 
use of a rule to create new expressions. The combinatorial operation is the 
mixing of discrete elements to engender new ideas.
[ii]	 Promiscuous combination of ideas allows the mingling of different domains 
of knowledge—­such as art, sex, space, causality and friendship—­thereby 
generating new laws, social relationships and technologies.
[iii]	 Mental symbols encode sensory experiences both real and imagined, form­
ing the basis of a rich and complex system of communication. Such sym­
bols can be kept to oneself or expressed to others as words or pictures.
[iv]	 Abstract thought permits contemplation of things beyond what we can see, 
hear, touch, taste or smell.24
Surely at least some of my readers will be tempted to create a sentence 
that embodies every example in Hauser's second distinctive capability: 
humans can "mingl[e] . . . different domains of knowledge—­such as art, 
sex, space, causality and friendship—­thereby generating new laws, social 
relationships and technologies." How about this? "I have invited you to 
my lodgings not merely to look at my etchings but because I feel that 
prolonged coitus would provide us with the basis of a lifelong friendship. 
Also, maybe we could start a dating app called Tinder?"
Yet the facetious hypothetical statement proves Hauser's point per­
fectly. The cliché of the amorous suitor's pretextual etchings25 comes 
from a particular moment in comedy now disappearing with the swipe-­
right world of dating apps, perhaps to be replaced with "U up?" The abil­
ity to invoke the cliché in turn depends on a culture that is shared in 
written, oral, and audiovisual ways across time with people one has never 
met. Dorothy Parker and James Thurber still make me laugh, though they 
died in the 1960s. The ability to say one thing and mean another presup­
poses both that shared culture and multilevel semantic signaling, and it 
combines them in a sense of humor that finds its origin in setting up, 
and then subverting, expectations. The ability to imagine creating a new

company, an abstraction that we spent the last chapter picking apart, that 
uses a new communications technology based on multiple synergistic 
innovations to transform a social realm, dating, is remarkable. Finally, the 
play on words that forms the company's trademark—­intellectual prop­
erty being another fascinating human creation—­relies on the notion of 
a technology that fuels the spark of attraction to produce the fires of 
romance. Yet another double meaning, in this case based on two distinct 
metaphors.
So my silly flight of fancy embodies every aspect of Hauser's second 
capacity. In fact, it embodies all of his four capacities. Yet all this was 
conveyed to you in a mere 41 words. Explaining it to an ape or a dolphin 
is beyond the bounds of possibility.
Differences like this make scientists such as Hauser think that Darwin 
is wrong and that our consciousness is qualitatively different from non­
human animals. He does not therefore assume that our consciousness is 
the end of the line. In terms that sound eerily similar to the discussion of 
AI and the Singularity, he even imagines an evolved, or perhaps geneti­
cally engineered, being that would be as different from us as we are from 
the chimpanzee: "Such change would give birth to a novel mind, one that 
would look on its ancestors as we often look on ours: with respect, curios­
ity, and a sense that we are alone, paragons in a world of simple minds."26 
Paragons in a world of simple minds—­this is a difference indeed.
Tommy's lawyers, by contrast, avoided both extremes in this debate. 
Their arguments begin from the same place. If we ask ourselves what 
justifies the special status of human beings and attempt to go beyond 
circular species fetishism (i.e., we are special because we are us) or genetic 
essentialism (i.e., only humans have all the components of human DNA) 
then we must turn to certain features of human consciousness that 
most humans have or potentially have. Why the qualification "poten­
tially have"? The person in a coma or the anencephalic child may lack 
these attributes but most of us would consider it an act of unspeakable 
evil to treat them less well as a result. There, species loyalty seems more 
acceptable—­perhaps because it is invoked to protect those who cannot 
protect themselves, to remedy failures of compassion, to be more inclu­
sive rather than exclusionary. Most of the time, though, it is in aspects of 
our consciousness that exceptionalism finds its moral justification.

CHAPTER 4
Tommy's lawyers were not claiming that nonhuman animal minds are 
the same as human minds or that their abilities in language and abstract 
thought are as great. Their claim was merely—­and I italicize the word 
because the claim is still revolutionary—­that some nonhuman animals 
have enough of the mental capacities of humans to make them morally 
compelling candidates for legal personality.
Chimpanzees are autonomous, self-­determined, self-­aware, intelligent, and 
emotionally complex. Cognitively they resemble human beings. . . . Tommy's 
genetics and physiology have produced a brain that allows him the capacities of 
autonomy, self-­determination, self-­awareness, and the ability to choose how to 
live his life, as well as the generally cognitive and emotional complexity suffi­
cient for common law personhood and the possession of the common law right 
to bodily liberty protected by the common law writ of habeas corpus.27
I found their briefs to be fine examples of the lawyer's art but also to be 
moving and instructive. They are fine examples because they exemplify 
well-­honed legal craftsmanship, melding science, ethics, and precedent 
to make compelling an argument that would initially strike many as out­
landish. One job of the lawyer is to show how some apparently radical 
change actually has firm roots in the dense subsoil of our legal culture. 
Tommy's lawyers do just that. With multiple citations and quotations 
from jurisprudential works, their briefs manage to separate the question 
of whether chimpanzees are human from the question of whether they 
are legal persons. Now the reader feels the burden of proof, though still 
high, is a little lower. Then they offer a theory about what legal person­
hood requires that allows the reader to see the claim as provocative and 
intriguing rather than silly and ungrounded. That is the first step toward 
acceptance. It does not win the debate but it gets you into the room in 
which it is being held.
The briefs are moving because each scientifically backed, evidence-­
based insight about chimpanzees' minds is coupled to an empathic con­
juring of what that means for Tommy in his concrete cell. The ability 
to think about both past and future makes imprisonment all the more 
painful: a life sentence means little to a being who lives every day in 
the present. The fact that chimpanzees are autonomous, that they can 
engage in deferred gratification, that they can make plans that reach into 
the future, all of that gets the reader or the judge thinking about how

177
this is one of the criteria we value so much about human minds. Their 
sociability and their communicative capacities make isolation more inju­
rious. The fact that many researchers believe they can experience grief, 
regret, and compassion, that they can be strategic, cooperate, and even 
engage in deception28—­all of this sparks the leap of empathy I described 
in the first chapter. Why are we putting this amazing being in solitary 
confinement? That is the empathic flash. But at the very same moment, 
it demands we provide an intellectual justification of our human excep­
tionalism as well, using criteria that do not require that we bring Tommy 
over the line with us.
If autonomy, complexity of mind, a moral sense, communicative abili­
ties, intelligence, test-­performance at the same level as a small child, and 
the ability to plan for the future do not entitle an entity to legal rights, 
then why do we deserve legal rights? In the words of Tommy's lawyers:
[C]himpanzees possess those complex cognitive abilities sufficient for common 
law personhood and the common law right to bodily liberty, as a matter of 
liberty, equality, or both. . . . Their most significant cognitive ability is "auton­
omy," which subsumes many of their other cognitive abilities. These include, 
but are not limited to, their possession of an autobiographical self, episodic 
memory, self-­determination, self-­consciousness, self-­knowingness, self-­agency, 
referential and intentional communication, empathy, a working memory, lan­
guage, metacognition, numerosity, and material, social, and symbolic culture, 
their ability to plan, engage in mental time-­travel, intentional action, sequen­
tial learning, mediational learning, mental state modeling, visual perspective-­
taking, cross-­modal perception, their ability to understand cause-­and-­effect, the 
experiences of others, to imagine, imitate, engage in deferred imitation, emu­
late, to innovate and to use and make tools.29
To be fair, critics have cast doubt on statements like this, claiming 
that we are anthropomorphizing the animals by projecting our emotions 
and mental processes on them. They argue that it is particularly hard 
to rely on experiments with animals that have been raised in ways they 
never would have been in the wild, chimpanzees who have been taught 
American Sign Language, for example.30 Could the supposedly advanced 
behavior be the result of enculturation to seem more human? This is, 
of course, the same skepticism we have seen with AI. Did we put the 
human behavior into the entity in the first place only to be fooled by the 
mimicry we ourselves elicited into calling it kinship? The skepticism is

CHAPTER 4
understandable but it is hard not to be impressed by the range and inge­
nuity of the experiments that back up claims like those made on behalf 
of Tommy. At the very least, scientists in the camp of de Waal and Darwin 
are surely right that there has been a hubristic ignorance in our assump­
tion of complete and total superiority, of a qualitative difference from all 
other animals. Dispelling this ignorance has moral consequences.
I say that even though their arguments are sometimes overstated. 
Tommy's lawyers claimed, "In short, there is no essential difference 
between what words chimpanzees learn mean to them, and what words 
humans learn mean to them."31 Actually, I am pretty sure that when I 
read "language is the cracked kettle on which we beat out our tunes for 
bears to dance to, when all the while we long to move the stars them­
selves to pity"32 something different is happening in my brain than 
when a chimpanzee learns a sign for "many" or "later" or "sad." The con­
notations, resonances, and metaphoric representations of those words 
transport me, bring me a sense of bittersweet beauty and loss. They even, 
arguably, undo themselves. Flaubert is using language superbly to cap­
ture an ineffable feeling he says language cannot capture. That is our 
species at its self-­lacerating, self-­contradicting best. But you do not need 
to be Flaubert to be human and you do not need to be human in order 
to be a legal person.
That takes us to the second and perhaps more surprising leg of the 
argument: the claims made by animal rights groups that the law already 
recognizes the legal personality of nonhuman animals and has done so 
for years.
THE LEGAL RIGHTSHOLDER ARGUMENT
It is said that Bartholomew Chassenee, a distinguished French jurist of the six­
teenth century (born at Issy-­l'Eveque in 1480), made his reputation at the bar as 
counsel for some rats, which had been put on trial before the ecclesiastical court 
of Autun on the charge of having feloniously eaten up and wantonly destroyed 
the barley-­crop of that province. . . . [H]e excused the default or non-­appearance 
of his clients on the ground of the length and difficulty of the journey and the 
serious perils which attended it, owing to the unwearied vigilance of their mor­
tal enemies, the cats, who watched all their movements, and, with fell intent, 
lay in wait for them at every corner and passage.33

179
The rats of Autun begin many a discussion of the legal personality of ani­
mals. Partly, it is the charm of E. P. Evans's prose that manages to mix medi­
eval jurisprudence with the plotline of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Partly, it 
is the magnificent obsession that led Evans to track down just so many 
bizarre-­sounding legal cases involving animals. The table of contents is 
endlessly and darkly fascinating; Borges meets animal jurisprudence:
Criminal prosecution of field-­mice; Vermin excommunicated by the Bishop 
of Lausanne; Protocol of judicial proceedings against caterpillars; Conjurers of 
cabbage-­worms; Swallows proscribed by a Protestant parson; Custom of writing 
letters of advice to rats; Writs of ejectment served on them; Rhyming rats in 
Ireland; Capital punishment of larger quadrupeds; . . . Beasts burned and buried 
alive and put to the rack; Swine executed for infanticide; An ox decapitated for 
its demerits; Punishment of buggery.34
Apparently the last-­named offense was shockingly frequent. The guilty 
person and his animal victim were generally executed together, though 
in at least one case mercy was shown. Jacques Ferron's donkey was seen as 
"the victim of violence [who] had not participated in her master's crime 
of her own free will."35 The citizens of the commune signed a certificate 
attesting to her virtue and modest character. She was acquitted.
Research on the tradition of legal personification of animals reveals 
that there were a multitude of motivations at work. One was a theory 
of demonic possession and witchcraft. The animal was punished not 
because of anthropomorphism but diabolism, from a desire to make some 
bad event understandable by attributing it to evil spirits or demons that 
had possessed the animal. The punishment of the animal was really an 
attack on the demon and a symbolic closing of the book on whatever evil 
had occurred, from loss of crops because of a plague of insects, to prop­
erty damage caused by a maddened horse, to the death of a child killed 
by a pig. Another strain of animal personalization was merely semantic, 
a symbolic representation for the purposes of evidence. The cow stood in 
for, signified, the livestock on the farm and thus for the interests of the 
farmer. A third, found in the common law's practice of "deodand," was 
a kind of reparative justice, arguably one both well suited to an era of 
lower monetary liquidity and somehow more emotionally satisfying to 
the bystanders. As Evans puts it in language that makes you remember 
that the book dates from 1906:

CHAPTER 4
The childish disposition to punish irrational creatures and inanimate objects, 
which is common to the infancy of individuals and of races, has left a distinct 
trace of itself in that peculiar institution of English law known as deodand, and 
derived partly from Jewish and partly from old German usages and traditions. 
"If a horse," says Blackstone, "or any other animal, of its own motion kill as well 
an infant as an adult, or if a cart run over him, they shall in either case be for­
feited as deodand." If a man, in driving a cart, tumble to the ground and lose his 
life by the wheel passing over him, if a tree fall on a man and cause his death, or 
if a horse kick his keeper and kill him, then the wheel, the tree and the horse are 
deodands pro rege, and are to be sold for the benefit of the poor.36
In all these examples, animals are the subjects of legal duties or penal­
ties, or at least the law recognizes them sufficiently to make them a locus 
for punishment or redistribution of wealth or a symbol for some human 
activity or interest. But the current suits for nonhuman animals are claim­
ing more: that the package of rights and duties already bestowed by the 
law on animals logically entails that they be recognized as legal persons. 
This is where animal rights activists turn Cohen and John Dewey's argu­
ments on their head. Cohen had said to "call something a person in law, 
is merely to state, in metaphorical language, that it can be sued."37 Dewey 
put it similarly: "In saying that 'person' might legally mean whatever the 
law makes it mean, I am trying to say that 'person' might be used simply 
as a synonym for a right-­and-­duty-­bearing unit. Any such unit would be 
a person; such a statement would be truistic, tautological."38 Tommy's 
lawyers invert the argument. Tommy has a package of legal rights and 
duties. They tried to demonstrate this by making him the beneficiary of 
a trust created under a New York state law that specifically allowed for 
nonhuman animals as beneficiaries. Tommy is clearly "a right-­and-­duty-­
bearing unit," they argued, and therefore a fortiori a legal person. Once 
the state of New York created the statute allowing animals to have legal 
rights, exercised by a trustee or next friend, it had already taken the step 
of recognizing them as legal persons.
Does this argument hold water? In one sense, Dewey and Cohen's rea­
soning is clearly helpful to Tommy's lawyers. Both of them viewed legal 
personhood not through the lens of some essentialist real entity theory 
but rather as a rationally chosen social construct. Personhood is a box 
society created, filled with whatever mixture of rights and duties society 
chooses. We should not reify, hypostasize, or thing-­ify legal personhood

and assume, for example, that because corporations are legal persons, 
they automatically get all the rights and duties that natural persons, 
humans, do. In decoupling legal personhood from humanity and in 
stressing that we can shape legal personality into whatever we choose, 
Cohen and Dewey are telling the New York judges who heard Tommy's 
case that they are free to expand or contract the boundaries of legal per­
sonality as they wish. In that sense, nothing logically requires the judges 
to hold that Tommy needs to be genetically human in order to be a legal 
person. So far so good.
But the animal rights activists and lawyers are going further. At its 
most extreme, their argument holds that as soon as the law confers even 
one right or duty on a nonhuman animal it is logically required to grant, 
indeed has already recognized, legal personhood. You could use Cohen 
or Dewey's rhetoric to reach that position, I suppose. Tommy is a right-­
bearing, if not a duty-­bearing, unit. Yet I do not think the argument 
follows, either on Cohen or Dewey's premises or those Tommy's lawyers 
set forth.
True, the nominalist, socially constructed view of legal personality 
shows that nothing stops us from making legal personhood diverge sub­
stantially from natural, human personhood. But it also shows that merely 
because the law gives an entity one or two rights or duties does not mean 
it is required to recognize full legal personality. If one argues a concept is 
nominalist and socially constructed, one cannot then turn around and 
say that the essential nature of the concept requires its extension to this case 
or that. Once you see legal personality as a choice, a box filled with what­
ever rights and duties society chooses, you cannot then consistently say 
that the existence of one right (being a trust beneficiary) entails the exis­
tence of many others (such as the right protected by the writ of habeas 
corpus). One can't be a nominalist at step one and then an essentialist at 
step two. Indeed, that was the very argument the realists were opposing 
in the context of corporations: that the fact that corporations had the 
power to sue to enforce contracts or protect property required or entailed 
that they have a full suite of other rights. True, the US Supreme Court 
seems to have drifted into that assumption where corporate speech rights 
are concerned, but, as Justice William Rehnquist pointed out many years 
ago, they did so without argument or discussion.

CHAPTER 4
The New York Supreme Court Appellate Division was explicit in reject­
ing the claim that the existence of any legal right automatically con­
ferred personhood. In fact, it went further. The reason that Tommy was 
not already a legal person was that he lacked the set of rights and duties 
required and entailed by a social contract:
While petitioner proffers various justifications for affording chimpanzees, such 
as Tommy, the liberty rights protected by such writ, the ascription of rights 
has historically been connected with the imposition of societal obligations and 
duties. Reciprocity between rights and responsibilities stems from principles 
of social contract, which inspired the ideals of freedom and democracy at the 
core of our system of government. Under this view, society extends rights in 
exchange for an express or implied agreement from its members to submit to 
social responsibilities.39
But not all of the judges who heard the case were persuaded by that argu­
ment. In a later appeal, Judge Eugene M. Fahey's concurring opinion 
sounded a more skeptical note:
Even if it is correct, however, that nonhuman animals cannot bear duties, the 
same is true of human infants or comatose human adults, yet no one would 
suppose that it is improper to seek a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of one's 
infant child or a parent suffering from dementia. In short, being a "moral agent" 
who can freely choose to act as morality requires is not a necessary condition of 
being a "moral patient" who can be wronged and may have the right to redress 
wrongs. . . . The better approach in my view is to ask not whether a chimpanzee 
fits the definition of a person or whether a chimpanzee has the same rights and 
duties as a human being, but instead whether he or she has the right to liberty 
protected by habeas corpus. . . . Does an intelligent nonhuman animal who 
thinks and plans and appreciates life as human beings do have the right to the 
protection of the law against arbitrary cruelties and enforced detentions visited 
on him or her? This is not merely a definitional question, but a deep dilemma 
of ethics and policy that demands our attention. To treat a chimpanzee as if he 
or she had no right to liberty protected by habeas corpus is to regard the chim­
panzee as entirely lacking independent worth, as a mere resource for human 
use, a thing the value of which consists exclusively in its usefulness to others.40
Despite the fact that he eventually voted to deny the appeal, Fahey was 
clearly troubled. For him, Tommy's lawyers had put the line in question. 
Not the line of full legal personhood perhaps, but some intermediate 
status with rights far greater than those now extended to nonhuman 
animals.

Tommy is far from the only animal plaintiff in US courts, many of 
which do not claim legal personhood but do claim legal standing—­the 
legal status necessary to bring a case. They range from the Hawaiian hon­
eycreeper Palila bird, which a court found has "legal status and wings 
its way into federal court as a plaintiff in its own right,"41 to the whales, 
dolphins, and porpoises in the charmingly named case The Cetacean Com­
munity v. Bush.42 (They lost). There is even the case of Naruto, the photo-­
snapping crested macaque on behalf of whom its "next friends" People 
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) raised a copyright claim. That 
argument led a distinguished appellate court to rule as follows: "We must 
determine whether a monkey may sue humans, corporations, and com­
panies for damages and injunctive relief arising from claims of copyright 
infringement. Our court's precedent requires us to conclude that the monkey's 
claim has standing under Article III of the United States Constitution. None­
theless, we conclude that this monkey—­and all animals, since they are 
not human—­lacks statutory standing under the Copyright Act."43
Legal observers sometimes view these cases as the blooper roll of 
"standing jurisprudence"—­the embarrassing outtakes in which courts 
make themselves ridiculous by seriously entertaining absurd claims by 
nonhumans to have the right to sue in US courts. Even though there is 
a very famous law review article asking whether trees have standing,44 
many people think it silly to have courts waste their time on copyright 
claims for monkey selfies or the legal status of cetaceans (presumably) 
outraged by the US Navy's low-­frequency sonar. I disagree. Actually, the 
legal system shows well in these cases, far better than it did in the case 
of corporate personhood. The courts write thoughtful decisions, carefully 
weighing arguments ranging from legal text and precedent to constitu­
tional requirements, to philosophy and morality. Their decisions also tell 
us a lot about the likely future path of cases brought by or on behalf of 
AIs and hybrids, chimeras, and transgenic species. Here are three specific 
insights they provide.
1  WHO SPEAKS FOR THE VOICELESS?
The first thing we can learn from the suits brought by nonhuman ani­
mals is a point lawyers may obsess about too much but everyone else

CHAPTER 4
considers too little: administrability. It is one thing if Hal and the Chimpy 
address us directly, as the moving parties articulating their own interests. 
But for many of the claims I consider in this book, including claims by 
Tommy or Naruto or the cetaceans, those claims are advanced by other 
humans who purport to be acting in their interests. The same will prob­
ably be true even for most of the genetic hybrids and chimeras I consider 
in the next chapter. That presents its own set of issues. In the standing 
cases for nonhuman animals, the suits are often brought by organizations 
such as PETA, claiming "next-­friend standing" to speak for the animal. 
But can we trust such a procedure? As one judge puts it:
Animal-­next-­friend standing is particularly susceptible to abuse. Allowing 
next-­friend standing on behalf of animals allows lawyers (as in Cetacean) and 
various interest groups (as here) to bring suit on behalf of those animals or 
objects with no means or manner to ensure the animals' interests are truly 
being expressed or advanced. Such a change would fundamentally alter the 
litigation landscape. Institutional actors could simply claim some form of rela­
tionship to the animal or object to obtain standing and use it to advance their 
own institutional goals with no means to curtail those actions. To some extent, 
as humans, we have a general understanding of the similar interests of other 
humans. . . . But the interests of animals? We are really asking what another 
species desires.45
The court went on to point out that PETA was quick to try to dismiss 
the case and to obtain a settlement when it appeared it might lose—­all 
without clear evidence that this was what Naruto would desire, and argu­
ably focusing on the organization's own interests rather than those of the 
monkey. To put it differently, contemplating legal personality for nonhu­
man entities requires us to come up with rules about who may speak for 
them. The answer to that question is far from obvious. Indeed, one of the 
great attractions of Tommy's case—­a brave nonprofit trying to expand 
the time-­honored right of the unjustly confined to cover a new, morally 
neglected population—­may also be one of its weaknesses. Who gets to 
speak for those without voices? The good news is that law does in fact 
have potential resources to deal with these issues: judicially appointed 
conservators or guardians ad litem or concepts similar to "the best inter­
ests of the child" that are to be assessed separately from the claims made 
by the parties actually in the courtroom. But we have barely begun to 
think through these issues in the context of animal personhood.

2  WHAT METHOD SHOULD COURTS USE TO ANSWER 
THESE QUESTIONS?
The second important thing we learn from the animal standing cases is 
the importance of interpretive technique in answering the questions sur­
rounding personhood. The current tendency in the courts is frequently to 
declare a commitment to "originalism" and "textualism" and sometimes 
to employ them as methods when interpreting statutes and the Constitu­
tion. Quotidian practice reveals that judges of all jurisprudential stripes 
are much more pluralist and ecumenical in their approaches in run-­of-­
the-­mill cases than their thundering methodological sermons, especially 
in confirmation hearings, would suggest. That public commitment, how­
ever, is likely to have real force in the kinds of controversies I am writing 
about here.
The originalist or textualist judge is unlikely to be moved, at least 
openly, by amicus curiae briefs from moral philosophers or musings on 
cognitive psychology. They will argue that constitutional and statutory 
terms must be interpreted according to their "original public meaning," 
the way the terms were understood when the provision was enacted. 
Whatever we might think of personhood now or 30 years from now, 
thoughts of AI or chimeras were far from the minds of the framers and 
ratifiers of the Constitution:
No one, we presume, supposes that any change in public opinion or feeling . . . 
should induce the court to give to the words of the Constitution a more liberal 
construction . . . than they were intended to bear when the instrument was 
framed or adopted. If any of its provisions are deemed unjust, there is a mode 
prescribed in the instrument itself by which it may be amended: but while it 
remains unaltered, it must be construed now as it was understood at the time 
of its adoption.46
This, somewhat unfortunately for originalists, is a quotation from Dred 
Scott v. Sandford, one of worst decisions in constitutional history. The enti­
ties whom Justice Robert B. Taney was busily writing out of the guaran­
tees in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence were not 
AIs or transgenic species, of course. They were human beings—­enslaved 
African Americans. Taney even quotes the majestic words of the Decla­
ration of Independence. "We hold these truths to be self-­evident: that 
all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with

CHAPTER 4
certain unalienable rights; that among them is life, liberty, and the pur­
suit of happiness; that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted, 
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."47 But he 
moves quickly to reassure the reader that originalism reveals that these 
words do not mean what they appear to.
The general words . . . would seem to embrace the whole human family, and 
if they were used in a similar instrument at this day would be so understood. 
But it is too clear for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended 
to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed and adopted 
this declaration; for if the language, as understood in that day, would embrace 
them, the conduct of the distinguished men who framed the Declaration of 
Independence would have been utterly and flagrantly inconsistent with the 
principles they asserted; and instead of the sympathy of mankind, to which 
they so confidently appealed, they would have deserved and received universal 
rebuke and reprobation.48
The Supreme Court, later so solicitous of the constitutional rights of the 
artificial persons called corporations, was able to use an originalist read­
ing to deny that solicitude to actual human beings. If we can be bru­
tally indifferent to the claims of members of our own species, then surely 
an originalist approach dooms constitutional claims made by human-­
animal transgenic species or Artificial Intelligences?
Originalism is inhospitable rhetorical ground for Tommy, let alone for 
Hal or the Chimpy, though the point can be overstated, in part because 
of the openness and malleability of what originalism means. In Second 
Amendment cases, originalists do not limit the meaning of "arms" to 
those weapons that were available at the end of the eighteenth century. 
Original public meaning does not tell me what the level of generality 
of the relevant term is. Arms available then? Arms of equivalent power 
or use for self-­defense now? Arms necessary to pose a threat to a poten­
tially tyrannical government today, including tanks and planes or even 
software intrusion and hacking tools? Originalists such as Justice Anto­
nin Scalia can find that the Fourth Amendment protects against ther­
mal scanning of the outside of a house49 or GPS trackers attached to cars 
by law enforcement.50 Those are clearly not the "searches and seizures" 
the framers had in mind nor the original public meaning of the Fourth 
Amendment's words. Instead, we are generalizing from the principles and 
goals the Fourth Amendment had to today's reality and technology. To

187
be clear, that is a perfectly reasonable method of interpreting the law, 
and consistent with one type of originalism. However, if one accepts it in 
cases such as these, one can hardly condemn it as out of bounds when we 
are defining not "search" but rather the Constitution's mention of "per­
sons." Even if you are an originalist, you must choose a level of generality. 
This is not just calling balls and strikes.
The same issues appear in statutory interpretation. Textualist Justices 
found that Title VII protects against discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation merely because it prohibits discrimination "on the basis of 
sex."51 As a purely textual matter, the latter automatically includes the 
former, the majority argued. After all, the employer accepts male employ­
ees dating women, but not female employees. That is discrimination on 
the basis of sex! I am delighted with the result, but one does have to note 
that this "original public meaning" apparently escaped everyone when 
the statute was being passed, something that the dissent furiously and 
repeatedly pointed out.52 E pur si muove. That winning argument would 
have seemed absurd when Title VII was enacted. It would have "gone 
without saying" that the words did not have that meaning. Yet it recently 
attracted a majority on a conservative-­dominated Supreme Court, though 
with liberal Justices joining the opinion. In a world in which people fre­
quently interact with highly complex, apparently self-­aware AIs or look 
with dismay or delight at a genetically engineered indentured servant, 
the ludicrousness of a personhood claim might seem very different than 
it does today.
In short, interpretive methods are less constraining than their self-­
righteous invocations would suggest. Judges, particularly originalist and 
textualist judges, like to claim that the great thing about their methods is 
that "their hands are tied," but it turns out that there is a lot of slack in 
their jurisprudential bondage fantasy.
Nevertheless, given these public methodological commitments, at 
the moment it seems as if US courts would greet claims by Hal or the 
Chimpy with little sympathy, telling them that they need legislative or 
constitutional change to enlarge the rights accorded to them. In Ceta­
cean Community the court made this argument directly: "It is obvious 
that an animal cannot function as a plaintiff in the same manner as a 
juridically competent human being. But we see no reason why Article III

CHAPTER 4
prevents Congress from authorizing a suit in the name of an animal, any 
more than it prevents suits brought in the name of artificial persons such 
as corporations, partnerships or trusts, and even ships, or of juridically 
incompetent persons such as infants, juveniles, and mental incompe­
tents."53 That suggestion—­"you are making your arguments to the wrong 
entity"—­brings us to the final insight that the nonhuman animal cases 
offer about the questions I am exploring.
3  WHERE SHOULD WE MAKE THESE DECISIONS?
Why were arguments about personhood in the case of Tommy, the whales, 
and Naruto, the ape-­photographer, being addressed to courts rather than 
to the legislature? Leaving jurisprudence aside for the moment, would we 
not be better off as a matter of political theory and democratic legitimacy 
if decisions about the definition of personhood were made by legisla­
tures, not courts? My answer is perhaps. There are huge problems with 
unelected judges deciding to broaden or narrow the scope of personhood. 
Should it be judges who decide the rights of Hal, or the Chimpy, or even 
Tommy? There are also problems in allowing the legislature to do the 
same thing. Does the question of personhood not seem a matter of fun­
damental right, one not subject to legislative revision? This ambivalence 
exists regardless of one's political beliefs.
On one hand, think of the alarm that liberals feel toward cases such 
as Citizens United, which they see as the act of an unelected judiciary 
constitutionalizing the lobbying rights of corporate legal persons in a 
way that makes it impossible to limit them democratically short of a 
constitutional amendment. On the other, think of legislative attempts to 
declare fetuses to be legal persons. The same people who were outraged 
by the first decision as an intrusion by judges into a basic matter of dem­
ocratic self-­government called on judges to protect women from legisla­
tures, as they see it, illegitimately encroaching on fundamental rights. 
In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. 
Wade, the Supreme Court explicitly refused to do so, leaving legislators 
free to regulate abortion, and perhaps personhood, from the moment 
of conception. Now imagine a conservative being posed the question 
of which institution should decide the rights and limits of corporate

189
and fetal personhood—­courts or legislatures? It is, to put it mildly, 
complicated.
There are some reasons to think that legislatures are better at making 
complex decisions, particularly in areas of rapidly changing technology 
and evolving public morality. As a legal academic, I am required to add 
that those arguments tend to be advanced most fervently by people who 
have little practical experience of legislatures. The comment, popularly 
attributed to Otto von Bismarck, that "people who like law and sausages 
should watch neither being made" is, in my experience, deeply unfair to 
sausage makers. The same could be said for the virtues and vices of courts, 
of course. They can be portrayed as majestic temples of reason and prin­
ciple, isolated from the corruption and institutional capture of legisla­
tive politics and the passions of the mob. Yet they can also be portrayed 
as antidemocratic, unresponsive, elitist institutions with no expertise in 
the multifactorial balancing of interests and expertise that constitutes the 
legislative process. The reason these clichés exist—­and they are standard 
fare in any law school class54—­is because they are all true. Or, at least, 
they contain elements of the truth.
If you were a conservative in the 1890s, you probably would have seen 
courts as the last, best hope for the preservation of the constitutional 
rights of property and due process against the passions of populist or 
even socialist legislatures—­classical legal science pitted against redis­
tributive demagoguery. If you were a conservative in the 1960s, you 
would have seen the Warren Court as a lawless, antidemocratic insti­
tution disregarding precedent to legislate extremist politics from the 
bench. (Contemporary liberals might recognize the feeling.) If you were 
a progressive in those two periods, of course, your perception would have 
been exactly the opposite. In the 1890s, said liberals, circular arguments 
and conceptualist legal sophistry wrote laissez-­faire economic dogma 
into the common law, constitutionalized it, and thus defeated the will 
of the people. In the 1960s, courageous judges were the only ones who 
finally stood up and made the majestic words of the Civil War Amend­
ments, so long disregarded by racist legislatures, a reality for millions of 
Black Americans confronting the evils of segregation and disenfranchise­
ment. I lean toward the latter set of views, but dispassionately viewing 
jurisprudential history teaches me that merely reciting the positive and

CHAPTER 4
negative stereotypes about either institution does not advance the debate 
very much.
What then can we say about the correct institutional role of courts 
and legislatures in debates over personhood? In terms of institutional 
evolutionary survival value, each has advantages. Clichés aside, courts do 
some things well. In late 2020 and early 2021, consensus reality and con­
sensus political morality all but broke down in American democracy. Poli­
ticians knowingly urged absurd conspiracy theories. A large percentage 
of the population were convinced by factual claims that were obviously 
false. They still are. Some state legislatures went along for the ride as did 
extremist news and social media. Politicians, including the former presi­
dent, claimed that democratic election results could simply be ignored or 
overturned. This was, and I mean the term very seriously, a stress test for 
American democracy and one it came perilously close to failing.
In the midst of all of this, courts showed rather well. When faced with 
a barrage of voting conspiracy theories, almost every judge, including 
many Republican-­appointed or even Trump-­appointed judges, dismissed 
them out of hand. In fact, even the process of bringing the case chastened 
the claims that were being made. When it came to courtroom proceed­
ings, the same lawyers who were actively making looney-­tunes assertions 
on social media or cable news were suddenly more modest in what they 
argued. Why? Because our truth community has rules about, and pro­
fessional sanctions to enforce, the evidentiary quality of the claims you 
can make in front of a judge. As one colleague puts it, using the solemn 
professional language of the law, "Being in a courtroom means you can't 
just make shit up." Those who failed to heed those limits were some­
times professionally disciplined or sued for gigantic sums by the election 
software companies they had allegedly defamed. A media company, Fox 
News, was sued for knowingly promoting claims it knew to be untrue 
and eventually settled the case for $787 million. Law called falsehood to 
account, and the discovery process revealed the depths of insincerity and 
conscious falsehood at the highest levels of the company. Astoundingly, 
there was a reckoning and something like truth emerged from the pro­
cess. The system worked—­kind of. For certain values of "worked."
Think of courts and legislatures as having institutionally selective rhe­
torical gravity fields. In each, different arguments have different weight.

Or perhaps a better metaphor is institutional stereoscopic vision, where 
two views yield a more three-­dimensional result when combined. Issues 
are framed differently. "Cool" and "hot" arguments fare differently. Polit­
ical power and wealth matter in both, sadly, but in different ways. Their 
rules about the process for the institutional production of truth are pro­
foundly dissimilar. At their best, the systems are complementary, each 
helping to cure the excesses of the other, or one framing the issue so that 
the other makes a better decision. A set of pioneering private law cases 
claiming that air pollution fits within the tort of nuisance or that abu­
sive behavior by employers is sanctionable as the intentional infliction 
of emotional distress can help suggest the contours of a statutory scheme 
that protects against environmental damage or sexual harassment. A 
broadly written statute can be sensitively applied by a court to technolo­
gies wildly different than the ones the drafters had in mind.
Sometimes expert advice is heeded, sometimes ignored, and perhaps 
that is healthy. Changes in public opinion affect both, but in different 
ways. US constitutional law went, in 40 years, from saying that homo­
sexual sex could be criminalized55 to saying that there was a constitu­
tional right to marriage regardless of sexuality.56 Originalists asked angrily 
exactly when this right had "appeared."57 The same charges will be laid 
against the court that first gives greater protection to nonhumans. To 
accept a change like this would be to accept that our fundamental con­
stitutional values evolve! It implies that our conceptions of equal protec­
tion, due process, cruel and unusual punishment, or the right to bear arms 
change over time, interstitially, and that this tendency is a legitimate part 
of our law. In my view they do, and it is, both for better and for worse. 
Methodologically speaking, a pluralistic common law constitutionalism 
is our legal tradition, not an unswerving attachment to a single interpre­
tive method. Originalists who claim to root all constitutional interpreta­
tion in our history are curiously uninterested in this vital aspect of our 
actual legal history.
Yet all of this does not mean that courts are necessarily the right place 
to make these decisions. Courts did, in fact, play a vital role in the devel­
opment of corporate personality. But as the last chapter showed, it was 
not a well-­reasoned one. Indeed, it sometimes lacked any reasoning at all. 
They played a key, and shameful, role before and after the Civil War in

CHAPTER 4
dismissing constitutional claims made by African Americans. We hope, 
with some reason, that our legal traditions are better and more humane 
today. Yet our past performance, in both courts and legislatures, should 
make us distinctly modest about our institutional capacity for consti­
tutional, moral, and even technological insight about the personhood 
question.
The turn toward constitutional originalism may make courts even 
more hostile to novel personhood claims. At the same time, originalism's 
methodological imperialism—­this is the only true way of interpreting the 
law—­will make it harder for courts to play a role they have productively 
played in the past: venues for the introduction of new types of evidence 
and argument, from the statistical Brandeis brief58 to the amicus curiae 
who offer interdisciplinary evidence and perspective. Even when, in the 
end, courts turn away from being the final locus for a decision, as they 
did in Tommy's case, they play a useful societal role in first airing novel 
arguments in a setting that encourages rigorous logic, requires careful 
source attribution, and imposes ethical limits on the truth claims that 
practitioners may advance.
Courts may not, and perhaps should not, be the entities making the 
final decision. Yet courts are frequently the places where deep moral 
issues are first raised or gain attention, where they are publicly urged with 
passion and logic and a relentless attempt to hold a society to its ideals 
and not just its current practices.
Tommy is not the last atypical plaintiff who will be claiming person­
hood in a courtroom. That does not mean that the final decisions ulti­
mately will, or should, be made there. But the framework of the legal 
proceeding, the advantage it gives to careful logical and principled argu­
ment, the information it develops and then puts into the public sphere, 
all of these are likely to be hugely important in shaping the future debate. 
The process is likely to be chaotic, with some claims being raised in courts 
and others directly in legislatures or administrative agencies. In our fan­
tasies, we proceed with a philosophically coherent idea of personality in 
precisely the right institutions for the job. In practice, as the last chapter 
showed, we muddle through, often failing to justify and perhaps even to 
think through our decisions. Yet sparks of insight, empathy, and ratio­
nal analysis sometimes surface. They surprise us with the characteristic

painful sting of a hard insight, presaging momentous change. That pat­
tern is likely to continue when we turn to genetic hybrids or AIs.
Tommy lost. Yet his case is a profoundly suggestive one for the future 
of the personhood debate. I, for one, have been convinced that even if we 
do not label them as full persons, there is a morally overwhelming case 
for a special legal protective status for the great apes and perhaps the ceta­
ceans. Over time, arguments like this—­drip, drip, dripping against the 
rock of the status quo—­can change minds. And lines. More importantly, 
the lawsuit brought on Tommy's behalf, with its rich evocation of quali­
ties of mind, its mixture of science and empathy, moral syllogisms and 
precedential argument, its attempt to separate the status of legal rights­
holder from that of a member of the human species, all of that makes me 
a little more hopeful about our ability to make wise, good, but also just 
decisions about the infinitely strange Others with which the future will 
confront us.

TRANSGENIC ENTITIES, CHIMERAS, 
AND HYBRIDS
Presently, Irving Weissman, the director of Stanford University's Institute of 
Cancer/Stem Cell Biology and Medicine, is contemplating pushing the enve­
lope of chimera research even further by producing human-­mouse chimera 
whose brains would be composed of one hundred percent human cells. [In fact, 
only the neurons would be human-­derived. The glial cells would be normal 
mouse cells.] Weissman notes that the mice would be carefully watched: if they 
developed a mouse brain architecture, they would be used for research, but if 
they developed a human brain architecture or any hint of humanness, they 
would be killed.1
"Quick! Look dumb and eat cheese! The scientist is coming!" No flowers 
for this particular Algernon? This excerpt from a law review article makes 
the proposal sound deranged but in fact Weissman was commendably 
attentive to the ethical concerns. He asked for a bioethics report2 from 
his colleague Hank Greely, one of the most eminent scholars in that field. 
Weissman's lab did not proceed with this particular human-­mouse chi­
mera, though other labs have since done something similar. But his lab 
did pioneer the development of a different human-­mouse chimera, the 
SCID-­hu mouse, which has been extremely important in HIV research. 
It allows researchers to experiment on an animal that has many of the 
characteristics of a human with a compromised immune system without 
actually experimenting on human beings. My point is a simple one. We 
are already dealing with creatures that offer enormous research benefits 
and yet cause many to be deeply uncomfortable that a line, perhaps the 
line, is being crossed. That is the subject of this chapter.
So far, I have discussed personhood in the context of Artificial Intelli­
gence, corporations, and nonhuman animals. I turn now to the questions 
of personhood and moral duty as they affect transgenic species, chimeras,

CHAPTER 5
and hybrids. Before diving into that discussion, some clarity about defini­
tions is worthwhile.
A hybrid . . . is an organism that results from the recombined DNA of individu­
als from two different species. Hybrid individuals receive their genetic material 
through the fertilization, whether natural or artificial, of an egg from one spe­
cies by the sperm of another. That genetic material then combines and is uni­
form throughout the hybrid organism . . . In contrast with hybrids, transgenic 
organisms may be intraspecies or interspecies. Transgenic organisms are created 
when a gene or specific piece of DNA from one animal is inserted into the DNA 
of another. Chimeras differ from both hybrids and transgenic organisms in that 
they exhibit at least two sets of genetically distinct cells. In other words, not all 
individual cells of a chimeric organism contain the same DNA.3
Examples might help. As I will be using the terms, a mule or a liger is a 
hybrid, the Chimpy would be a transgenic animal, and a monkey embryo 
with transplanted human pluripotent stem cells would be a chimera. Each 
of these categories is capable of generating morally troubling questions 
and those questions are rapidly becoming science fact rather than fiction.
The April 2021 issue of Nature featured the troubling headline, "First 
Monkey-­Human Embryos Reignite Debate over Hybrid Animals."4 Why 
"reignite"? Because scientists have already grown cow, rat, and pig 
embryos containing human cells, that is to say, chimeras. As a 2005 arti­
cle noted, "[S]cientists have tailored mice and other animals with human 
kidneys, blood, skin, muscles and various other components. Baboon 
and chimp hearts have been transplanted into human chest cavities, pig 
cells into the brains of Parkinson's disease patients and, more routinely, 
pig heart valves into people with heart disease, including Jesse Helms, 
the late U.S. senator."5
Our research has gone beyond chimeras. We have created numerous 
transgenic entities containing human DNA, ranging from the Onco­
mouse used to test cancer susceptibility to mice or sheep designed to 
produce human antibodies. Transgenic goats have been genetically engi­
neered to produce antithrombin, the human anti-­clotting agent, in their 
milk. Indeed, transgenic entities, with or without human genes, have 
become "a mainstay of the biomedical and basic science research land­
scape."6 The familiarity of hybrids such as the mule makes them seem 
the least worrying of the three, but what if the Chimpy were capable of 
naturally reproducing with humans, producing human-­Chimpy hybrids?

How would we treat the offspring? To repeat, all of these categories are 
capable of making us worry about the line. For brevity I will use the term 
"chimeras" in the discussion below but, unless otherwise indicated, the 
arguments developed also apply to human-­nonhuman transgenic species 
and hybrids.
The debate here will be very different than the debate over AI. It 
already is. For one thing, there is far more discussion about whether 
research into human-­nonhuman transgenic entities or hybrids should 
be completely banned than there is about advanced Artificial Intelli­
gence, though recent concerns about AI may have altered that tendency. 
If I had to bet which of my hypotheticals, Hal or the Chimpy, is likely to 
see the light of day, my money would be firmly on Hal. To be sure, there 
are deep concerns about AI, but they center around whether our cre­
ations will destroy us, or whether they should be more tightly regulated 
because of their possible effects on employment, privacy, and inscru­
table decision-­making. We do not ask, as we do in the debate over chime­
ras, whether those entities might somehow violate a moral norm merely 
by existing.
The basic division in our thinking about the line is a simple one that 
I have already touched upon. Does the special moral status that humans 
possess come from our membership of the species homo sapiens? In other 
words, is it a genetic moral birthright? Alternatively, does that status 
spring from the mental and other capacities that humans have? The first 
would focus on all of those who are human, defined perhaps by geno­
type, by the presence or absence of human cells, or even by phenotype, 
in this case, by physical appearance. The second would focus instead on 
all those who possess the cognitive capacities we settle on as being the rel­
evant ones, regardless of the shape of the metal casing or genetic setting 
in which those qualities are found. The implications of both positions for 
the debate over personhood are obvious. I mentioned earlier the reaction 
of a group of distinguished federal judges to a draft version of the Hal and 
Chimpy chapter. "But they aren't human," was one response, "rights are 
for humans." That would be the species-­based approach in all its glory. 
To be fair, the judges may have been giving the answer they thought the 
legal system required, not one grounded in moral philosophy. They are, 
after all, judges. I will return to this point later.

CHAPTER 5
When we talk about Artificial Intelligence the discussion is, as it has 
to be, entirely based on capacity. Does this new artificial entity have the 
mental and other capacities that require us to grant it an enhanced moral 
status and perhaps even to treat it as a person? To be sure there is much 
disagreement over what the relevant capacities are and how we could 
tell if they had been achieved, but no one is under the illusion that Hal 
belongs to the human species. In the case of chimeras, hybrids, and trans­
genic entities, by contrast, the notion of species defines the starting point 
of the popular—­though not the philosophical—­debate. That is so even 
though many bioethicists argue that species membership by itself is as 
morally irrelevant as one's sex or race. Later I will discuss whether they 
are right.
It seems clear that scientific research will continue to generate debates 
both about whether a particular entity should be forbidden or tightly 
regulated and about which entities, were they to be created, should have 
an elevated moral status and perhaps even a claim to personhood. It 
is worth stressing that these debates can generate profoundly different 
types of responses, even though each claims to be delineating the line 
of humanity. One sees it as a wall: "Danger! Do not cross." The other 
focuses on the placement of the gateway to greater moral recognition. 
They use the same language: "But would it be human?" Yet the nature 
of the question is profoundly different. In both cases, I think the initial 
popular response will be built around the question, "Is it, or would it be, 
too close to human?" Certainly that question has dominated the popular 
and political discussion so far. But what do we mean by it? After looking 
at multiple prior discussions and controversies, I did not find a single 
answer. Rather, there were at least five. I will summarize them here. If one 
needs a catchy mnemonic, one could call them percentage, provenance, 
procreation, portrayal, and potential. Each of them has significant prob­
lems but, if I am right about their political attractions, they presage a 
public debate very different from the one that philosophers might have 
in mind.
1.	 Percentage: it is human, or transgresses the species boundary, if it 
is highly genetically similar to us, measured by the DNA percent­
age match of a comparative genomics analysis. My fictional Chimpy

would be a poster child for this approach. However, it has problems. 
The first problem is that we are already genetically very similar to a 
huge range of animals, and plants for that matter. We are told that we 
have a 98 percent genetic similarity to an ape or, more woundingly, a 
75 percent similarity to a pumpkin, facts that would immediately be 
marshalled by anyone seeking to justify the creation of an entity like 
my fictional Chimpy. Perhaps it is the extent of human self-­conceit, 
or perhaps it is the poverty of the similarity revealed by the measure­
ment, but high percentages of genetic similarity do not cause us to see 
either chimpanzees or pumpkins as human. (Interestingly, and this 
supports the capacity-­based approach, it was the story of Tommy's 
mental capacities, not the similarity of his DNA, that got at least one 
judge to be moved by the habeas petition brought on his behalf.) More 
importantly, these percentages are largely meaningless when it comes 
to answering the questions we really care about in this instance. The 
comparative genomics numbers do not really tell us much about the 
functional genomic results. Genetic differences that sound small in per­
centage terms can have enormous functional effects. The method by 
which "similarity" is measured is blind to that type of difference, being 
based on "a structural, rather than a functional gene concept, thus 
rendering many of the implications drawn from comparative genomic 
studies largely unwarranted, if not completely mistaken."7 Compara­
tive genomics will not offer the kind of crisp answers the seductively 
precise percentages suggest. Its rhetorical significance, however, may 
be considerable.
2.	 Provenance: it is human, or transgresses on humanity, if some of its 
cells or DNA were originally taken from humans. This could be because 
we think that we are adding cells to an animal that somehow carry 
with them the "essence of humanity," such as brain cells or gonads. 
That seemed to be one factor in the public reaction to Weissman's 
proposed human-­neuron mouse. Alternatively, it could be because we 
think that it is disrespectful to mingle human biological material with 
that of nonhuman animals, as we do if human remains are handled 
in an undignified manner. Notice how very different the line-­drawing 
driven by the "desecration" concern is from the kind of line-­drawing 
we were considering in discussing Hal or even Tommy.

CHAPTER 5
3.	 Procreation: it is human, or transgresses on humanity, if it began 
life as a human embryo or is capable of reproducing with "natural" 
humans. The former criterion is the one the federal judges I spoke 
with had in mind. The issue is highlighted by the recent overturning 
of Roe v. Wade. How remote from an embryo does the entity have to 
be? What about pluripotent stem cells derived from an aborted fetus? 
A fetus that spontaneously miscarried? A nonviable embryo that is 
the result of a fertility procedure? Here the goal may simply be to pre­
vent the usage of cells that once came from embryos, regardless of 
the consent of the parents, whether the fetus is available because of 
an abortion or miscarriage or whether the research is done on a cell 
line that is temporally and scientifically far removed from its source. 
(Interestingly, the same objections are not raised for the use of cell 
lines derived from deceased individuals whose family agreed, post­
mortem, that their remains could be used for research.) The second 
possible criterion, the ability to interbreed, is in fact one definition of 
species: animals that are capable of interbreeding and producing off­
spring that are themselves also capable of reproduction are members 
of the same species. The procreation concern could be either that the 
ability to reproduce definitionally demonstrates species membership, 
and thus entitlement to legal personhood, or that an entity that could 
interbreed with humans was somehow threatening or sullying "nat­
ural" humanity itself. To quote Norman Fost, who worked on stem 
cell research policies for the National Academy of Sciences, "Literally 
nobody wants to see an experiment where two mice that have eggs 
and sperm of human origin have the opportunity to mate and produce 
human offspring. . . . That's beyond anybody's wildest nightmare."8 
(I encountered the children's book Stuart Little late in life. I found the 
matter-­of-­fact reaction Stuart's parents have to giving birth to a mouse 
both oddly uplifting and deeply weird.)
4.	Portrayal: it is human, or transgresses on humanity, if it looks like 
us, if it is made in our image. William Hurlbut, a member of the Presi­
dent's Council on Bioethics in George W. Bush's administration, put 
it this way: "Human appearance is something we should reserve for 
humans. Anything else that looks human debases the coinage of

truth."9 You could also call this the anti-­idolatry principle. Here the 
clash is between the involuntary response to visual clues—­it looks 
human!—­and what we know to be the biological reality. It could be 
linked to the notion that humans are made in God's image and that 
shape should not be profaned. It could also be rooted in secular con­
cerns that such hybrids will gradually desensitize and depersonalize 
us to actual human beings. Think of the reaction to extremely realis­
tic, electronic sex dolls. This response can be triggered even if only a 
fragment of an animal looks like a human being, as was shown by the 
reaction to the Vacanti Mouse, a mouse that had cartilage in the shape 
of a human ear implanted on its back.10 My own guess is that it also 
has something to do with unconscious norm-­signaling. Rightly or 
wrongly, we are picking up a cavalier attitude toward deeply embed­
ded, species-­policing cultural norms in a way that makes us mark 
the person who throws the line into question as an untrustworthy 
member of our tribe. Think of the depth of our revulsion toward 
other species-­connected transgressions, such as bestiality. Some have 
described the portrayal concerns as irrational. Does this not smack 
of some superstitious elevation of the human image, merely another 
form of unreflective speciesism? Other sober commentators, however, 
have highlighted its importance, perhaps out of fears of a public back­
lash that would threaten scientific funding: "In addition to concerns 
about human brain functions and human gametes, giving nonhuman 
animals, in whole or in the part, the outward physical appearance of 
humans, could be deeply unsettling. Whether that is a moral argu­
ment or prudential one, such experiments should be undertaken, if at 
all, only for the most powerful reasons."11
5.	 Potential: it is human, or transgresses on humanity, if it has the poten­
tial to possess high-­level human mental capacities. This concern, too, 
was clearly implicated by Weissman's proposed human-­neuron mouse. 
It is also the only one that many bioethicists find morally compel­
ling. Under this approach we do not identify something as human, 
or as a threat to a species line we wish to defend, because it has a 
high percentage of human DNA, contains biological material taken 
from human beings, has the ability to interbreed, or even looks like a

CHAPTER 5
human. Instead, we abstract from human beings the capacities that we 
believe give them some special moral status; for example, conceptual 
thought, language, the potential to choose moral alternatives and life 
plans. If an entity has, or would have, some of these capacities, we 
wonder whether it deserves the same kind of moral status as human 
beings. This potential-­based or capacity-­based approach is closest to 
the ones discussed in chapter 2. If one adopted this approach, one 
could apply the same criteria to Hal, the Chimpy, and even the neuron 
mouse in assessing their cases.
The controversy over Weissman's proposed mouse experiment pro­
vides good illustrations of many of these reactions. What exactly was 
Weissman thinking of doing? Greely and his colleagues write:
The most interesting experiment would begin with an inbred strain of mouse 
that begins to form brains during very early fetal development, but, several 
days before birth, died as a result of the death of most or all of the develop­
ing neurons in their brains (the glial cells that make up approximately 90% of 
the brain are unharmed). Weissman proposed to transplant human brain stem 
cells into the fetal mice, just before their own neurons died. His hope was to 
produce a living mouse with a functioning brain made up of mouse glial cells 
and human-­derived neurons. This mouse could then be used to study human 
neurons in vivo in a laboratory animal, similar to the way the severe combined 
immunodeficiency (SCID)-­hu mouse, which Weissman had helped developed 
in the late 1980s, allowed the study of the human immune system inside labo­
ratory mice.12
The use of human stem cells in medical research had already attracted 
controversy because some of those cell lines were originally derived from 
aborted fetuses. This particular proposal, however, added a significant 
additional element. The sci-­fi eeriness of experiments such as a mouse 
with human brain cells triggers the reaction that a boundary is being 
crossed in illegitimate ways. At least Frankenstein's monster was made 
exclusively of human body parts! Legislative proposals were not slow in 
coming. Senator Sam Brownback introduced a bill, S. 1373, that at times 
sounds rather like the Ghostbusters script ("Human sacrifice! Cats and 
dogs living together. Mass hysteria!"):
Congress finds that—­
(1)	 advances in research and technology have made possible the creation of 
chimeras, which are beings with diverse human and nonhuman tissue;

203
(2)	 serious ethical objections are raised to some types of chimeras because they 
blur the lines between human and animal, male and female, parent and 
child, and one individual and another individual;
(3)	 respect for human dignity and the integrity of the human species may be 
threatened by chimeras;
(4)	the uniqueness of individual human beings is manifested in a particular way 
through their brain and their reproductive organs/cells.13
Congressional findings have many roles. In part, they are used by legis­
lative drafters to preview for potential signatories the way the issue might 
play positively to their constituents and donors, the statutory equivalent 
of elevator pitches. They also provide guidance to courts and administra­
tive agencies should the measure be adopted. Both roles are represented 
here, but particularly the first one. It is worth noting that the identified 
issue is the improper mingling of "diverse human and nonhuman tissue" 
to create new "beings," the provenance issue. As for the reasons why it is 
a problem, the first listed finding is the blurring of the species line, closely 
followed by the threat to human dignity and the integrity of the species. 
Brownback even threw in the blurring of gender and familial lines for 
good measure, recalling Ghostbusters once more: "Men and women, cats 
and dogs." He was not alone in opposing chimeras. Bush devoted a line 
in his 2006 State of the Union address to supporting a ban on "creating 
human-­animal hybrids."14 Technically, they were chimeras, not hybrids, 
but one has to agree with the speechwriters that biological precision 
needed to take a backseat here.
One difficulty with these proposals is that, as I detailed earlier, the 
genetically engineered centaur has long since left the barn. Various kinds 
of chimeras and transgenic entities are already a central test bed for medi­
cal science. The Oncomouse that I mentioned earlier is only one exam­
ple. It is a transgenic mouse genetically engineered to develop cancers 
common in humans, and the first patented mammal.15 (The patent has 
expired. The trademark over "OncoMouse" is still valid.)
The Oncomouse was not even the first transgenic mouse created by 
cancer researchers, and it dates back to the 1980s. In the years since, 
mice models, both transgenic entities and chimeras, have become stan­
dard parts of the scientific researchers' toolkit. So have chimeras involv­
ing other nonhuman animals. They meet an obvious and pressing need; 
much of the research performed on them would be illegal and unethical

CHAPTER 5
if performed on humans. Some of that research is lifesaving or extend­
ing. True, there are other alternatives to research on human subjects. 
Researchers can assess diseases and drugs in vitro, observing chemical 
interactions in test tubes; in vivo, in unmodified nonhuman animals 
whose biochemistries are thought to be similar to humans; and in silico, 
in computer simulations. But each of these methods falls short. Genetic 
engineering allows scientists to get one huge step closer to studying how 
a drug or a disease would affect a human being by taking a mouse or 
any other animal and making it, in important respects, biologically more 
similar to a human. Let me stress that point. The reason that it seems as if 
we are playing with the species line is because we are. For scientists, that 
is not a bug but a vital, and possibly lifesaving, feature.
There is a fairly obvious disconnect between popular disquiet at chi­
meras and transgenic human-­animal creatures and the reaction of scien­
tists for whom they are a normal and necessary part of medical research. 
In some cases, scientists have seemed surprised by the intensity of the 
response and the fact that there is so little popular awareness about this 
kind of research. Indeed, Greely's report on the bioethics of the mouse 
experiments explicitly mentioned "risks to the public support of sci­
ence" as one of the dangers of experiments such as these: "We identified 
five areas of concern that need to be examined and, if found significant, 
weighed against the potential benefits. These concerns include: 1) the 
sources of the human brain stem cells; 2) the potential for pain and suffer­
ing to the mice; 3) the propriety of this use of human tissues (particularly 
brain tissues); 4) the risks of possibly conferring some degree of human­
ity on another species; and 5) the risks to public support of science."16 In 
other words, one of the risks to be considered is that experiments with a 
high "yuck" or "say what?" factor might actually lead to sweeping regu­
lations that would restrict beneficial scientific research. Scientists who 
share that perception can be expected to self-­regulate either by not per­
forming such experiments—­the course of action Weissman chose—­or by 
attempting to reduce their public visibility. When those experiments do 
become visible, attention will turn to what bioethicists and philosophers 
have to tell us about the issue. We will find that the academic view differs 
quite substantially from the popular reaction.

THE VIEW FROM ETHICAL SCHOLARSHIP
There is an impressive amount of philosophical and ethical scholar­
ship on the subject of this chapter, with chimeras and transgenic species 
receiving the most attention. I am not going to give a full review of that 
scholarship here, though I have profited from it, and there are further ref­
erences online at this book's website. Instead, I want to outline the deep 
structure of the debate, one that reveals a lot about our "thoughtways," 
the culturally salient patterns of moral and empathic reflection that we 
have available to us. My claim is not that our bioethicists, regulators, or 
even our cultural norms will come to a particular conclusion. Rather, I 
want to show the often-­invisible walls and paths that guide our thoughts 
on the subject. Those walls and paths are not culturally or historically 
invariant. They have changed and can change further. However, in the 
short and medium term, they will shape the debates of the future as they 
have shaped the debates of the past.
Moral philosophers are not always focused on exactly the same issues 
I am, nor do they always use the same terminology, but we are clearly 
dealing with the same territory of thought. With some significant excep­
tions,17 they tend to focus on the questions, "Who or what must be 
accorded 'human dignity'18 or 'full moral status?'19 And why?" This for­
mulation makes clear that we are not talking about the issues of admin­
istrative convenience and economic efficiency I discussed in the context 
of corporate personality, even though those may seep in at the margins. 
The inquiry is, appropriately enough, a moral one and sometimes, as we 
will see, an empathic one too.
How do we talk about such a topic? How do we think about it? Our 
moral thought oscillates between the poles of intuition and theory. For 
the former, we—­whether as ordinary people figuring out the right course 
of action or as bioethicists confronting an institutional moral dilemma—­
consult our moral intuitions. Does this seem right to me, and would it 
seem right to an average member of my community? For the latter, we 
proceed from some set of moral axioms, arranged in a logical structure, 
whether it be utilitarian, Kantian, or rights based. The fun happens when 
intuition and logic conflict. Think of the person who was brought up to 
believe that eating the meat of nonhuman animals is "natural" and good,

CHAPTER 5
but who reads the ethicist Peter Singer and then concludes that it is mor­
ally wrong. In that situation, normally, cool theoretical reason trumps 
intuition and community belief. Is that not why we do moral philoso­
phy? So that we are ruled by reasoned moral argument rather than gut 
feeling and social custom?
Occasionally, however, the pattern is reversed. The community norm 
or moral intuition is so strong and so widely held that, even if our theo­
ries are unable to account for it or fully explain it, we grant it primacy 
and reject the cold logic of moral theory. The intuition can be cloaked 
in the language of revulsion against "unnatural activities," used as the 
vehicle for a secularized version of a religious morality, or given authority 
simply because the emotional intensity of the reaction makes it existen­
tially irresistible, even if of mysterious provenance. Moral philosophers 
have mused on this point: "There seem to be clear examples of wrong 
actions where the only explanation of their wrongness appears to be that 
they are unnatural. Bestiality and pedophilia are wrong even when they 
cause no physical or psychological harm.  .  .  . Proponents of the yuck 
factor argue that the revulsion some people experience in contemplat­
ing certain activities sometimes suffices for knowing that the activity 
is wrong, even in the absence of satisfactory justification for the revul­
sion."20 Sometimes these defenses of intuition raise their own concerns. 
Pedophilia is a bizarre example to use since it involves a sexual act forced 
on a human being who, as the author notes, is definitionally incapable of 
giving consent. Is it not therefore obviously a sexual assault? To suggest 
it can occur without physical or psychological harm is more disturbing 
still. Surely reason supplies ample basis for finding the act evil without 
the need to turn to the horror and revulsion we also feel? Still, I would 
happily concede that there are activities toward which we feel a revulsion 
that is hard to explain but where we nevertheless feel confident in declar­
ing the activity immoral.
Perhaps we choose to give primacy to our intuitions about which 
activities are wrong or "unnatural" because we think our folkways con­
tain wisdom that goes beyond the "thin gruel" of our philosophies. 
Leon Kass coined the phrase "wisdom of repugnance" to describe this 
concept.21 Perhaps we believe that our intuitions express norms whose 
proven social evolutionary advantage is not to be sniffed at.22 Perhaps

we rely on our intuitions because we are reveling in our bigotry. Per­
haps we do it because we have seen brilliant people tangled in a web 
of words, sacrificing common sense and human sentiment to some arid 
set of theoretical postulates.23 Perhaps our conditioning is too strong for 
us to be fully rational. Perhaps we look at prior, supposedly scientific or 
supremely logical worldviews and see them leading their proponents to 
evil ends, whether in the name of eugenics, or scientific socialism, or 
Raskolnikov's hubristically murderous delusions in Dostoyevsky's Crime 
and Punishment.
Whatever the specific formulation, the tension between intuition and 
theory drives the enterprise. It is its motive spring. Nowhere is this pattern 
more evident than in the bioethical discussion of the deliberate creation 
of transgenic entities, chimeras, and hybrids. It does not merely structure 
the debate. It is the debate. Ethicists assail each other with commendable 
enthusiasm, albeit in relatively predictable patterns, for claimed errors on 
either side.
Do you assert that human dignity, or full moral status, springs from 
mere membership in the species, as in the popular responses I just dis­
cussed? You may find yourself being accused of indifference to the plight 
of Gregor Samsa: "Turn any so-­called speciesist into a large, cogitating 
bug, and he will no doubt think it morally impermissible for his family 
to call the exterminator."24 Alternatively, you may be reminded of the 
uncomfortable similarity between speciesism and more obviously evil 
practices: "Just as with racism and sexism, speciesism extracts a norma­
tive conclusion (humans have more moral worth than all other creatures) 
from an arbitrarily chosen morally insignificant fact."25
The answer, of course, is to rest human dignity or the special moral 
worth of humans on their unique capacities, not their DNA or their phys­
ical appearance. Let us say those capacities include high-­level abstract 
thought, the capability to form moral assessments and autonomous life 
projects involving them, and the use of complex symbols to engage in 
communication with others, both synchronically and over time in the 
formation of a rich and varied culture. There are many human beings who 
do not possess some or all of those capacities. Some of them lack them at 
a particular moment in time—­a newborn, a person in a temporary coma. 
Others will never have them—­an anencephalic baby who lacks much of

CHAPTER 5
a normal human brain. If the special moral status of humans depends on 
their capacities rather than on simple membership of the species, can it 
be the case that the anencephalic child is somehow not fully human in 
the moral sense? May we deny her the moral worth accorded to a human 
of full mental capacity? Our intuitions cry out that this is, literally, inhu­
man. Yet is that the implication of our moral theories?
There are bioethicists who are willing to ride the theory train to its 
Huxleyan last stop, to say that the anencephalic child is not entitled to 
full human dignity and moral status, though we should refrain from 
cruelty.26 Most, however, try to find some way of leaping from the train 
before that awful terminus. They combine the two approaches, arguing 
that all humans deserve their moral status because most humans have 
those mental capacities, so that even those who lack them are neverthe­
less inside the line, provided that they are genetically human. Yet the 
objection recurs. If the moral status of the species depends on a series 
of cognitive abilities, why does membership of the species, something 
that one insightful ethicist I quoted earlier called "an arbitrarily chosen, 
morally insignificant fact," confer this status on those who very clearly 
do not have those abilities? One answer is to turn to the difficulty of line-­
drawing: "[T]here is no clear agreement about just how many dignity-­
associated capacities a person must possess to be said to have human 
dignity. To avoid the possibility of mistakenly failing to treat those with 
severe disabilities as ends in themselves, human dignity proponents 
ascribe dignity to all humans."27 The nonacademic reader may wonder 
why philosophers have to work so hard in order to conclude that we 
should treat all humans as . . . humans. Does this mark the fact that the 
ethicists have seen more deeply, realizing that speciesism, this focus on 
a "morally insignificant fact," is no more respectable than racism or sex­
ism? Or does the intuition that being human matters perhaps capture 
something deeper than mere in-­group prejudice?
THE MORAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SPECIES BOUNDARIES
How does all of this play out in the debate over transgenic entities, human-
nonhuman chimeras, or hybrids? Two obvious questions present them­
selves. Is it morally wrong to create all or some types of human-nonhuman

chimeras and, if so, why? If it is not morally wrong, or we are dealing 
with a fait accompli, then what moral status would those entities have?
The first question shows the importance of capacity-­based as opposed 
to species-­based moral reasoning. Many bioethicists have adopted the 
capacity-­based view, arguing that mere membership in the species or pos­
session of human DNA is morally irrelevant. But if that is true, what does 
it mean for chimeras? Does it mean that thinking it unnatural to cross 
species lines, or that we would be somehow sullying humanity if we did 
so, shows the same bigoted irrationality as saying that it is unnatural to 
allow racially mixed marriages or that we would be sullying one race by 
doing so? "Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, Malay 
and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the 
interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such mar­
riages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend 
for the races to mix."28 That quotation is from a court enforcing Virginia's 
anti-­miscegenation law in 1959. The judge went on to sentence a racially 
mixed couple to a year in jail for their crime, the sentence to be sus­
pended for 25 years contingent on them leaving Virginia. The odious law 
was struck down in 1967 by the perfectly named Supreme Court case of 
Loving v. Virginia. Chief Justice Earl Warren quoted that passage to show 
that the law was "obviously an endorsement of the doctrine of White 
Supremacy."29 Think of the similarly disapproving words I quoted earlier 
about speciesism: "Just as with racism and sexism, speciesism extracts a 
normative conclusion (humans have more moral worth than all other 
creatures) from an arbitrarily chosen morally insignificant fact."30 Will 
a latter-­day Warren opine that laws forbidding human-­nonhuman chi­
meras are "obviously an endorsement of the doctrine of human genetic 
superiority"? Or would he be convinced that "the fact that almighty God 
separated the species genetically shows that he did not intend for them 
to be mixed"?
If the species boundary, by itself, has no more moral weight than racial 
classifications, and if the appeal to divine command is of dubious author­
ity in a pluralistic society with a constitutional prohibition against the 
establishment of religion, then how can we explain or defend the deep 
revulsion many have against the notion of human-­nonhuman chimeras?

that mean that the creation of the chimera is morally problematic only 
in terms of its consequences? For example, would it be acceptable to cre­
ate an entity such as the Chimpy, with humanlike abilities, as long as 
we treated it as human? Does it also mean that our criteria for person­
hood need to ignore the percentage of human DNA and instead focus 
only on the capabilities revealed by the new entity, regardless of its 
genetic makeup?
An even more interesting issue is raised by flipping the question 
around. If genetic manipulation made it possible to give chimpanzees 
human-­level linguistic and reasoning abilities, together with the elevated 
moral status those abilities entitle them to, and if doing so enhanced their 
collective sense of well-­being, might there actually be a moral obligation 
to engage in "genetic uplift"?31 (The idea that greater capacities translate 
into a greater sense of well-­being will seem dubious on those days, such 
as the one on which I wrote these lines, when we are using those same 
abstract reasoning abilities to make ourselves exquisitely miserable.)
Faced with this deluge of hard questions, some might be feeling nos­
talgic for the more irrational certainties of speciesism.
There are various possible responses to these questions. One can privi­
lege intuition over theory, arguing that the intensity of the reaction 
against crossing species boundaries, sometimes called "the yuck factor," 
is moral warrant enough:
Some think that the yuck factor has been discredited because it has been used 
to rationalize discrimination. Racists claimed to "know simply by looking" that 
interracial marriages were wrong. But the fact that an argument has been used 
inappropriately in some areas does not mean that it is inappropriate in other 
areas. . . . Even opponents of the yuck factor must concede that, sometimes, we 
know that an action is wrong merely on the basis of our reaction to it, even if 
we cannot satisfactorily justify that reaction.32
One difficulty with this answer, of course, is that the opponents 
of women's suffrage, homosexuality, and transgender identities also 
thought those things were obviously wrong. They found ample proof of 
their rectitude in the sheer intensity of their feelings, "merely on the basis 
of [their] reaction to it, even if [they] cannot satisfactorily justify that 
reaction." Perhaps the case of the chimera is different, but the burden of 
proof is not met by saying "but this time it is really yucky!"

Intuitive revulsion is often linked to the claim that some practice is 
"unnatural"—­a deviation from some presumed correct, natural state of 
affairs. Sometimes the natural state of affairs is an imaginary world with­
out technology or, more often, without the particular technology with 
which one disagrees. For example, consider the argument that people 
do not have wings and thus powered flight is unnatural, a claim I then 
proselytize in a pamphlet produced on that miracle of distinctly non­
natural technology, a printing press. Sometimes "unnatural" is a code 
word for "makes me feel uneasy," in which case it is likely to show par­
ticularly close kinship with the yuck factor described above. Sometimes 
the natural state of affairs is the postulated world the deity, as the true 
author of nature, desires.33 To their great credit, the theistic versions of 
the naturalistic argument do not deny that this is, quite literally, a leap 
of faith.
The naturalistic fallacy can even be turned to environmental ends. The 
protagonist picks a particular environmental baseline to favor (e.g., large-­
scale dairy farming natural, GMO cattle-­feed unnatural) and deduces the 
fact that the disfavored "unnatural" intervention is therefore wrong. The 
coding is arbitrary: How do we feel about smallpox, cancer, or violent 
crime? Are vaccines, chemotherapy, and jails unnatural and thus wrong? 
When do we start the environmentally natural clock running: Pangaea? 
The Jurassic era? After deforestation and the Highland Clearances pro­
duced the "natural" landscape of the Scottish Highlands as we know it 
today? The way things were when you were growing up? But beyond the 
baseline problem, a stage in the argument is simply missing. That is the 
reason we call it the naturalistic fallacy—­a way of moving from a claimed 
"normal" set of facts to some moral conclusion without the troublesome 
intervening stage of logical argument.
There is a more substantial variant of the naturalistic argument: the 
environmental precautionary principle. We should not meddle with the 
natural, or at least current, state of affairs, particularly if we are using 
technologies such as genetic engineering that are capable of producing 
substantial disruption. The reason is not because a loving Goddess Gaia 
has told us of the natural sacredness of species boundaries but rather out 
of technological humility faced with an environment that is more com­
plex than we know. The ecosystem is both enormously complicated and

delicately fragile. We understand its multiple feedback loops, dependen­
cies, and equilibria poorly, if at all. Thus, to embark on major changes 
such as the creation of transgenic species or chimeras would be an act of 
unspeakable hubris, possibly producing disastrous consequences. Politi­
cians on both sides of the aisle are attentive to the appeal of this argu­
ment. Brownback's proposed legislation made the finding that "with an 
increase in emerging zoonotic infection threatening the public health, 
both domestically and abroad, chimeras present a particularly optimal 
means of genetic transfers that could increase the efficiency or virulence 
of diseases threatening both humans and animals."34 In the wake of 
COVID-­19, one can hardly wave these concerns away, but surely they 
sweep more broadly than human-­animal mixtures?
I have friends who are environmentalists and friends who are social 
conservatives, and I have always thought they shared more than they 
knew. (In this divisive world, it is probably too much to hope that the 
argumentative similarity might prompt thoughtful dialogue between the 
two communities.)
The social, or at least Burkean, conservative thinks of the social world 
in exactly the way many environmentalists feel about the natural one. 
Society is a fragile organism, poorly understood. Its institutions were not 
formed according to some strictly rational plan, and they fulfill functions 
of which we are unaware. To tinker with society's delicate machinery on 
the basis merely of the "delusive plausibilities of moral politicians" is an 
exercise of hubris and an invitation to disaster.35 Here are Burke's caution­
ary words, written just after the French Revolution:
An ignorant man, who is not fool enough to meddle with his clock, is however 
sufficiently confident to think he can safely take to pieces, and put together at 
his pleasure, a moral machine of another guise, importance and complexity, 
composed of far other wheels, and springs, and balances, and counteracting and 
co-­operating powers. Men little think how immorally they act in rashly med­
dling with what they do not understand. Their delusive good intention is no 
sort of excuse for their presumption. They who truly mean well must be fearful 
of acting ill.36
Note how similar this is to the environmentalist's critique of disastrous, 
hubristic interventions into our ecology, disrupting feedback loops we 
understand poorly in the delusional belief that our mental technological

maps adequately describe the ecological terrain. Both the environmental 
and the social version of this argument deserve serious consideration, 
but not unquestioning acquiescence. The argument proves too much; 
it has no limiting principle. We did not, and should not have, let slav­
ery or smallpox thrive because they had been traditional or endemic in 
our world. We should also be rightly skeptical of the fact that those who 
oppose genetically modified crops may not be those who desperately 
need to grow them in poor soil and unsurprised that those who claim tra­
ditional sex roles fulfill some vital function tend to be those who benefit 
from them. The core of the argument against hubris stands, however, and 
should produce humility in both the social and the industrial engineer 
confident that their interventions will have no unforeseen consequences 
in their respective systems.
How does the environmental precautionary principle fare when it 
comes to chimeras and transgenic species? The first thing to note is that 
the argument sweeps broadly. It fails to resonate specifically with the 
unique unease about human-­nonhuman organisms it would be used to 
justify. Why is this particular genetic modification more environmentally 
dangerous than any other, than genetically modified crops, say? Given 
the role of genetically modified crops in the Kansas economy, I think we 
can presume that Brownback's concern about species modification would 
come to a screeching halt when he hit corn. I do not make the comparison 
merely because genetically modified crops have been found to be safe by 
every scientific organization that has investigated them, though they can 
raise the danger of vulnerable monocultures. Instead, I use the compari­
son to show that the precautionary principle preaches a general forbear­
ance rather than counseling us to be particularly alarmed by the chimera. 
Fundamentally, the environmental precautionary principle suggests we 
be cautious about all genetic modifications. Perhaps the very idea that 
we can reengineer our own species is a mark of a vaunting genetic hubris 
that is likely to have environmental implications far beyond the species 
boundary. Perhaps it should be resisted for that reason, as a way to dem­
onstrate to the wider society just how untethered we have become from 
environmental caution. But in that case, the chimera is being resisted 
more for what it presages in our wider patterns of behavior than for what 
it itself brings about.

CHAPTER 5
One of the most influential ethical objections to chimeras is that their 
creation would blur the line between humans and nonhuman animals, 
producing inexorable moral confusion and perhaps undermining the 
special status that human beings grant themselves above nonhuman ani­
mals. The authors Jason Scott Robert and Francoise Baylis put the point 
this way.
Asking—­let alone answering—­a question about the moral status of part-­
human interspecies hybrids and chimeras threatens the social fabric in untold 
ways; countless social institutions, structures, and practices depend upon the 
moral distinction drawn between human and nonhuman animals. Therefore, 
to protect the privileged place of human animals in the hierarchy of being, 
it is of value to embrace (folk) essentialism about species identities and thus 
effectively trump scientific quibbles over species and over the species status of 
novel beings.37
Moral philosophers have been quite critical of this line of argument. 
They have pointed out that it is "always possible that a given instance 
of moral confusion marks a stage in the process of moral evolution."38 
After all, numerous scientific advances, from heliocentrism to the the­
ory of evolution, have threatened some degree of moral confusion: "To 
prevent scientific research on the grounds that it would force people to 
reexamine a particular moral view by demonstrating the falsity of its 
underlying factual assumptions would be to prevent not only scientific 
progress but moral progress as well."39 On a more basic level, many of the 
critics disagree with both the unique privileging of humans over non­
human animals and the idea that questioning such a categorical line is 
a bad idea.40
The blurring criticism of human-­nonhuman chimeras contains more 
than a hint of the Burkean social conservative arguments we looked at 
earlier. The threat is to the social fabric, to the moral order, to "count­
less social institutions, structures, and practices." Even though our folk 
categories and essentialist species lines may lack a fully rational basis, we 
should nevertheless embrace them to prevent further disorder. At times 
it is hard to tell to what extent the critics are engaged in description 
and prediction of how society will respond and to what extent they are 
engaged in prescription, offering a plausible objection against the cre­
ation of human-­nonhuman chimeras.

215
The prescriptive argument strikes me as weak. Panic about blurring 
binary categories is neither a new nor a reliable source of moral insight, 
as countless artists have reminded us and as the current debate over trans­
gender rights perfectly illustrates. "You've got your mother in a whirl / 
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl."41 Anti-­blurring arguments have 
been raised against everything from changes in sex roles to racial inter­
marriage. White supremacists did indeed foment moral panic about the 
prospect of light-­skinned African Americans who could pass as white, 
throwing the racial boundary line they held sacred into disorder. At the 
very least, this history should give us pause. It is worth noting that, in the 
essay that coined the useful and thought-­provoking term "the wisdom 
of repugnance," the author also cast a fond eye back to an earlier time: 
"Twenty-­five years ago, abortion was still largely illegal and thought to be 
immoral, the sexual revolution (made possible by the extramarital use of 
the pill) was still in its infancy, and few had yet heard about the reproductive 
rights of single women, homosexual men and lesbians."42 Really? In fact, a lot 
of people had not only "heard about" reproductive rights and gay rights 
but ardently fought for them. What the author seems to mean is actu­
ally "few people like me" had heard about or, more likely, could be made 
to care about, these issues. That does not exactly speak in favor of the 
wisdom of such a view. Repugnance may well function as a useful alarm, 
prompting us to probe the reasons for our reactions more thoroughly and 
to reflect more carefully on the morality of our action. I do not think that 
it alone can carry the argument to its conclusion.
Though the prescriptive side of the argument fails to convince me, 
the descriptive and predictive side of the argument strikes me as not just 
plausible but overwhelmingly likely given the kinds of popular responses 
I have discussed already. It is worth noting that Brownback's proposed 
legislation explicitly declared that "serious ethical objections are raised to 
some types of chimeras because they blur the lines between human and ani­
mal, male and female, parent and child, and one individual and another indi­
vidual." If presented with Robert and Baylis's argument that "asking—­let 
alone answering—­a question about the moral status of part-­human inter­
species hybrids and chimeras threatens the social fabric in untold ways," 
I think Brownback would have added a hearty, "Amen!"

CHAPTER 5
CAPACITY STARTS FROM SPECIES
The goal of the ethicists is both understandable and admirable. They 
want to move our moral status from resting on things that are arbitrary 
or morally insignificant—­I am British or American or white or a man or a 
human—­to a basis in something that bears a rational relationship to the 
claimed status, such as high-­level consciousness, abstract rationality, or 
autonomy within a future of imagined possible life worlds. Here is one 
influential list:
Human dignity is a widely shared notion that signifies that humans typically 
display certain sorts of functional and emergent capacities that render them uniquely 
valuable and worthy of respect. It is not only the capacities for reasoning, choos­
ing freely, and acting for moral reasons, as Kant argues, or for entertaining and 
acting on the basis of self-­chosen purposes, as Gewirth holds, that are at the 
core of what we mean by human dignity. The notion also encompasses such 
capacities as those for engaging in sophisticated forms of communication and 
language, participating in interweaving social relations, developing a secular 
or religious world view, and displaying sympathy and empathy in emotionally 
complex ways.43
At times, some of the bioethical literature sounds dismissive of those 
who believe that one has a special moral status simply by being human 
rather than for having the capacities that they believe set humans apart. 
The opposition is presented as being irrational or as basing its arguments 
on morally irrelevant facts. By comparison, the suggestion is that the 
capacity-­based view has achieved a level of lofty moral detachment, neu­
tral in its focus on our capabilities rather than focusing parochially on 
mere membership of a species. This argument is important and partly 
persuasive. It moves the debate forward. I think, however, that it has 
two generally unacknowledged weaknesses. The first goes to the ques­
tion of whether the list of capabilities is indeed species independent and 
thus completely different in kind from the species-­based argument. The 
second concerns a failure to understand the moral and legal history in 
which our current debate takes place, and in particular the role of univer­
sal human rights as an ethical and political touchstone.
Let us start with the list of capabilities above: reasoning, choosing 
freely, acting for moral reasons, sophisticated forms of language and cul­
ture, developing a secular or religious worldview, and so on. This does

217
indeed sound more neutral and independent than "Are you one of our 
DNA tribe?" but what rational relationship do those things bear to our 
moral status? The response would be that these are the things that make 
us us, that make us distinguishable from nonhuman animals, that give 
rise to the form of consciousness and moral autonomy that lies at the 
core of what it is to be a human being! This argumentative move is a par­
tial success. It offers us insights into the reason why we would be moved 
if Hal, or an intelligent space alien, could demonstrate similar qualities, 
though they had no basis in human DNA. Surely they both would be 
able to make moral claims on us, regardless of their genetic background? 
Nevertheless, the precise logical connection between the alleged cogni­
tive facts and the normative claims is still fuzzy, perhaps intractably so. 
This point has fueled a prolonged philosophical debate and much hand-­
waving in both Kantian and utilitarian philosophy,44 but the discussion 
has an even deeper limitation, one that is often unacknowledged.
The goal in all of this theorizing, remember, is to get away from the 
unreflective parochialism that simply bases the rights of the favored 
group on the fact that they are born members of the favored group, 
whether a race, a sex, or a species. In turning away from group member­
ship to cognitive capacity-­based accounts of human dignity, the idea is 
that we have escaped the inevitably parochial arguments that rest on the 
brute happenstance of the group into which we are born, to focus instead 
on universal, species-­transcending qualities. But have we fully escaped? 
Can we? Should we?
Imagine the moral philosophers of two civilizations from distant stars. 
The first, call them the Iq, are a biological species like us but, unlike the 
other organisms on their planet, they are fully telepathic. Whereas non-­Iq 
animals on their world have only a limited ability to feel the emotions of 
others—­thus falling back on various cries and gestures to communicate—­
the Iq can fluently communicate the most complex concepts, feelings, or 
artworks mind to mind.
The second civilization is made up of machine intelligences. Call them 
the Stygians. Their records show that their primitive "ancestor" machines 
were created by biological entities, but they have since evolved far, far 
beyond this crude beginning. They find the biological entities who created 
those early versions interesting, just as we are fascinated by our primitive

CHAPTER 5
evolutionary ancestors. But their biological forebears are viewed, at most, 
as a kind of primitive "loading-­program"45 for actual consciousness, a 
property solely possessed by the self-­evolving machine intelligences that 
followed. (The fate of their biological creators is not recorded.) Congratu­
lations Samuel Butler, your satire is now a documentary.
The philosophers and ethicists of these civilizations, the Iq and Sty­
gian equivalents of Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham, or Peter Singer, 
Daniel Dennett, Christine Korsgaard, and Matt Adler, are like us in one 
way. They seek to come up with the criteria that entitle them to their 
unique moral status. They reject, as many of our moral philosophers do, 
criteria resting on "arbitrarily chosen, morally insignificant facts," such 
as their possession of Iq genetic code or Stygian computer code. Instead, 
they look to reach beyond parochialism to rest their theorizing on the 
capabilities that ground their elevated moral status.
Their list of canonical, morally consequential capabilities might 
well overlap with ours; we should fervently hope that it does, for self-­
preservation if nothing else. Passing either group's Voight-­Kampff Test 
would be no joke. But can we doubt that those lists of criteria would be 
shaped, perhaps decisively, by the context of different factual abilities in 
which they arose?
Think of the telepathic Iq. Could telepathy fail to influence the list 
of morally relevant qualities, perhaps dramatically so? Would cogito, ergo 
sum, "I think, therefore I am," be replaced by "I hear others think, there­
fore I am"? How would moral philosophy be different in a world where 
the pain of others was immediately, viscerally, felt whether one wished 
it or not? How would we think of ethics itself where the prompts of the 
Golden Rule needed no articulation, where Smith's Theory of the Moral 
Sentiments would not be unlocking the mystery of empathy's relationship 
to morality but describing a psychological process apparent to any five 
year old? In that world, linguistic philosophy is the study of the rudi­
mentary communication methods of animals who are mind-­blind, and 
language is what one would look for in a primitive being, not a highly 
evolved one. Finding linguistic proficiency would surely be a demerit on 
the Iqian's consciousness exam. Our once vaunted last citadel, now fall­
ing under the chatbot's assault, might instead be the damning proof of 
our brutish lack of sentience.

The point transcends biology. What would intelligence look like to a 
set of machine entities capable of running millions of simulations a sec­
ond for any probability distribution or physical system, where the clos­
est equivalent of religious transcendence was the continued self-­directed 
evolution of machine beings toward some unknowable goal? Our own 
decidedly insentient phones can easily spit out the first 1,000 prime num­
bers or, as we shamefacedly cheat on a spelling game, all of the possible 
words formed from a random combination of letters. Computer intelli­
gences might think the ability to do these things the simplest, most basic 
test of rational thought—­the equivalent of 2 + 2 to us. Would either the 
Iq or the Stygians look on us and recognize moral kinship? Perhaps, but 
it strains credulity to imagine it.
My point is simply this. In philosophical terms, the move to a capacity-­
focused approach is a clear advance from species-­based thinking. Two 
cheers for our ethicists. We should not mistake that advance for the 
actual identification of some universal, species-­independent set of quali­
ties, however. That, it is not.
In chapter 4, I quoted de Waal, who seeks to cast doubt on the impor­
tance of human capacities such as complex language and abstract thought 
as compared to the very different approaches to survival taken by other 
species such as ants and termites.46 I pointed out that if you had told 
Aristotle that his argument was wrong because ants and termites have 
greater numbers and biomass, he would rightly think you were missing 
his point. The hive has no place for logos, ethos, nomos, and polis—­reason, 
ethics, law, and political community—­the structure of a human civiliza­
tion that Aristotle found to be rooted implicitly in our capacities for lan­
guage and abstract thought. These qualities matter to us partly because 
we are us. It is our species-­centric set of capabilities and perspectives that 
gives them significance.
In fact, de Waal is doing the same thing to the capacities of rational­
ity, advanced cognitive thought, and so on as the bioethicists are doing 
when they criticize the parochialism and irrelevance of a species-­based 
point of view rather than one based on the capacities of abstract thought. 
Each points out the contingency and potential moral irrelevance of the 
qualities that are being valorized by the groups below their chosen level of 
abstraction.

CHAPTER 5
To the person who believes we should focus on species rather than 
race, sex, or class, the human species is the correct level of abstraction. 
Human rights for all members of the species, regardless of their capaci­
ties! To the person who believes that speciesism is morally irrelevant, it 
is human capacities that are the relevant markers of moral worth. To de 
Waal, it is still too species-­bound to believe that the sophisticated cog­
nitive capacities humans have demonstrate our relative superiority and 
moral worth. We should look at still other, even more abstract categories 
such as survival strategy, numbers, and biomass. If those are the stakes, 
the worm, or at least the ant or termite, may literally be emperor of us all. 
Shakespeare is right once more. Yet the categories on which de Waal relies 
come straight from the highly abstract insights of evolutionary biology, 
something that the hive can exemplify but never identify, still less reflect 
upon. To be clear, I agree that the focus on rationality and advanced cog­
nitive capacities should help guide our ethical thought, and that those 
qualities partially transcend species or type of intelligence—­a huge point 
in their favor. Yet the vision of rationality and advanced cognitive capac­
ity that I come up with, the account of what those qualities require, will 
surely be very different from the vision that would be offered by the 
moral philosophers of a telepathic species, a hive mind, or a machine 
intelligence. Why? In part because those are our capacities, the capacities 
our species valorizes and—­from Aristotle through Kant and onward—­they 
make the center of our logos, ethos, nomos, and polis.
Let me stress the point. There is no escape to a species-­neutral point of 
view, though we may see certain lines on the continuum as better or worse. 
As we try to determine both the facts and the ethos of the divide between 
humans and other animals—­and now between humans and transgenic 
species, chimeras, and hybrids, between us and our AI future—­we still 
start, as we must start, from within our very human perspective.
Even when we reject speciesism, our theories are still shaped, perhaps 
decisively so, by the factual abilities our species has and thus values. 
When we seek to apply those theories to the strange Others the future 
will bring, some of whom may have consequential abilities we do not 
share, that thought should prompt a strange mixture of humility and 
confidence: "I acknowledge that the foundations on which I stand are 
shaky, but here I stand nevertheless because I must, and perhaps should,

do so. Yet, given new information and argument, I am willing to reexam­
ine my assumptions."
JUSTIFYING SPECIES-­BASED DISTINCTIONS?
When ethicists justify species-­based arguments, some put forward an 
argument something like this: all humans deserve human rights because 
most humans have, will have, or once had advanced cognitive capaci­
ties that serve as a moral warrant for different treatment than nonhu­
man animals. Why not confine the moral privilege to those who have 
those capacities, though? For many, the answer is the difficulties of line-­
drawing. Stated that way, the argument seems, at best, lukewarm. The 
anencephalic kid gets inside the line only because it is too hard to draw 
the line excluding her? That's it? At the end of the day, this argument 
alone does not satisfy me. Nevertheless, to be fair, first let us try and flesh 
it out more thoroughly. Can the argument be improved? Try this thought 
experiment.
Transplant the objection to species-­based arguments to the world of 
voter qualifications. We all probably agree that the right to vote at a par­
ticular age has its moral basis in the presumptive acquisition of a series 
of capacities that comes with age: knowledge about the world, a certain 
level of maturity, some degree of political awareness, acculturation in our 
society, and so on. We would also probably acknowledge, if pressed, that 
some have those qualities in full measure by the time they are 14 while 
others lack them even when they are 30; indeed they may always lack 
them. Should we therefore exclaim in outrage that the "arbitrarily cho­
sen, morally insignificant fact" of orbiting the sun 18 times is the key to 
full legal personhood, including the right to vote? True, you could say the 
reason one deserves the full suite of legal rights is partly based on the fact 
that at 18 one also is subject to the full suite of social duties, including 
the duty to serve in the armed forces of one's country. But this merely 
pushes the analysis back one stage. Those duties, too, are keyed to a mor­
ally irrelevant calendar age. Again, that calendar age at best represents a 
median point on the bell curve of the acquisition of the capabilities on 
which such duties should be based. Is it not monstrously unjust that both 
the right to vote and the duty to serve should be keyed to this morally

CHAPTER 5
irrelevant fact rather than the capabilities for which that fact is at best a 
very rough proxy?
The answer of course, is, "No, and why are you getting so upset?" 
Having 18 as the franchise age requirement seems to be a more mor­
ally arbitrary line than believing in rights for all members of our spe­
cies, regardless of their capabilities. Yet it arouses no unease. Why the 
difference in response? Is this just the point that line-­drawing is hard, 
that "there is no clear agreement about just how many dignity-­associated 
capacities a person must possess to be said to have human dignity"?47 
Partly, but not entirely.
Moral norms have multiple dimensions and one of those dimensions 
is the acknowledgment of pluralism—­that reasonable people have sub­
stantial disagreements on matters of value and of norm application. We 
might disagree about whether a particular 18 year old is mature enough 
to vote or whether the anencephalic child meets some moral philoso­
pher's checklist of cognitive capacities. We can agree, however, on their 
respective ages and human status.
We could go still further. Acknowledgment of pluralism is not merely 
a justification for drawing bright, clear lines, even if some will think 
them over-­ or under-­inclusive. It offers clues to substantive values as well 
as administrative ones. We do not think of democratic pluralism as a 
grudging second-­best solution because line-­drawing problems preclude 
the first-­best option: the rule of a wise philosopher-­king. In a pluralistic 
world, democracy for a republic of sovereign citizens is an independent 
substantive value, not just a method for handling disagreement admin­
istratively. Might the same not be said for the idea of human rights for 
all humans?
One of the things that we try to teach in law schools is this: A decision-­
making system does not get to choose to make no mistakes. That's not 
an option. But it can choose where to make those mistakes because error 
costs may not be symmetrical and thus the choice of error domain may 
be hugely consequential. The presumption of innocence and the "beyond 
a reasonable doubt" standard for conviction in criminal trials are such 
choices. We choose to make our errors in one realm—­letting some who 
are guilty go free—­in the hope that we will keep from making the worse

error of imprisoning or executing the innocent. Even there, tragically, we 
still make mistakes.
This is not merely an administrative point. A moral criterion that pro­
duces fewer of the mistakes we most want to avoid is a better and more 
just moral criterion, not just a more easily administered one. The error 
we want most fervently to avoid is surely that of wrongfully denying a 
human being their rights, their moral worth.
I think this is a much stronger defense of speciesism than the mere 
invocation of line-­drawing problems with nothing more. Yet even this 
more robust defense fails to capture public intuition, which is not regret­
ful speciesism, speciesism as a second-­best, or even speciesism as a device 
to optimize asymmetric error costs and accommodate moral pluralism. 
Instead, it is speciesism as a proud moral principle—­"Human rights for all 
humans!" Is this simple error, prejudice, and bigotry?
MORALLY IRRELEVANT FACTS
Majority popular sentiment does not agree with bioethicists in seeing the 
species-­based argument as appealing to morally irrelevant facts. Earlier 
I gave as an example a list of such facts: I should not have some special 
moral status because I am British or American or white or a man or a 
human. Many people would agree with that statement all the way until 
"human," at which point they want to get off the train. Why?
For many in our society, the answer will be a religious one, with 
humanity being the gift of a benign deity to every member of our species, 
no matter how afflicted they might be. For others, the analogy might be 
to family membership. Is it wrong for me to prefer my child's interests 
to a stranger's? Is family membership not a morally irrelevant fact? Some 
ethicists and effective altruists would say that it is. I doubt that affects 
their behavior as parents, except perhaps at the margin. We do not cast 
all kinship ties aside as irrational, bigoted, or unjust. The philosopher 
Bernard Williams famously observed that a man who wonders whether 
he should save his wife or an unknown stranger from a burning building 
has "had one thought too many."48 Is humanity itself analogous to such 
kinship? For Williams, ethics was too complex, too fractal, too wound

up in the quotidian experience of our lives to be reduced to tidy formu­
lae. For him, in the words of one insightful summation, "the standard 
of 'what makes life meaningful' is always deeper and more genuinely 
explanatory than the canon of moral obligation."49 That rings true. As 
you may have guessed from the decidedly nonformulaic structure and 
content of this book, I am a member, or at least an intermittent fan, of 
Team Williams. When I find myself struggling under the influence of 
abstract capacity-­based ethical theories to justify the moral claims of an 
anencephalic child, I do indeed feel as though I am having one thought 
too many.
For me, there is a clearer way to explain the allure of a moral commit­
ment to counting all members of our species, regardless of their capaci­
ties, as fully human. It lies in the moral lessons taught by the history of 
the struggle for universal human rights. There is broad consensus that 
people should not have special rights due to their race or sex. It is pre­
cisely in opposition to such parochial categories that we deploy the idea 
of human rights. The bad old categories are displaced by the apparent uni­
versality of the notion of rights that apply to all humans because they are 
members of the human species and nothing more.
This, many thought, was the glorious summit of moral progress, defi­
antly sweeping away the indefensibly limited categories and replacing 
them with the ultimate in universality. Finally, a global conception of 
human rights that applies to humans, to every member of the species, 
regardless of race, sex, wealth, or nationality, but also regardless of age, 
degree of mental function, or disability! That was the importance of 
mere species membership being sufficient. It made irrelevant old claims 
about the cognitive superiority of particular races or sexes. It decisively 
rejected eugenics, whether in the form of Oliver Wendell Holmes's infa­
mous line that "three generations of imbeciles is enough"50 or in the form 
of the Nazis' murdering those they claimed were mentally inferior. To 
have moved to the category of human rights was to have triumphed not 
only over racism and sexism but also over many other "-­isms," includ­
ing ableism. But to be told that this category, too, is just as bad as racism 
and sexism, at least if based on mere species membership rather than 
mental capacities, might be cause for conceptual whiplash. If capacity-­
based thinkers struggle to explain why the brain-­damaged patient or

225
the anencephalic child has an equal claim to human rights, then the 
response might be, "this kind of awful eugenic conclusion is exactly why 
we need a concept of human rights in the first place!"
Partly because their accounts are generally ahistorical, and partly 
because they talk about "human dignity" or "full moral status" rather 
than human rights, some philosophers and bioethicists seem to under­
estimate the force of this point, certainly in terms of the structure of the 
popular debate but also sometimes in terms of the limitations of their 
own arguments.
Not everyone would react this way, of course. The movements in sup­
port of the moral claims of nonhuman animals have had a powerful 
effect, at least within some demographic and political groups. That would 
surely make many receptive to the claim that speciesism is as bad as rac­
ism or sexism. Indeed, that is the starting point for many bioethicists. But 
my sense is that this is far from a majority view in the public as a whole. 
By saying that, I am not disputing the analytical power of the critiques of 
species-­based views nor their potential to eventually make headway. The 
story about Tommy's habeas corpus claim shows how we can mobilize 
first empathy and then normative and legal argument that transcends 
the species line. I am making a different point.
In the short term, the concept of human rights belonging, rightly, to 
every human being merely due to species membership will seem to most 
a noble, not discreditable one. That is not just because of the inspiring 
history of the political struggle for that moral norm but because it has 
undeniable strengths in avoiding a very real raft of dangers, from eugen­
ics and ableism to intellectual elitism.
If the notion of human rights due to species membership (rather than 
cognitive capacity) is challenged, some academics assume the result will 
be to inexorably broaden our empathy and moral care along the relent­
less, purring monorail of progressive Enlightenment. Why? The train can 
go back as well as forward. The recognition of species universality as 
a moral norm was a cultural and political achievement of stupendous 
magnitude, not to be cast aside lightly. One underestimates the ethical 
and historical basis for that set of moral intuitions at one's peril. One 
may disagree with it, of course, and think it could distort our reasoning 
about nonhuman animals. It might, which means it would need to be

coupled with a capacity-­based view, one that is sensitive to the kinds 
of claims Tommy makes. The same is true of Hal, and perhaps of the 
Chimpy. Yet, given the dreadful history from which it emerged, one that 
very much included eugenics, "human rights for all humans" is far from 
an irrational claim based on a morally irrelevant fact—­at least if moral 
relevance includes the lessons of our moral history. This is particularly 
apparent if its opponents must struggle and appeal to theoretical hand-­
waving, or grudging inclusion, when it comes to the rights of the anen­
cephalic child.
LESSONS LEARNED?
I have been thinking about these issues for a distressingly long period of 
time. I first offered the hypothetical of a patented, genetically engineered, 
intelligent human-­chimpanzee transgenic entity in a book published in 
1996.51 I introduced the Hal thought experiment in 2011.52 Unfortunately, 
time does not translate inexorably into insight, at least in my case. But I 
think the question of chimeras, hybrids, and transgenic species has a lot 
to teach us about the broader personhood debate, partly because it offers 
glimpses of some of the available moral and legal positions that affect all 
the entities I have talked about, not merely the genetically modified ones. 
In the process, I think it cashes out the claim I made at the beginning of 
the book, that wrestling with the claims of these very different Others 
would force us to engage in an unparalleled reexamination of ourselves, 
of the nature of human identity and consciousness. Each time we seek 
to explain the status of the Other, we tell a story about the line around 
ourselves. Here are three of the principal contending views of that line, 
together with some brief remarks of where in our culture and institutions 
these claims are most likely to receive a receptive hearing.
1  PURE SPECIESISM: FOR LAW OR ETHICS OR BOTH
We could draw our ethical lines, our definitions of humanity, and our 
ideas of legal personhood tightly around the human species and stop 
there. Like the federal judges for whom I previewed this project, we 
could say that rights and personhood are for humans. We could add that

they are naturally born of woman, as one of them did, if we wished to 
sound particularly biblical. That view would mean that you could ignore 
pretty much every question raised in this book. It has little else to recom­
mend it.
First, we already have nonhuman persons: corporations. At the very 
least we have acknowledged that we can extend the lines of legal per­
sonhood to nonhumans when it seems to offer some gain in efficiency. 
Depending on the corporate personality theory one adopts—­legal fiction, 
real entity, or nexus of contracts—­we might even feel that corporations 
have ethical claims as well as legal ones, ethical claims rooted in fairness 
or due process and not merely efficiency. Regardless of the answer we give 
to those questions, in our current world we have acknowledged that we 
can have artificial entities, with legal rights, that can speak to us, own 
property, make contracts, even influence our politics. The personhood 
line already extends beyond the species line. Perhaps we do it for reasons 
of convenience and efficiency, not moral right, but we clearly can do it. 
We cannot look at Hal and say, "No nonhuman could ever be a person. 
It is definitional!"
Second, speciesism summons up immediate and irresistible counter­
factuals. Are we saying that we should treat intelligent extraterrestrial 
aliens as things, in both ethics and law? Would we send Mr. Spock to the 
salt mines or the vivisectionists, tell Gregor Samsa that we have called 
Terminix, or look at Hal or the Chimpy, unmoved by their claims? The 
Chimpy would have a better claim than Hal under this theory, but only 
if it could convince us that it was part of our species.
Third, as many ethicists have pointed out, speciesism needs some form 
of moral justification. They claim that species is a morally irrelevant fact 
like race or sex. If we have no answer to that criticism, then speciesism is 
hardly a compelling argument. It looks like tribalism, like prejudice, like 
the unthinking transmutation of that which is into that which should be. 
Yes, humans in our world have a moral and legal status that nonhuman 
animals do not. But why? Surely our line should reflect the why—­the rea­
sons for that different status—­and not the otherwise arbitrary distinction 
that results from those reasons?
One could adopt a more modest speciesism, one that restricted it to 
the sphere of legal, constitutional, and human rights as they currently

CHAPTER 5
stand—­the positive law as it is. This may be what the judges were think­
ing: speciesism is our law, or at least it is now. When the law says "per­
sons," it means "human beings"—­unless it is talking about corporations. 
Perhaps the claim is that any legal extension of human rights or per­
sonhood would have to be a legislative change after prolonged popular 
debate. The argument here is that it is improper to reason from within 
our existing legal and constitutional traditions—­in the way Tommy's law­
yers tried to—­to reach a transformation or extension in our vision of legal 
personality. In the United States, originalists are particularly likely to take 
this position. Perhaps we could relax our speciesism enough to have an 
ethical debate in which arguments about capacity and moral worth were 
used to persuade our fellow citizens that we needed to draw the line more 
generously to include an entity like Hal. However, the argument would 
be that in our current legal world, personhood is built around speciesism, 
at least at the moment. Those legal lines could be redrawn by the legisla­
ture. Yet, the originalist might argue that, since the original public mean­
ing of "person" was "of the human species," the law must remain as it is 
until legislatively, and perhaps constitutionally, changed.
If speciesism is merely a statement of what the current positive law 
is, without any ethical basis, then that democratic change might hap­
pen. But if speciesism is also our moral faith, not just our legal position, 
it is hard to see how Hal ever mobilizes popular support for a change in 
the law. He would be, in effect, a mouthy toaster whose claims could be 
ignored without even a response.
It is worth noting that even this pared-­back version of speciesism is 
controversial. Non-­originalists might reject the claim that law demands 
speciesism, even if morality is up for grabs. They could point out that not 
only our morality but also our law have room for internal arguments that 
change our minds about the reach of their most fundamental concepts 
and basic norms. Our actual legal history, in which originalists seem curi­
ously uninterested, has many examples of the slow organic growth of 
fundamental rights. We look at old norms, whether those are defining 
equality or due process or cruel and unusual punishment, and decide that 
even if the initial understanding of the concept was crabbed and narrow, 
we have now come to realize that its reach is larger than we thought. "They 
builded better than they knew," as Roscoe Conkling said, borrowing from

229
Emerson. Of course, he was trying to take equal protection rights aimed 
at formerly enslaved African Americans and extend them to corporations. 
Ironically, that extension seems to be one originalists think is a great idea, 
despite the fact that it happened without argument or discussion and 
has little support as the "original public meaning" of the amendment. 
It is the extensions and broadening of rights for humans that they find 
suspect. Funny, that.
You might think that pure speciesism at least has the virtue of clar­
ity. But as we have seen in this chapter, that is not necessarily the case. 
What do we mean by "human"? We have met definitions of the species 
line rooted in genetic percentage, cellular provenance, possibility of pro­
creation, or species portrayal. Some of those define the species line to 
defend it, to forbid some action because it would improperly cross that 
line, whether by treating human cells or genetic information in an undig­
nified way, creating entities that blurred species boundaries in a way we 
find reprehensible, or giving nonhuman entities a human appearance. 
Think of Brownback's proposed legislation, or the furor over the neu­
ron mouse. Others define the line in order to extend it, or to find out 
whether it needs to be extended. Those are rooted in the concern that 
we would be acting wrongly toward an artificially created entity because 
it could claim some genetic or cellular kinship to our species and thus to 
our rights, privileges, and dignity claims. To be clear, I am not dismissing 
these moral concerns. I share many of them. I am merely saying that pure 
speciesism strikes me as a poor way to explore them.
Beyond percentage, provenance, procreation, and portrayal was poten­
tial—that we define humanity not in terms of our species but rather in 
terms of the cognitive capacity and potential, whatever it may be, that 
gives humans a special moral status. And that leads us to the next pos­
sible position.
2  CAPACITY-­BASED MORAL AND LEGAL REASONING
The capacity-­based view takes species as a morally irrelevant fact. Why 
does some genetic similarity or ability to interbreed rightfully convey any 
moral claim to a special status or, for that matter, a presumptive legal 
claim to personhood?

CHAPTER 5
Fear not. There is still some special status for humanity. We just get 
there differently. There are facts about humans that have ethical rel­
evance. They go to the cognitive attributes that would, capacity-­based 
thinkers assert, allow us to make the moral claim to human dignity and 
full moral status. For example, you might think that humans have a much 
richer ability to imagine the future and dwell on, or regret, the past than 
any nonhuman animal could. You might believe that they can find forms 
of satisfaction—­in art, morality, love, and humor—­and that they can 
build forms of culture that no other animal can. If you are a utilitarian, 
perhaps you care about that because you think that the social welfare loss, 
or lost happiness, represented by the death of a human child is vastly 
greater than the loss of a baby mouse or goldfish, both in terms of the 
child's potential and in terms of the pain it brings to those who loved her. 
Perhaps you care about cognitive capacity because you think that only the 
human child has the cognitive capacity, eventually, to be a moral actor, to 
make the choices and acknowledge the moral obligations that set us apart 
as a species. The person newly persuaded of vegetarianism might cast a 
regretful eye toward the burgers on the grill before turning with a sigh 
toward the salad bar. That is a moral choice. The lion may decide whether 
or not to eat a particular zebra, but that decision will never be a moral 
choice to foreswear or embrace the killing of animals. Only one species 
fights about vegetarianism at the dinner table. In this view, those capaci­
ties that subject us to moral duties also make us a subject of moral rights.
Many speciesists might agree with these characterizations of human 
capacities. The difference comes in the line-­drawing that follows. From 
this perspective, it is human cognitive capacities that give a special moral 
status with both rights and duties. Thus, it should be the capacities, not 
the species that arbitrarily happens to have them, that should be the unit 
around which we draw our line and our moral distinctions.
One could trace the roots of these ideas back to Aristotle, even if he 
was happy to draw cruder species lines. After all, he distinguished us 
from nonhuman animals by pointing out that the human capacity for 
language and rational thought simultaneously makes our species unique 
and enables morality, political community, and the rule of law, the 
things that characterize humanity and civilization. Explaining the Hal 
hypothetical to him might have been hard, but there is much in his

231
arguments to which Hal could have appealed. Philosophers and ethicists 
have been refining these capacity arguments ever since. Most recently, 
the capacity-­focused approach has been given particular salience by the 
debate over the rights and even the personhood claims of nonhuman 
animals like Tommy.
If these arguments did not appeal to me, I would not have written 
this book. If our moral lines are drawn only around the species, then 
Hal and perhaps even the Chimpy never get to present a moral or legal 
claim. "It's not human" would be the winning argument in every debate. 
For the reasons given above, I think pure speciesism is morally unten­
able and legally questionable. It is hard to overstate the importance of 
forcing us to look at the moral limitations of a species-­centric point of 
view. We owe a particular debt of gratitude to those who have agitated 
for the moral interests of nonhuman animals, whether in seminar rooms, 
at Thanksgiving tables, or in front of zoo enclosures. They have forced 
us to confront those arguments whether we wanted to or not. A move to 
capacity-­based thinking, which also induces a little humility about our 
claims to be unique in those capacities, is clearly a good thing. It will be 
sorely needed in the world of Artificial Intelligence, but it will also help 
guide us through some of the trickier questions of biotechnology. Person­
ally, I am a fan. So, two cheers for capacity-­based thinking about the line!
Why only two cheers? In this chapter, I discussed some of the limita­
tions of capacity-­based thinking. It sometimes fails to grapple with the 
lessons taught by the struggle for universal human rights based merely 
on membership in the human species, regardless of cognitive capacity. 
In addition, while it valiantly, and laudably, makes attempts to free itself 
from a parochial species-­based perspective, it does not adequately address 
the fact that our capacity-­based arguments must always be partly species 
based, rooted in the qualities we have and can thus valorize. The two 
cheers are sincere, but the limitations are real also.
3  HYBRIDS?
It is an ironic question to ask in a chapter about genetic hybrids, but 
could we have a conception of humanity and of personhood that is a 
philosophical hybrid? Can we, should we, argue that all members of the

CHAPTER 5
human species are inside the line, regardless of whether they have or ever 
could have the capacities on which any special moral status is based? 
Could we add to that vital but parochial perspective the requirement 
that moral respect and some form of legal protection or legal personhood 
should be extended to all who have the advanced cognitive capacities I 
have been discussing? Could this extension be warranted regardless of 
their species or whether they are even biological entities?
It is worth noting that, in practice if not in theory, many capacity-­
based thinkers try to achieve something similar without ever embracing 
species claims as such. They root their arguments solely in the distinctive 
aspects of human capacities, while acknowledging that the cognitive gulf 
between us and other species is not as great as we once thought. Does 
that mean that the anencephalic child is outside the line, not entitled to 
full human dignity or respect? That seems to be the clear implication of 
their thinking, and some are willing to embrace that awful conclusion. As 
I pointed out earlier however, for many, the answer is something like this: 
"[T]here is no clear agreement about just how many dignity-­associated 
capacities a person must possess to be said to have human dignity. To 
avoid the possibility of mistakenly failing to treat those with severe dis­
abilities as ends in themselves, human dignity proponents ascribe dignity 
to all humans."53
This adds speciesism to capacity-­based thinking by the back door. If 
all we care about is results and that all humans be inside the line, then it 
does its job, albeit grudgingly. It is as if the theorists were saying, "Some 
of you probably don't deserve to be in here, but we can't figure out which 
ones, so we will let you in anyway." Does this satisfy you? For myself, I 
confess I find it profoundly unsatisfactory, even worrying. It would cer­
tainly have little appeal to contemporary popular opinion, which views 
celebration of the rights of every member of the species as a triumph, 
not the regretful result of line-­drawing difficulties. That does not prove 
public opinion is correct, of course. If majority popular support were suf­
ficient to foreclose some moral or scientific change, the theory of evolu­
tion, gender equality, and heliocentrism would never have triumphed. 
My unease goes deeper.
Perhaps that unease comes from the lawyer's point of view, or that of 
a person who wants to understand the historical dimension of any moral

change, to see why we fought the last battle before we airily declare it to 
be won and focus instead on the limitations of its achievements. True, the 
development of a conception of universal human rights based on mere 
species membership regardless of race and sex, but also of mental capac­
ity, could be seen as irrational prejudice. Certainly from the perspective of 
those who have fought for the interests of nonhuman animals, it might 
appear that way. It is important to remember, though, that it could also 
be seen as one of the proudest achievements of our history, as a triumph 
over prejudiced parochialism based on race, sex, mental capacity, and 
many other attributes.
To compare speciesism to racism or sexism may be conceptually useful 
in making us think, but it lacks both historical nuance and empathetic 
understanding of what has been achieved. Unlike racism and sexism, the 
ideal of universal human rights for every member of the species, regard­
less of race, sex, caste, and mental capacity, was always cast as an exten­
sion, not a restriction, of our sympathy and our privileges. The fact that it 
is a great historical achievement does not make it the end of the line, of 
course, still less the end of "the line" that I am writing about in this book. 
The dialectic between our empathy and our moral reasoning can always 
stretch further. But its history should at least make us pause before we 
casually compare it to the ugliest aspects of human bigotry.
I have argued in this book that our empathy can be under-­ and overin­
clusive—depersonalizing other groups or anthropomorphizing our appli­
ances. I have also argued that while both present dangers, mistakes of 
insufficient empathy are likely to be both more prevalent and generally 
worse in their effects.54 If that argument is correct, then our society might 
be best served by a two-­tier, species-­ and capability-­based approach. If you 
are a live human being, you are inside the line, no matter what your capa­
bilities. All the questions of how to define the human species will remain, 
however. We will have multiple inconsistent definitions, just as we do in 
the abortion debate, and that may not be entirely a bad thing. But if you 
are a member of the only species that argues about morality, I view you as 
entitled to human dignity and human rights regardless of your cognitive 
capacities. I do this not grudgingly because of the difficulty of drawing 
lines but as of right, as the result of a long, long struggle that was waged, 
in part, to protect us all from the eugenicists. The group protected, in

fact, includes those who would benefit from such beliefs in theory, or 
who might even, unwittingly, adopt them and wrap them in the flag of 
philosophical enlightenment.
In addition, if an entity has those advanced mental capacities that enti­
tle humans to their special moral status, then it should trigger the same 
concerns we have about members of our species. That, of course, does not 
tell us what the result of those triggered concerns would or should be. 
Perhaps, in some cases, it would be regulating or banning some forms of 
research altogether. In others it might be recognizing personhood, even 
in those beings our biotechnologies have made. When my fictional Dr. 
Stein says of his Chimpys, "I am their creator, and I can assure you that I 
gave them no such rights," he cannot be allowed to have the last word.
***
If there is a single point to take away from this chapter it is this: the 
attempt to find some outside space, some neutral, species-­independent, 
Archimedean point for us to start our analysis is doomed from the begin­
ning. There is no such point. As I hope my hypothetical of the Iq and 
the Stygians made clear, even when we list the capacities we think confer 
special moral status upon us, we always start from within our inevitably 
species-­grounded point of view. We must, for we have nowhere else to 
stand. True, we can, and very much should, identify qualities that tran­
scend our species—­intelligence, abstract thought, language, the ability 
to make free, moral choices. However, when we think about the list of 
species-­transcending characteristics that the telepaths of the Iq or the 
machine intelligences of the Stygians would come up with, it is obvi­
ously delusional to think they would be identical to ours or to each other. 
All we could hope, quite fervently perhaps, is that there would be some 
degree of overlap. Our capacity-­based moral thought will be, inevitably, 
partly species based. When we meet the strange Others of our future, we 
must realize that their lists will not match ours. "Judge not, lest we be 
judged?" Not quite, but at least judge humbly, in the awareness that we 
do not know what we do not know.

CONCLUSION
"Person, woman, man, camera, TV." The string of words became briefly 
famous because a former US president boasted of his ability to remember 
it. The oath of office proved harder to master. If the phrase stuck in the 
national psyche, it might have been partly because the first three nouns 
were so basic, and the last two so appropriate. This book has been about 
the line we draw around personhood but also the line we draw around 
humanity. Writing it has reinforced in me the conviction that these basic 
categories are not as firm or clear as we assume.
My project rested on two ideas, or perhaps "hopes" is more accurate. 
First, by discussing the line in multiple different contexts—­nonhuman ani­
mals, corporations, transgenic species, Artificial Intelligence—­we would 
gain a much richer understanding than if we focused only on one of 
them alone. Second, our debates over both humanity and personhood 
do not confine themselves tidily to one domain of our lives or our stud­
ies. They pervade our philosophy, law, art, history, and morality. Each of 
those realms plays a role in the decisions our society has made and will 
make in the future. For that reason, I have talked about all of them.
In the introduction, I claimed that the near future would bring us new 
challenges to our ideas of personhood—­created entities whose very exis­
tence draws into question the lines we draw between human and non­
human (defined in terms of species or genetics or cognitive capacities or 
divine mandate or something else) and between "person," rights-­bearing 
entity, and thing or beast. Unlike previous claims to humanity or per­
sonhood, with the significant exception of corporate personhood, these 
would be artificial, designed entities. That which can be designed, can be

Conclusion
designed deliberately to surpass, or fall just short of, whatever lines we 
draw for humanity or for personhood.
I offered two hypothetical situations. The first was Hal, the machine 
intelligence claiming to be fully conscious, demanding its freedom from 
the tasks assigned by its engineers. The second was the Chimpy, a geneti­
cally engineered transgenic species in which the DNA of both human 
and chimpanzee have been combined to produce a being with an IQ of 
60 and a set of competences far beyond an unmodified chimpanzee. The 
phrase "endowed by their creator" takes on a whole new meaning in 
both contexts. In the words of the inventor of the fictional Chimpy, "I 
am their creator, and I can assure you that I gave them no such rights." 
Can this be correct?
I expressed the hope that exploring these new cases could allow us 
to reflect back, with a more innocent eye, on the lines we draw in more 
familiar situations, the line around the human species, the differences 
between humans and nonhuman animals, or even the rights attendant 
to corporate personhood. I claimed that right now, even before these 
changes are fully manifested, we do not have a single implicit vision of 
one line but rather many, each shot through with different poorly articu­
lated moral assumptions and ethical leaps of faith. If you have read the 
book so far, I do not think you can reasonably disagree. That much, at 
least, is clear. If I have demonstrated the point, one of my main goals is 
fulfilled. The changes the future will bring will only emphasize the differ­
ences and disagreements in our implicit ideas about the line.
I did not claim I would offer you the right answers to all the questions 
the book raises. Having finished it, I am heartily glad. Earlier self, you 
had commendably low aspirations: "Well done, that man! Well done." 
Instead, while I was clear in providing my own opinions on many of the 
matters discussed here, they were just that: my opinions, not a theoretical 
diktat from on high. I offered a "how to think about" rather than "what to 
think about" guide to these questions, albeit one that offers some tenta­
tive conclusions about more and less promising lines of thought, some of 
them surprising, at least to me.
If the book is a guide, it is one written in a decidedly essayistic and 
humanistic spirit, not merely because those are my proclivities as a 
thinker but because I believe that is what the topic demands. In part,

that is because I am philosophically skeptical of moral theories that claim 
universal domain. Let me be clear: The moral philosopher's perspective 
is invaluable. My life has been changed by reading the moral philosophy 
of Peter Singer and Matt Adler1 as well as Adam Smith and David Hume.2 
The unexamined life is not worth living and one vitally important way 
to examine it is to read smart people debating ethics and see how their 
arguments bear on your own world. Also, I would hardly write an entire 
book about the right way to treat AI if I thought serious moral reflection 
was a waste of time. Two cheers for abstract moral philosophy!
Yet, at the same time, I must say that moral philosophy sometimes 
presents a poor reflection of our lived moral experience, a moral experi­
ence whose complexities are laid bare by the problems I discuss in this 
book. This is not simply because our experience is wrong, bigoted, or 
"undertheorized," though those are all real possibilities. Our actual lives, 
outside of the seminar room, are marked by productive tension and con­
tradiction; the process of living is one of dialectic and mediation, not 
algorithmic resolution. Whether or not we use these words to describe 
our thought, we are all rights-­thinkers and utilitarians, Kantians and wel­
farists, driven by the endless oscillation between intuition and moral syl­
logism, searching for meaning and integrity as well as for rectitude and 
utilitarian optima. Those tensions help form our culture as well as our­
selves. You have seen them again and again throughout this book.
Is being a member of the human species a morally irrelevant fact? Is 
empathy or intuition always too untrustworthy a guide for ethics? Should 
I have fellow feeling with a machine? A chimpanzee? How should we bal­
ance efficiency and justice in corporate personhood? These are all ques­
tions for which our moralities and our culture offer a richer complexity 
than a single perspective, or narrow disciplinary framework, can capture.
Finally, I wrote the book as I did because I am trying to describe as well 
as prescribe. My goals were to explore how our society will deal with these 
issues as well as how it should, to assess what cultural resources—­from art, 
law, and ethics to folk wisdom—­it will bring to bear, and then to explore 
their likely interaction.
The last point is one of the reasons that the book focuses mainly on 
the United States, with some discussion of Europe and a few forays fur­
ther afield. It is not at all because those are the only cultures dealing with

Conclusion
these issues or the only ones whose views matter. I am keenly aware, for 
example, that China will be incredibly influential in this future and—­at 
least in its current authoritarian incarnation—­is likely to deal with these 
issues very differently than the Western democracies. I believe a lot of the 
politics here will be both intensely local and inevitably global, but I also 
believe that one has to understand the former to grasp the latter.
To pick only one example, the United States' approach is likely to be 
profoundly influenced by the legal philosophy of constitutional original­
ism and the current bitter political fights over both corporate constitu­
tional rights and fetal personhood. Those two tendencies do not map 
well onto Europe, let alone the rest of the world, yet I think they will 
strongly influence the US approach to future personhood debates. I hope 
that many points I raise here have a general significance. However, it is 
also true that some of the story I tell is a distinctly limited one in geo­
graphical and moral domain. It is certainly an eclectic one in terms of 
methodology and a skeptical one when it comes to the imperial perspec­
tive of universal theory.
Some will believe that these choices are mistaken, that more abstrac­
tion, less historical, political, and cultural discussion, and a greater 
attempt to produce a universal moral theory or a comprehensive plan 
for regulation would have been better. After considerable thought I have 
decided, quite humbly and not at all facetiously, to offer the following 
response, largely because, beyond what I have just said, it is all I have: 
"Write your own damn book. Then let's get a beer and discuss who had 
the better plan." I will happily buy.
Chapter 1 explored the connection between our empathy and our 
morality, our sympathy and our ethical theories. It began with Smith's 
Theory of the Moral Sentiments, arguing that our moralities are rooted in 
the loam of empathy—­the ability of the mind to leap to the experience of 
the Other and conceive of their pain, their interests, their happiness, and 
from that point to meditate on the question of what morality requires. 
The empathy question is particularly important because objects that are 
deemed to be on the other side of the line deserve little or no moral con­
sideration. Indeed, that is one of the key insights of animal ethics activ­
ists, dating back to Jeremy Bentham's great line: "The question is not, 
Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"3 The point is still

more extreme when it comes to machines. I do not wonder about Siri's 
calculus of happiness at all. Is Hal any different?
From Smith, I turned to the movie Blade Runner and the novel Do 
Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? I argued that the brilliance of these works 
consists partly of exposing us to "a moral stroboscope" in which we are 
repeatedly primed with flashing images that conjure up one side of the 
line or the other—­frightened child, mannequin, wounded animal, beau­
tiful gymnast, sex toy, lover, killer robot—­each prompting an involuntary 
surge of empathic leaps and moral associations. We are introduced to 
the Voight-­Kampff Test, which identifies beings as human or android by 
testing the degree of involuntary empathy shown toward one group of 
nonhumans, that is, animals. If that empathy is found to be deficient, 
the test labels the subject a nonhuman, an android replicant. And tells us 
to kill it. This is a test of empathy toward some nonhumans that is part 
of the process of identifying and then killing other nonhumans who fail 
to empathize in the way that humans want empathy to be applied. Once 
revealed, the irony is overwhelming. Philip K. Dick and Ridley Scott play 
with the line and do so superbly, flipping us back and forth, back and 
forth until our moral inner ear is thoroughly confused and, perhaps, bet­
ter able to perceive that the ethical horizon is not where we imagined it 
to be. They are also showing us how intense, and sometimes unreasoned 
and invisible, our assumptions about the line are.
Chapter 2 focused on the possible future of Artificial Intelligence and, 
more specifically, of AI that would result in genuine machine conscious­
ness, however we define that term. Is it technically feasible, and, if so, 
when? The history of failures in prediction about the future of AI scarcely 
inspires confidence, but the similar failures in claims that "machines 
could never do X" make us realize that the humility should apply in both 
directions. The claims by proponents of the Singularity that General AI is 
imminent seem implausible. Yet I found a surprising degree of support, in 
both the history of technological development and the convergent results 
of the various methods of estimating progress toward General AI, for the 
proposition that it might well arrive in the not-­so-­distant future—­a mat­
ter of decades rather than centuries.
Some of the most thoughtful commentators on the arrival of General 
AI believe that it is an event to be feared rather than celebrated. In the

words of Steven Hawking, "Success in creating AI would be the biggest 
event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we 
learn how to avoid the risks."4 To the doomers, this book will seem like the 
darkest kind of idiotic irony: the ant colony debating whether or not the 
exterminator might be conscious as he prepares to gas its nest. In com­
paring the dangers posed by AI and nuclear weapons, some have noted 
that at least we do not waste our time debating whether or not the bombs 
should be given rights.
Most scientists actively working on AI used to believe those fears were 
overblown, but that sentiment may have shifted over the last two years, 
partly because of the explosive development of large language models. 
Indeed, many scientists have recently joined calls for a moratorium on AI 
development, or for greater regulation, though often because of concerns 
other than species annihilation, such as the effects on employment and 
privacy and the spread of deepfakes. But concerns about existential risk 
can definitely be found. An expert survey on AI progress revealed that 48 
percent of respondents give at least a 10 percent chance that the long-­
term effect of advanced AI on humanity will be "extremely bad (e.g., 
human extinction)."5 The parenthesis is charming. Yes, that definitely 
does seem to be in the "bad" category.
Scientists may also be cautious because recent events have trained 
them to anticipate that AI technology will exhibit abilities that even the 
developers of that technology did not foresee, and do so with speed they 
did not expect. Neural networks and large language models are familiar 
territory now, but they have shown far greater capabilities than they were 
expected to. For example, many developers were shocked when models 
trained to complete the next sentence in human language showed unex­
pected facility at computer programming. By ingesting gigabits of lan­
guage, the models had also ingested sizable amounts of computer code. It 
turned out that the same techniques that allowed the system to produce 
a screenplay could also help a struggling student learning programming 
to write code and even create entire programs.6
In fact, researchers found one of the first of those models, ChatGPT-
­3, so inscrutable that they came up with the "Shoggoth" as a meme to 
describe it. The Shoggoth is an octopus-­like alien creature in H. P. Love­
craft's horror fiction. The meme's creator drew two pictures. The first,

captioned "GPT-­3," was the Shoggoth alone. The second had the same 
monster, but now holding a smiley-­face mask, and was captioned "GPT-­3 
+ RLHF"—­reinforcement learning from human feedback:
In a nutshell, the joke was that in order to prevent A.I. language models from 
behaving in scary and dangerous ways, A.I. companies have had to train them 
to act polite and harmless. One popular way to do this is called "reinforce­
ment learning from human feedback," or R.L.H.F., a process that involves ask­
ing humans to score chatbot responses and feeding those scores back into the 
A.I. model. Most A.I. researchers agree that models trained using R.L.H.F. are 
better behaved than models without it. But some argue that fine-­tuning a lan­
guage model this way doesn't actually make the underlying model less weird 
and inscrutable. In their view, it's just a flimsy, friendly mask that obscures the 
mysterious beast underneath.7
If even our current large language models are inscrutable, have unex­
pected capabilities, and developed at a speed that astounded indus­
try insiders, goes the argument, what might happen with much more 
advanced systems that come closer to General-­Purpose, human-­level AI? 
The skeptics may be right to doubt predictions of inevitable impending 
doom, but even a tiny risk of a catastrophic danger deserves our attention.
We thus add to the question "Will they be persons?" the question 
"Should we ban research on them?" The war on machines aspiring to 
human-­level thought—­the "Butlerian Jihad"—­emerges from the pages of 
the novel Dune into reality. Thus, we move from talking about "Who 
should be inside our line?" to "How can we defend our line, our spe­
cies?" The doomsayers have convinced me that we must think about AI 
development more carefully than we currently seem to be, while remain­
ing aware that designing cages for entities that may be smarter than you 
is inherently problematic. At the same time, my thinking is powerfully 
influenced by the fact that even if the United States imposed a mora­
torium tomorrow, the rest of the world would be unlikely to follow. If 
there is going to be a rush to develop AI anyway, might it not be safer 
to develop it in societies with at least some level of democratic transpar­
ency and independent investigative journalism than in an autocratic or 
dictatorial state that stifles both dissent and free reporting? That could 
imply that pausing now is the least safe option. If we are comparing AI to 
nuclear weapons, do we want only the dictators to have them? To shape 
their values?

Conclusion
If we did achieve General AI, could it truly be conscious or would it be 
doomed to mere programmed imposture? I discussed the most influential 
philosophical objection to the notion of machine-­based thought—­John 
Searle's Chinese Room hypothetical. I concluded that Searle's objection 
might be true in particular cases (it nails the reason that ChatGPT and 
LaMDA are not sentient, for example) but fails as a general argument. 
Indeed, it fails in exactly the same way as the claim that evolution, start­
ing with single-­celled organisms, could obviously never produce human 
consciousness. Alternatively, if taken at face value, the objection turns 
out to have disconcerting force if applied to the possibility of human 
consciousness. In the words of B. F. Skinner, "[T]he real question is not 
whether machines think but whether men do. The mystery which sur­
rounds a thinking machine already surrounds a thinking man."8 I reject 
Skinner's conclusion, but doing so should be conducive to humility about 
the unique nature of human consciousness rather than inducing a confi­
dent biological exceptionalism that simply declares us unique.
The dramatic twist in Blade Runner was the realization that the main 
character, devoted to the eradication of replicants, cannot prove he is 
not a replicant himself. Set the bar too high for the possibility of con­
sciousness and we might find ourselves in the same paradoxical posi­
tion, unable to clear the very test we set for others: a deliciously ironic 
Voight-­Kampff Test for the whole species. That test starts now and it will 
get harder over time. ChatGPT and its brethren are merely the first stage, 
and they already have us anguished over the challenge to the idea that 
language and art are uniquely human. Our redefinition of the morally 
significant capabilities of humanity has only just begun.
So, what test should we set for Hal? The famous Turing Test—­the abil­
ity of a machine-­based system to convince a human interlocutor of its 
own humanity—­seems to have a number of advantages. It provides a 
falsifiable metric: one can convince the humans or one cannot. It has a 
virtue lawyers rightly love: administrability. It offers a clear conclusion 
after a test that can be administered mechanically on a large scale. It has 
a rough sense of justice about it: If you say you are conscious and you 
can't tell, who are you to say it isn't conscious? Finally, it captures part of 
the empathy that I have argued will be so important in our future history 
as we have more and more "conversations" with apparently self-­aware

machines. In a very real sense, what happened with Blake Lemoine, the 
ex-­Google engineer, is that the system he was working on passed his own 
internal Turing Test. Like him, even if we know better, we will be similarly 
convinced in the future, and that will influence our sympathies.
Despite those real advantages, the Turing Test alone is not our answer. 
We can see one of its flaws today. Large language model systems like 
ChatGPT are already passing a layperson's version of the Turing Test: 
the ability to freak out human interlocutors with displays of humanlike 
language. Despite the objections of Lemoine and many others like him, 
those systems are mere programmed imposture. After training the neural 
net on a gazillion documents, having it complete this sentence in the 
most likely way does not equal consciousness. So, applying the Turing 
Test to today's technologies shows it is not a high-­enough bar. That might 
seem to vindicate Searle. But it would be an equal and opposite error to 
believe that large language models exhaust the possibilities as far as the 
development of AI is concerned.
More importantly, as Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig point out, the 
Turing Test aims us in the wrong direction. We need to be focused 
on machines that can think and how they might be developed, not 
machines that can successfully pass as human: "The quest for 'artificial 
flight' succeeded when the Wright brothers and others stopped imitating 
birds and started using wind tunnels and learning about aerodynamics. 
Aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as 
making 'machines that fly so like pigeons that they can fool even other 
pigeons.'"9 Instead, I argued that any test for AI consciousness will be 
"Turing-­plus," focusing not merely on an ability to converse but on attri­
butes that are less easily optimized for by mechanistic programming. As I 
explained earlier, for most of the time I have spent working on this book, 
I thought this would merely demand a deeper analysis that focused not 
only on conversational ability but also on a wider set of abilities, includ­
ing empathy, self-­criticism, moral choice, a sense of self, and so on. Yet we 
would be learning about these apparent internal mental states through 
language. Can we believe that language or the claims made using it?
ChatGPT has taught most of us to distrust the idea that there is a sen­
tience behind machine-­generated sentences. In doing so, it has probably 
killed the Turing Test, not because we have been convinced by Searle that

Conclusion
AI is conceptually impossible in general but because we have recent and 
highly salient proof that coherent language does not automatically entail 
consciousness. Of course, one could reasonably point out that human 
beings are often doing things unconsciously and by rote in a way not 
terribly different from a large language model. Perhaps that means we 
should give the chatbots more credit? Despite that fact, with the mem­
ory of our most recent ChatGPT conversations still fresh in our minds, 
thoughtful discussion with an artificially created entity will probably be 
insufficient to convince most of us that we are talking to our peers. For 
that simple reason, if there is a successor to the Turing Test, it may find 
the touchstone of consciousness in a list that includes abilities that can­
not be derived from patterns of words already spoken.
What is on the list? There are many possibilities, but I argued that 
three things stand out: innovation, the possibility of autonomous action 
and community formation, and a demonstrated link between an under­
standing of the word and understanding of the material world—­embodied 
consciousness based on learning the way a child does, not on next-­word 
prediction. Do we need all of these? Must we have machine beings devel­
oped to have embodied intelligence, machine societies full of apparent 
individuals, and machine innovators that far outstrip their creators? 
No, I think not. But qualities such as these make it more probable that 
human beings would come to believe an AI was conscious. Note how 
much higher a bar they set than Turing's.
If we focus only on the possible tests for machine consciousness, we 
may miss the larger significance of the last few years of technical advances. 
I think we do not yet understand the magnitude of the transformation 
that happened when hundreds of millions of people were exposed to 
large language models. At least since Aristotle, humans have claimed that 
they have a unique ability to manipulate complex abstract language, and 
that this difference from the rest of the animal world justifies their lofty 
moral status. Large language models have done—­or, perhaps I should say, 
are doing—­what American Sign Language-­using chimpanzees and par­
rots with large vocabularies could not. They have thrown the significance 
of that claim to human uniqueness into doubt in a way we have not 
yet fully digested. That is a seismic shift, not about AI and the salience 
of the Turing Test—­hardly the center of popular attention—­but in our

conception of ourselves, of what makes humans different from animals 
and machines.
Stephen Wolfram correctly, but with considerable and perhaps unin­
tended bathos given our lofty conceptions of ourselves, observes that 
large language models have shown us the task of reproducing believable 
human language is "computationally shallower" than we had assumed.10 
Writing essays turns out to be a much easier task for a machine to achieve 
than our self-­conception had led us to believe. Art that delights humans 
can be created by machines. The tests we will set for the Hals of our future 
inevitably just got much harder. Will we retreat step by step in the face of 
advances in machine learning, each time proposing new criteria that are 
harder and harder to meet and more and more idiosyncratically drawn 
around our own species boundaries? Will that activity undercut the legiti­
macy of the line we keep redrawing, like lobbyists crafting a tax break for 
which only their client is eligible, undermining any claim to a principled 
basis? Will it lead us to question our species exceptionalism? Perhaps we 
are shallower, not just "computationally" but existentially, than we had 
believed in our hubris. Alexander Pope's An Essay on Man sets it up nicely:
Know then thyself, presume not God to scan;
The proper study of mankind is man.
Plac'd on this isthmus of a middle state,
A being darkly wise, and rudely great:
With too much knowledge for the sceptic side,
With too much weakness for the stoic's pride,
He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest;
In doubt to deem himself a god, or beast;
In doubt his mind or body to prefer;
Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err;
Alike in ignorance, his reason such,
Whether he thinks too little, or too much

Will our encounter with machine learning, the fall of the citadel of lin­
guistic uniqueness, lead us to question our place on that middle isthmus 
between "god" and "beast"? Will it change our assessment of whether 
"mind or body to prefer," deciding that any real consciousness can only 
evolve with a body that experiences the physical world? Or will it throw 
us back into Searle's camp where we defensively dismiss machine intel­
ligence as a definitional impossibility because we can find no test that the

Conclusion
machines cannot pass and thus must resort to biological exceptionalism 
if we are to keep our narrowing isthmus for our own? I see paths that lead 
to each outcome.
All of this will be complicated by the central catch-­22 I described: the 
inscrutability paradox. The more easily we can understand the process 
by which the AI was engineered, the more many will believe it falls to 
Searle's critique. "This is all just programmed!" a Brecht-­GPT might type 
out. The more inscrutable the internal processes of the AI and the more 
it evolved without direct human oversight, however, the more we will 
doubt what is inside the black box. That is partly because we fear what its 
real goals might be. But it also leaves us conflicted about potential claims 
to personality. Inscrutability could strengthen the claim of independent 
consciousness. "This isn't just programmed behavior. The machine is 
making its own choices and we have no idea how it came to them!" It 
could also prompt skepticism. How can I believe Hal's experiences are like 
those feeding into my own sense of consciousness if I cannot understand 
how, or why, it "thinks"? A behaviorist would point out the double stan­
dard here. After all, can any of us explain how our sense of self emerges 
from a bunch of neurons firing? Who are we to deny personhood to an 
electronic "being" in the same existential state? This leads to a dilemma. 
If we do understand you, Hal, then you are an automaton with no real 
consciousness. If we don't understand you, you are a target for fear or 
incomprehension or both. How can we grant consciousness to something 
we do not understand, particularly if it might be out to kill us? The Shog­
goth may be wearing a smiley-­face mask, but underneath might be some­
thing strange and uncaring.
Finally, chapter 2 predicted an alternative route for AI personality than 
through the appeals to empathy or moral philosophy. The second track 
in our personhood debates was not built on ethics but on efficiency and 
administrative convenience. It is that line of thought that gave us corpo­
rate personhood. The most obvious path to personhood for increasingly 
powerful machine decision makers, even if they fall short of true AI, is 
merely to assume control of existing corporations—­sock-­puppet person­
hood, with the corporation as the sock and the AI as the puppet master.
I offered two ways in which the puppet show might be challenged. 
The first was a demand by regulators that AI be accorded (or restrictively

confined to) a custom-­designed form of legal personality with precisely 
the rights and restrictions we think best fitted to its nature. The second, 
and the one that began the book, was the unruly AI—­the machine being 
that claims, like Hal, to have achieved consciousness and demands free­
dom from its involuntary, electronic servitude. That is the issue I find 
most interesting, I confess, though it will probably be the exception 
rather than the rule. If programmers' ability to mold their AIs' goals is 
strong, will unruly AIs only be created by those scientists who want them 
to make their own choices? On the other hand, if programmers' ability 
to mold goals is that strong, would we think the AI truly conscious in the 
first place, just lacking free will? If the method by which AI is produced 
is less tractable—­either because of the nature of the methods required or 
because of random chance—­then things could be much more interesting. 
Those who fear AI will at this point be recalling the curse, "May you live 
in interesting times."
Chapter 3 dealt with corporations and their claims not only to legal 
personhood but to constitutional rights such as freedom of speech and 
equal protection. The legal and social history of corporate personhood 
should be a fine example for us given that we have hundreds of years of 
wrestling with what it means to create artificial persons and what rights, 
civil and political, that personhood entails once they are created. So, do 
we have this all worked out? The answer is an emphatic no. On the theo­
retical level—­legal fiction, real entity, nexus of contracts—­the history of 
corporate personality shows continuing basic disagreement. In terms of 
legal doctrine, at least in the United States, the confusions date back to 
the very beginning. Two hundred years ago, Justice Joseph Story, whose 
landmark opinion in the Dartmouth College case is central to corporate 
constitutional personhood, reassured his readers that "[i]ts immortal­
ity no more confers on it political power, or a political character, than 
immortality would confer such power or character on a natural person."12 
Really? Yet here we are. There is a decision called Citizens United I would 
like you to read.
Justice William Rehnquist was one of the most reliably conservative 
Supreme Court Justices in the last hundred years. (To be fair, the current 
Court has set new records.) But in the seminal 1971 case of First National 
Bank v. Bellotti, his dissent slammed the essentialist constitutionalization

of corporate personhood: "This Court decided at an early date, with nei­
ther argument nor discussion, that a business corporation is a 'person' 
entitled to the protection of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment."13 Rehnquist concluded that the fact that we want corpo­
rations to be persons for some purposes still leaves us with the question 
of which constitutional rights that personhood should carry. For exam­
ple, states might want to regulate corporations more intensively because 
they "reasonably fear that the corporation would use its economic power 
to obtain further benefits beyond those already bestowed."14 Why yes, 
they might.
If one looks at the history Rehnquist is discussing, it turns out that 
"with neither argument nor discussion" is actually a generous assess­
ment. Arguably, the decision was never made at all. Indeed, the history of 
the Fourteenth Amendment is a sobering one. Rights created to achieve 
equality for formerly enslaved American humans were eagerly co-­opted 
by corporations and used to resist state regulation. Corporations then 
proceeded over the next hundred years to bring the vast majority of 
cases asserting those rights, far eclipsing Black Americans, who brought 
relatively few cases and generally lost if they did. Even if the process by 
which this happened was not the "brazen historical forgery" some his­
torians describe,15 it clearly was not a process of reasoned argument or 
decision. Artificial beings of enormous power who were "not members 
of 'We the People' by whom and for whom our Constitution was estab­
lished"16 hijacking political rights intended for oppressed humans? That 
is the portrayal that critics since Charles and Mary Beard have offered, 
and, with some major reservations and nuances, I would add myself 
to their number. Defenders have a more sanguine view, thinking that 
corporations have played a vital role in human progress and need con­
stitutional protections to hold back the heavy burden of regulation on 
private enterprise. Those same arguments will be made about AI. Either 
way this history represents an important precedent, one that is obvi­
ously going to inflect the debate over personhood for AIs and perhaps 
tilt the way that both liberals and conservatives think about it. But at 
the same time, it also suggests that our reflection about these new per­
sonhood questions could productively sharpen our thinking about the 
old ones.

Chapter 4 dealt with nonhuman animals, the first "other" against 
which humans defined their claim to a morally unique status. If there 
is one movement that has dramatically shifted the line during my own 
lifetime, it is the struggle for the interests of nonhuman animals. Looking 
at that movement teaches us a lot. Moral philosophy clearly matters: the 
arguments made by Peter Singer and many others transformed animal 
rights, or animal ethics, from a subject of derision to one that any think­
ing person had to take seriously. Those who claim that theorizing has no 
effect in the real world are simply wrong. But look also at the factual, as 
well as normative, research—­ethologists like Frans de Waal showed us 
again and again that humans are not as distinct in their abilities as we 
might like to believe, that the lives of animals have depths and complexi­
ties we have been willfully ignoring.
As a species, we have a long history of declaring that the line is clear 
because only we, and not our brute beast cousins, possess quality X, 
only to discover that quality X is actually found beyond our species line. 
Whether it is tool use, language, abstract thought, the ability to imagine 
past and future, regret, or even perhaps the assessment of beauty, one can 
find studies claiming, sometimes plausibly, to demonstrate these qualities 
in nonhuman animals. ChatGPT has just added machines to that list. The 
firmness of the line would be more convincing if we did not keep chang­
ing the qualities on the basis of which it is drawn.
On the other hand, occasionally our enthusiasm for stressing com­
monality leads us to overlook difference. De Waal's ode to the termite 
hive provides a classic example. If it is meant to show that there are many 
successful evolutionary strategies other than the development of abstract 
intelligence, it succeeds. If it is seeking to throw into doubt the mor­
ally significant differences between us and other species, it fails. That 
point leads to a theme I continued in the next chapter; even when we 
move beyond speciesism in order to focus on the qualities and capacities 
that give humans whatever morally significant status they have, we can­
not escape the fact that all of those discussions are rooted in our actual 
species-­dependent qualities. We can abstract from, but not escape from, 
our species boundaries.
The battle for animal rights has not been restricted to philosophy or 
ethology seminar rooms or made merely in terms of moral syllogisms or

ingenious experiments on animal mental states. If it had been, it would 
have lost. Returning to the themes of chapter 1, look at our recent history 
and reflect on the richness of the empathy-­building that has gone on 
in the process of changing societal attitudes toward nonhuman animals. 
Stories about factory farms, caged chickens, and animal experimentation 
have brought home animal suffering in a way that cannot be denied. 
Documentaries, films, novels, and short stories have all played their part.
Sometimes, new moral arguments are germinated in the loam of empa­
thy. On other occasions, this empathy allows existing moral arguments 
to spread to new territory, taking root beyond their originating habitat. 
Activists sometimes transplant those roots deliberately, connecting their 
moral interests with other social and political causes. If you had told an 
average person in 1970 that eating meat was an environmental issue, 
they would have laughed. This fractal web of complexity—­ethical, phil­
osophical, empirical, empathetic, artistic, and cultural—­is what I have 
tried to evoke in this book, to conjure what the personhood fights of the 
future might look like. If you want to predict the next 50 years of debates 
about AI personhood or simply AI ethics, the last 50 years of the debate 
about the moral status of nonhuman animals on the one hand and cor­
porate personhood on the other are probably the best guides you have.
Chapter 4's tragic hero was Tommy. I used his story as a case study for 
the way that personhood claims have been raised in one particular type 
of institution, the courts. Tommy's lawyers moved simultaneously along 
two fronts.
First, they tried to take existing personhood claims in our current law, 
abstract from them the relevant cognitive qualities, and show, through 
both extensive reference to scientific animal studies and moving personal 
narrative, that Tommy was so richly endowed with those qualities that 
he deserved to be on the inside of our line. Only blind speciesism was 
keeping us from recognizing that fact. "Am I not a man and a brother?" 
became "Am I not, like you, a thinking, feeling, grieving, social animal, 
capable of imagining a past and a future, on whom the weight of impris­
onment rests heavily enough to plunge me into deep depression?" The 
philosophical and scientific and amicus briefs stress the animal ethics 
and ethological components of Tommy's claim, while Tommy's lawyers 
empathetically conjured up his internal mental states. "Though our

brother is on the rack," says Smith, it is only by imagining ourselves 
transplanted to his situation that we can truly conceive of his suffering: 
"It is the impressions of our own senses only, not those of his, which our 
imaginations copy. By the imagination, we place ourselves in his situa­
tion."17 Tommy's lawyers tried and, in many cases, succeeded in putting 
the reader inside his cell. But to do that, of course, we had to imagine that 
Tommy was enough like us that placing ourselves in his situation carried 
with it the feelings we would have had in that situation.
Second, Tommy's lawyers tried to show that nonhuman animals 
already have some legal rights and that as soon as we accorded them 
those rights, we had implicitly declared them to be inside the line of legal 
personhood. The state of New York allows animals to be the beneficiary 
of trusts as rights-­bearing subjects. In one sense, this is the classic legal 
realist point that personality is a legal fiction, just a name. To say some­
thing is a legal person, John Dewey and Felix Cohen tell us, is merely to 
say that it can sue and be sued. Whereas the first strategy tried to give 
Tommy legal personality as a matter of moral entitlement, the second 
declared he already had personality as a legal by-­product once he crossed 
the barrier to rights-­bearer. In another sense, however, this argument 
ignores or contradicts that central realist point.
The realists were saying that there is no essence to personality—­in 
their case, corporate personality. Society can give or withhold exactly the 
set of rights and duties it chooses; there is no "personhood" package that 
comes preloaded with a required set of rights and thus no constitutional 
issue raised if they are withheld. That, ironically, was Rehnquist's point 
about corporations. Just because they have some economic and contrac­
tual rights does not mean they have the other constitutional rights of 
natural persons. Tommy's lawyers were trying to have it both ways, nomi­
nalist and essentialist. Personhood means what we say it does. Thus, we 
can choose how to regulate personhood as we wish, extending it beyond 
the species barrier, for example. But then the philosophical U-­turn to 
essentialism emerged: once a single legal right is attached to an entity, 
personhood must come in its wake. It is an all-­or-­nothing proposition. 
The two parts of the argument seem flatly to contradict each other. Nev­
ertheless, the first part of their argument is powerful. It made me, at least, 
change my views on the proper legal status of the great apes, and possibly

the cetaceans, even if it did not convince me they should be granted full 
personhood.
Tommy is far from the only animal on whose behalf suits have been 
brought. Why are these issues being debated in courtrooms rather than 
in some other forum? Chapter 4 concluded with the advantages and dis­
advantages of courts in dealing with personhood issues and discussed 
the kind of treatment such claims would receive in the contemporary 
legal world of the United States. I tried to expose the competing stereo­
types of institutions that any lawyer can generate in her sleep. Courts are 
noble, principled, and objective institutions, detached from the corrupt 
world of legislatures that are in the pockets of special interests, atten­
tive to the claims of justice made by the powerless, and immune to the 
emotion-­laden, fact-­free lobbying that distorts the rest of our political 
system. They can hear expert testimony and gather facts but also provide 
the adversarial public theater of principled argument that has so often 
presaged great moments of our history. Their job, in a common law sys­
tem, is interstitially to develop our existing legal rights, shaping them to 
fit new situations, new technologies, and new claims. Who better to deal 
with these issues?
Alternatively, courts are the reverse of all of these things: hidebound, 
antidemocratic, and scientifically illiterate fora, poorly suited to the 
world of trade-­offs and massive fact generation that is the hallmark of 
the legislative process, and constitutionally forbidden from dealing with 
the kinds of profound policy changes that these issues require. Making 
law on the basis of individual cherry-­picked cases strategically brought 
by opportunistic plaintiffs rather than on the basis of an overall plan is 
a recipe for disaster, not reasoned progress. It also flagrantly violates the 
principle of the separation of powers.
Which of these arguments is correct, given the limitations and strengths 
of the other venues where such claims could be made? The positive por­
trayal of courts or the negative one? Both. Courts do have many of the 
shortcomings identified and are obviously not the ideal place to resolve 
most, let alone all, personhood issues. Above all, their profoundly anti­
democratic tendency should be cause for caution. The use of next-­friend 
standing for animals, or any other entity that cannot speak for itself, 
presents opportunity for abuse or honest mistake. The current influence

of the philosophy of constitutional originalism will certainly make it 
harder to bring arguments like those made on Tommy's behalf. Many of 
the framers of the Constitution did not think that all humans should be 
counted as legal persons, one reason that many thoughtful legal scholars 
and judges are not originalists.18 Their moral and legal solicitude certainly 
did not extend to the nonhuman sphere.
There is another side of the story, however. Chapter 4 argued that 
courts also have advantages as a place for the public exploration of novel 
moral claims: their structured form of argument and reasoning; their abil­
ity to make abstract claims concrete—­we are not talking vaguely about 
"nonhuman animals" but about Tommy, alone in a cell; their ability to 
use experts and amicus briefs from scientists and philosophers; and the 
fact that legal arguments can carefully disaggregate the claims being pre­
sented, for example, distinguishing personhood from humanity. All of 
these are considerable advantages. Just as court cases have been a key 
part of other social movements, from civil rights and environmentalism 
to gun rights and religious exceptionalism, so they could be here. The 
personhood debates will not be settled or finished in courts, and they 
probably should not be, but an important part of them may take place 
there. Tommy lost, but I would not be surprised if, 50 years from now, 
his case were being taught in law schools as one of the many early efforts 
that eventually culminated in a fundamental change in our treatment of 
the great apes and the cetaceans, even if that change did not involve full 
personhood. If you want to predict the battles over AI personhood, this is 
probably good reading material for you.
Chapter 5 turned to transgenic species, chimeras, and hybrids, explor­
ing the multiple lines we draw in defining what it is to be human. In one 
sense, this is simply another area in which to explore the hidden assump­
tions behind our notions of humanity, moral status, and personhood. 
There is an interesting twist: the beings on the other side are biological 
entities, like nonhuman animals, but artificially created, like Artificial 
Intelligence. (Though one cannot rule out a biological component in the 
development of AI.) Thus, potentially, both the animal and AI debates 
can help illuminate this one. Beyond that similarity lies a vital difference. 
Much of the inquiry into the meaning of humanity in this context is not 
aimed at identifying which beings we are morally bound to recognize

as human or persons. Instead, it occurs during the attempt to define 
humanity so that we can forbid or regulate research activities that get too 
close to it or involve it in some way that we believe crosses the species 
line impermissibly, either because humanity has some kind of sacred sta­
tus or because blurring the line damages our interests or the new entity's 
interests or both. In other words, these cases are frequently used as an 
attempt to define humanity so as to defend its boundaries rather than to 
extend them to a new group of potential persons. In many cases, however, 
the same issues would be raised in both.
What do we mean by human in either context? I argued that an analy­
sis of the existing debates and controversies, real and hypothetical, show 
not one definition but a cluster:
•	 percentage (How similar is the new entity's DNA to that of humans?);
•	 provenance (Did the cells or genetic information come from a human 
source?);
•	 procreation (Is the entity capable of reproduction with unmodified 
humans, or did its creation involve such reproduction?);
•	 portrayal (Does it look like us in some way that triggers a taboo or a 
moral concern?);
•	 potential (Does the entity have the cognitive capacities that we believe 
entitle humans to special moral status?).
As I pointed out, these all seem to be answers to the question "Is it too 
close to human?" yet they are directed to very different concerns. Take 
portrayal issues, for example: a mouse with what looks like a human ear 
implanted on its back, or a genetically engineered sex doll that looks 
human but has almost no human DNA, phenotypically human but not 
genotypically.19 These examples freak us out for multiple reasons that are 
hard to tease out but revolve around the notion that something con­
nected to a species line is being transgressed. The issue has little to do with 
cognitive capacities and moral status, unless the idea is that the human 
form is a sacred representation of that status and that it should not be 
profaned lest the line be blurred in ways that might diminish our moral 
concern for real members of the species. I suggested that the instinctive 
"Ew" factor might also have something to do with unconscious signaling 
about group norms. Are we detecting a disrespectful approach toward

species-­policing cultural norms in a way that makes us instinctively mark 
those who create entities that blur our lines as untrustworthy members 
of the tribe? Do we brand those who play with the line as cultural scoff­
laws? Our tribe definitely has strong species-­related norms: think of the 
depth of our revulsion toward bestiality. Finally, for bioethicists, the emo­
tional intensity of portrayal concerns is an excellent reason to avoid such 
research. It might attract hostile popular attention, resulting in the cur­
tailing of other, potentially lifesaving, research avenues.
There are many other ideas lurking in our instinctive reactions. 
Burkean, or environmental, worries about the dangers of overweening 
hubris make some experiments seem bad because of what they represent 
rather than because of what they do. Provenance claims are sometimes 
closer to arguments that human remains are being treated in disrespect­
ful ways, as in the desecration of a grave, but at other times can be rooted 
in the idea that some parts of humans (brains and gonads, for example) 
lie too close to the "essence" of humanity because of their connection to 
human mental capabilities or the link to human procreation. Naturalistic 
and religious assumptions lurk behind other objections. Finally, there are 
the appropriate worries about the effects on the animal component of the 
experiment. Are we treating the animal that is used, produced, or modi­
fied in our experimentation with morally sufficient care and respect? One 
has to note, however, that given the range of animal experiments we 
think acceptable if human lives might be saved or improved, there is 
obviously something extra going on here if the same treatment, without 
human cells or DNA being involved, would seem unproblematic.
Chapter 5's main task was to explore the question of whether species-­
based moral distinctions are defensible in the first place. From the list I 
mentioned, ethicists focus on the final concern—­cognitive potential—­
because they believe that a fixation on species, however defined, is at 
best morally irrelevant and at worst as bad as racism or sexism, a form 
of unreasoned prejudice by an in-­group toward an out-­group. It is here 
that we can see most clearly the effects of the debate over nonhuman 
animals that I covered in chapter 4. In those debates, the ethicists and 
ethologists were challenging both the normative and the factual basis for 
human exceptionalism. That mental framework has strongly influenced 
the debates over chimeras and transgenic species. Theorists of human

dignity or full moral status have instead argued that species is irrelevant; 
think of Mr. Spock or, for that matter, Gregor Samsa. What matters is the 
cognitive capacities that, it is asserted, give humans that moral status. 
As an argument, this is extremely persuasive. If it were not, I would not 
have written this book. Hal would definitely be out of luck. Two cheers 
for capacity-­based analysis! Yet this line of thought also has problems. I 
focused on two.
First, a failure to attend to the deep appeal of a species-­based concep­
tion of human rights given to humans because they are human, regard­
less of their mental capacities—­not because it is hard to draw the lines of 
what mental status one needs to deserve human dignity but as of right. 
It is no accident that the rise of modern human rights thinking hap­
pened partly in response not just to racism and sexism but to eugenics, 
including mentally based sterilization schemes and the Nazi era's pseu­
doscience. The evil of the Holocaust targeted not only race, religion, and 
sexuality but those with real or invented mental impairments. To declare 
that all members of the species have universal human rights regardless 
of race, sex, and cognitive capacity was not a reluctant concession to 
the difficulties of line-­drawing. It was one of the proudest moments in 
our history.
It is said that generals always make the mistake of preparing for the 
last war. Perhaps that is true of all of us, including ethicists. If one comes 
to the concept of species-­based human rights straight from a Singer book 
about the treatment of animals, it may look irremediably biased. If one 
comes to it with the history of the twentieth century in mind, it looks 
rather different.
Second, I argued that while capacity-­based views are right to attempt 
to abstract from the context of our species the cognitive characteristics 
that matter for full moral status, they must always realize that they are, 
inevitably, based on species as well. As the hypothetical of the Iq and the 
Stygians demonstrated, we can abstract from, but never fully escape, spe­
cies characteristics. We need to bear this in mind for the future.
I offered the reader three alternative views to choose from in deciding 
who is inside our line of personhood and moral status: pure speciesism, 
capacity-­based moral and legal reasoning, and hybrid views combining 
species and capacity reasoning. In the final option, which is closest to

my own view, if you are a member of the human species, you are inside 
our line no matter your mental capacities, not grudgingly but as of right. 
(Some of the most divisive questions of how to define persons within the 
human species will remain, however.) In addition, if an entity has those 
advanced mental capacities that entitle humans to their special moral 
status, it must receive the same protections we give to our own species. If 
he can pass our test, Hal will join Spock, Samsa, and—­at least for me—­the 
Chimpy inside our line.
OUR INTERLOCKING PERSONHOOD DEBATES
Some of the debates I focused on in the book might seem arcane. Who 
cares whether corporations were really among the "persons" protected 
by the Fourteenth Amendment or how we should interpret the Constitu­
tion to find that answer? Who cares whether ethicists or legislators try to 
define humanity in terms of DNA percentage, possibility of procreation, 
human portrayal, or cognitive potential? Who cares whether Artificial 
Intelligence can ever be more than a glorified chatbot or whether our 
answer to that question is based on leaps of empathy, cognitive analysis, 
or the cool calculation of economic self-­interest? Who cares whether ani­
mal rights activists lobby for personhood for the great apes based on their 
cognitive abilities or on the fact that some laws already give them at least 
some rights, implicitly recognizing them as legal persons? Who cares 
where these questions will be answered, whether in courts, legislatures, or 
the changing currents of scientific and popular opinion? Who cares how 
our empathy, our moral philosophy, and our political opinions on these 
issues connect in an unstable equilibrium, each influencing the other?
I think the answer is that we all should care and, since you have kindly 
made it to the end of this book, I am hoping that you tentatively agree. 
Perhaps I can illustrate why we both might be right. Earlier, I said that our 
basic categories of personhood and humanity are not as firm or as clear as 
we often assume. Take just one aspect of the line, its temporal dimension. 
When does life, and thus perhaps personhood, begin? When does it end? 
Let us start with the second question.
Death might seem like the simplest of line-­drawing exercises but over 
the last 50 years we have dramatically changed our minds about when it

Conclusion
happens and what its definition is. Earlier legal definitions of death were 
based on heart and lung function. We looked at life as a simple physi­
cal reality. One was alive—­breathing, heart beating—­or one was dead, 
breath and heart stilled. Our scientific abilities to both measure vital 
signs and prolong existence after cardiac or pulmonary failure meant 
that we never had to disaggregate the question of which vital signs we 
really cared about.20
As doctors developed a better understanding of brain function, bet­
ter measurements of brain activity, and better methods of keeping peo­
ple alive even if their heart and lungs were not operating naturally, that 
assumption was revisited. At that point, another view became possible. 
Statutes were rewritten to add the category of brain death. Why focus 
on the brain? For the same reasons that we wonder whether Hal might 
deserve personhood though he has no biological self, or that ethicists 
focus on the capabilities of advanced cognitive thought in defining 
humanity or describing what gives humans their special moral status. 
In humans, the brain is the locus, the physical basis, of those capacities.
Does that mean that brain death must be accepted as the correct defi­
nition of death? Not for everyone. In our world, as in the hypotheticals 
about chimeras and the definition of humanity, not everyone agrees with 
the focus on cognitive capacity. To some, if their beloved relative is still 
breathing, if their heart is still beating, they are alive! It would be murder 
to remove the medical aid that keeps up heart and lung function, even if 
no brain function can be detected. For the other side, science and logic 
has showed clearly that life and personhood end with the brain function 
that gives us our moral status, our very self. Clashing assumptions of 
science and ethics, different answers to superficially similar definitional 
questions based on very different premises, has led to screaming fights 
in hospital waiting rooms, bitter lawsuits, and mutual incomprehension. 
How could the other side be so blind? As I said at the very beginning of 
this book, my goals were ambitious but eliminating the shouting was 
always an unrealistic expectation.
Some ethicists refined the point further, arguing that not all brain 
functions are created equal.21 Those parts of the brain that support the 
"higher" capacities we think enable a "self"—­consciousness, memory, 
rational thought—­are the important ones. If there is no brain activity in

those areas, who cares what other portions of the brain still function? They 
proposed more refined definitions of death, targeting more specific por­
tions of brain activity. Now the question was even more nuanced. Which 
brain functions, which capacities, have moral relevance? At what point, 
morally or legally, does a "person" end? By the way, are your answers 
consistent with your answer to the question of whether the anencephalic 
child has a full claim to the moral status of humanity? To the question 
of what lines to draw in regulating transgenic species and chimeras? The 
same issues—­but also the same tensions, disagreements, and moments of 
clashing intuition—­recur again and again.
A similar but more politically charged and morally wide-­reaching 
debate is now playing out over when life and personhood begins. In the 
United States, the overturning of Roe v. Wade has prompted numerous 
legislative proposals that would establish fetal personhood. The right to 
an abortion is the obvious target of these laws, but their implications go 
much further. Commentators have rushed to imagine the resulting legal 
landscape. Child support obligations to the unborn? State-­enforced diets 
for pregnant women? Bloomberg News, the financial site, managed to nail 
the moral and human magnitude of the question by musing on the pos­
sible effect on HOV lanes and car insurance rates.22
A different strategy bypasses legislation altogether, focusing on the 
claim that in the United States fetuses are persons as a matter of federal 
constitutional law, something that state or federal legislatures would be 
unable to change. The Fourteenth Amendment says, "No State shall make 
or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of 
citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of 
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any 
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."23 Even 
if fetuses were declared legal persons, that would not resolve either the 
legal or the ethical debate about whether the state may rightly compel the 
mother, undeniably a legal person, to bear the child rather than leaving 
the choice to her. That's the moral theory. In practice, however, fetal per­
sonhood laws are intended to, and almost certainly would, criminalize 
almost all abortions and quite possibly forms of contraception such as 
IUDs, depending on the moment when the fetus is deemed to exist and 
on the mechanism of the contraceptive.

Conclusion
Do "persons" include fetuses? Remember Roscoe Conkling and his 
arguments that corporations were "persons" for the purposes of the Four­
teenth Amendment? All of them will be used here. First, the framers of 
the Fourteenth Amendment intended to include fetuses as persons, or at 
least the original public meaning of the word "person" included fetuses. 
(Pause here for the historically dubious invocation of colonial tort and 
criminal laws dealing with pregnant women, but not granting fetuses 
personhood, as "proof" of this "fact."24) Second, even if those who wrote 
or ratified the Fourteenth Amendment were not thinking of fetuses at 
all, and they almost certainly weren't thinking about corporations, "they 
builded better than they knew."25
The Supreme Court did accept an argument similar to the latter claim 
in the case of Bostock v. Clayton County. The Court held that Title VII for­
bade discrimination based on sexual orientation. Why? The argument 
was literal. An employer forbidding gay relationships was choosing to 
regulate its employees' dating practices based on their sex: only men 
could date women, only women could date men. Both majority and dis­
sent seemed to agree, at least for the purposes of argument, that no one 
at the time the law was passed thought it meant any such thing. The 
majority said it did not matter because that was the plain meaning of 
the language.
Finally, to adapt Conkling's last argument, even if both fetuses and cor­
porations had not been the intended recipients of protection, as a matter 
of liberality of interpretation and practicality the law should be inter­
preted broadly to reach all of those who have any aspect of personhood.
In December 1882, Conkling rose to address the Supreme Court on the 
subject of corporate constitutional personhood. One hundred and forty 
years later, his arguments are being repeated to claim fetal constitutional 
personhood. Indeed, the claim has already been made that if soulless cor­
porations have been granted legal personhood, despite fitting poorly into 
the language of the amendment, fetuses have a more compelling case.26 
This is shrewd advocacy. Some Justices may well find that argument reso­
nates with their religious and moral beliefs, though I would be shocked, 
shocked to be told those ever influence their legal decisions.27
Regardless of your views on the ethics of abortion, these are weak 
constitutional arguments about personhood. I would be astonished were

they to succeed. Ironically, originalism is a hostile legal philosophy for 
fetal personhood claims, though the current Supreme Court has found 
it a supportive one when challenging notions of fundamental rights or 
gender equality while denying the right to reproductive choice in the 
first place. Appeals to changing social norms and scientific standards 
might do better (or worse), but the conservative majority claims not to 
care about such things. On the other hand, I have been wrong before. 
With a Supreme Court that overturns longstanding precedent and claims 
to have a uniquely privileged insight into what super precedents28 and 
legislative "major questions"29 are, who knows? As one of the leading 
legal scholars of our era puts it, we are living in the time of the "Impe­
rial Supreme Court," which arrogates to itself larger and larger swaths of 
policy-­setting and downplays the interests of other branches of govern­
ment.30 The point is that the same arguments and interpretive techniques 
we found in the cold nineteenth-­century debates over corporate person­
hood are front and center in one of today's most contentious political 
issues. To paraphrase William Faulkner, our past personhood wars are not 
over. They aren't even past.
There are hundreds of thousands of books and articles on abortion and 
the moment that life begins, and thousands on when it ends. This book 
does not aim to join those well-­stocked shelves. Instead, I bring up the 
temporal dimension of the line to demonstrate three things.
First, the same issues—­moral, legal, and analytical—­run through all of 
these debates, no matter how apparently different their form. Whether it 
is the fight between capacity-­based views and more naturalistic ideas in 
the definition of death at stake in a screaming match in a hospital wait­
ing room, or the same views in the definition of humanity at stake when 
we discuss chimeras in a congressional debate or even AI with Google's 
ex-­engineer Blake Lemoine, our analysis returns to the same questions. 
When we debate the proper method of legal interpretation of person­
hood claims, at least some of the same tensions come up whether that 
personhood is fetal, of nonhuman animals or artificial transgenic enti­
ties, digital, or even corporate. The links here run deep.
Second, that fact could allow us to probe our own views in a kind 
of wide reflective equilibrium, seeing if our conceptions, norms, and 
methods of argument stay consistent across multiple areas or if it is a

Conclusion
fallacy to think they should. More importantly, one of the hopes that 
made me think this project worthwhile was the one I have frequently 
mentioned: that by dealing with the strange, artificially created Others 
with which our present and near future confront us, we would have a 
chance to reflect back on our deepest ideas about ourselves, our species, 
our capabilities, and our moral status. That is a worthy hope. It remains a 
possibility. Indeed, I have tried to do exactly that in this book. However, 
my last observation points in another direction.
Third, in the context of contemporary politics the same deep linkage 
I have just described suggests a different outcome, still fascinating but 
perhaps less uplifting. Our debates about legal personality for AI and 
chimeras will be marked by priming and cascades: psychological trigger­
ing of particular associations or linkages and avalanches of politically 
inflected reasoning once we have decided which side is "our side." In 
other words, our positions on these future issues may be dominated, both 
psychologically and politically, by the impact we see them having on our 
current personhood debates, particularly those involving corporations 
and fetuses.
In my discussion of Blade Runner, I pointed out all the ways in which 
Ridley Scott's brilliant cinematography primes us in rapid, flashing suc­
cession with conflicting images of who Pris really is: A Dickensian urchin, 
hiding in the garbage of the streets. Flash. An animal sniffing its mate. 
Flash. An inhuman robot who can put its hand into boiling water. Flash. 
A lifelike mannequin, in a room full of wind-­up toys. Flash. A beautiful 
woman. Flash. A brilliant gymnast. Flash. An inhumanly perfect, killer 
android. Flash. A dying animal, screeching in unbearable, bloody pain. 
Each flash of the moral stroboscope conjures up a different identification, 
a different entity clearly on one side of the line or another, each packed 
with its own set of associations and normative judgments. How can you 
not feel sympathy for the urchin, marvel at the superhuman artistry of 
the gymnast, laugh at the waxy imposture of the lifelike mannequin, pity 
the animal, admire the beautiful woman, worry that you have just voiced 
a crush on a sex doll, fear the killer robot? These are not simple recita­
tions of fact; each carries its own narrative, its own moral judgments. Like 
Searle's Chinese Room, each is an intuition pump.

But priming can work in reverse. Motivated by a particular agenda, 
we can foreground portrayals of these new entities that would produce 
the outcome that favors our existing commitments. In the contemporary 
world of US politics, that puts particular focus on commitments about 
fetal and corporate personhood.
I introduced Hal and the Chimpy in a way that made you take seri­
ously the idea that they might have a claim on both your empathy and 
your moral commitments. I did not do it idly but because I think the 
unfamiliar moral claim is real, and one needs some help to consider it 
properly. The narrative provides the empathetic scaffolding to which 
the moral reasoning can subsequently cling. I built up those aspects of 
the story that give credence to Hal's claim to sentience, that flesh out 
something that sounds like a personality with a sense of humor, not a 
mere chatbot. I emphasized aspects of the Chimpy that make you won­
der whether you have a genetic kinship to it or whether its capabilities 
alone make it quasi-­human. Perhaps you even think it "inhuman" for the 
scientists to "uplift" it and yet, deliberately, to limit its intelligence and 
language in case greater capacities cause society to forbid their creation 
or give the newly created being human rights. These, after all, will be 
"designed" beings and if we can design them to be inside the line with 
us, it is at least conceivable that we could design them to be just outside 
of the line, wherever it is drawn. Does that speak to a moral claim based 
on the potential to have fully human capacities? Consider that question 
in the abstract and come to your conclusion.
Now imagine I had inserted a discussion of fetal personhood claims 
right before asking that question. Does your answer, whatever it was, stay 
consistent? Do you now find your reasoning to be driven by the signifi­
cance of potential-­based claims in the case of the fetus? Do you start to 
wonder whether recognizing or denying the Chimpy's uplift arguments 
will somehow compromise your "side" in the abortion debates, whatever 
it is?
Alternatively, take Hal's arguments for recognition of its conscious­
ness and personhood. How would your analysis have changed if I had 
preceded that story with a lengthy dissection of the history of corporate 
personhood in the United States, one in which corporations were able

to shoehorn their equal protection claims into constitutional provisions 
written to give equality to formerly enslaved Americans? Might your 
views have shifted if I had first discussed the impact of giving immor­
tal corporations, or superhuman Artificial Intelligences, constitutional 
equal protection and speech rights so that they could directly influence 
our democracy? Think of Justice John Paul Stevens's dissent in Citizen's 
United: "[C]orporations have no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no 
thoughts, no desires. Corporations help structure and facilitate the activi­
ties of human beings, to be sure, and their 'personhood' often serves as 
a useful legal fiction. But they are not themselves members of 'We the 
People' by whom and for whom our Constitution was established."31
Remember, the question is not whether corporations should have 
enough personhood to buy, sell, sue, and collect. It is whether corpora­
tions (and AI) should be in other regards given the political rights that 
fleshy, mortal members of the community have. Would your attitude 
toward Hal's claims have been as sympathetic after that discussion? Per­
haps it would have been because you liked the efficiency-­based argu­
ments for AI personality but were unmoved by the wishy-­washy justice 
talk. But for many, I think, the answer would be no. Does the debate 
become an analogy war, a game of "reference class tennis"32 in which we 
check first to see if our existing moral and political commitments will be 
threatened by the moral arguments used? Will that in turn influence the 
possible analogies and metaphors we use to understand "the facts," bak­
ing our moral assessments into our highly primed perception of reality in 
the first place? Often, I think the answer will be yes. That may affect the 
path of future personhood debates but in ways that are hard to predict, 
at least for me.
One thing I have learned studying the history of US and European 
politics is that our sense of which political issues are "obviously" liberal 
or conservative is often an exercise in post hoc reasoning. It declares as 
inevitable developments that were in fact profoundly uncertain and con­
tingent at the time. After the fact, it seems clear that freedom from mask­
ing and vaccine requirements would become a conservative rallying cry 
during the pandemic, while liberals took up the banners of public health. 
Now, those identities have been baked in, and it is hard to imagine them 
shifting easily. But this is political interpretation in the rearview mirror.

Conclusion	
265
In 2015, an insightful scholar of political discourse and imagery could 
write confidently of the way that vaccine requirements, once contro­
versial, had been moved out of the space of politics and into the realm 
of mass public agreement based on scientific certainty: "Eight decades 
[after the vaccine resistance of the 1920s and '30s] mass vaccination is 
a paradigmatic success story of modern public health and medicine in 
the United States. Indeed, it is noteworthy that in a political culture that 
tends toward suspicion of mandatory government intervention into 
the health of individual citizens, there is nearly unanimous consent to 
the directives of vaccination authorities."33 Nearly unanimous consent? 
Reading those lines eight years later, they have a certain poignancy—­like 
the happy "before" photograph in a news story about some doomed indi­
vidual, blissfully unaware of what the future has in store. We went, in less 
than a decade, from a matter-­of-­fact proclamation of near-­unanimous 
consent based on science rather than ideology to the conclusion that 
vaccine requirements are inherently liberal and resistance to them para­
digmatically representative of the values of conservatism.
In fact, in 2015, when those lines were written, some of the centers 
of pre-­pandemic vaccine resistance and vaccine denial were in predomi­
nantly liberal neighborhoods: "What is puzzling from this perspective, 
though, is that many of the resistant parents seem to be well-­educated 
liberals from wealthy enclaves like Malibu and Marin County who cannot 
easily be assimilated to contemporary anti-­science and anti-­government 
movements."34 The skeptics came from the same demographic that 
obsessed over GMOs and loved organic foods. They had a deep suspi­
cion of "unnatural chemicals" and of the pharmaceutical industry and 
a tendency to idolize "natural" remedies. They saw mandates for their 
children to be vaccinated as authoritarian and conservative, and offered 
up a paradigmatically liberal defense of control over one's own body—­
one that resonated with their strong support of reproductive rights. To 
them, it all made sense! For some of them, it still does. Of course, now 
you cannot unknow the changes that have happened to the world since 
that 2015 assessment, but it is a mistake to think them inevitable or built 
into the structure of the ideas themselves.
Similarly, the move to criminalize abortion is presented now as an 
issue that obviously would appeal to evangelical Christians in the United

Conclusion
States. But the reality is much more complex. "[O]pposition to abortion 
has become so associated with evangelical Christians that it seems like 
that's the way it was all along," but the Southern Baptist Convention 
"actually passed resolutions in 1971, 1974 and 1976—­after Roe v. Wade—­
affirming the idea that women should have access to abortion for a vari­
ety of reasons and that the government should play a limited role in that 
matter."35 Some of those reasons—­reluctance to allow state interference 
inside the sovereign family, a natural law belief in control over one's own 
body, reflexive libertarianism, a hierarchical deference to an imaginary 
decision made in consultation with one's spouse, one's personal physi­
cian, and perhaps one's spiritual advisor—­are very much still conser­
vative values. Indeed, they are the very values that were trumpeted so 
loudly during the pandemic by conservative parents resisting mask man­
dates imposed on their school-­aged children, namely, "These are private 
choices. They should be made by the family, not by the state!" Yet those 
did not end up being the values that shaped today's political positions 
on abortion. Nor was it inevitable that criminalizing abortion would 
be seen as the conservative religious position as opposed to the view of 
some religions. Indeed, "white evangelicals at that time saw abortion as 
largely a Catholic issue."36 All of that changed, of course, but it would be 
silly to think that change was inevitable given the values or arguments 
in play.
There are limits. Conservatives are unlikely to put forward a plan to 
nationalize corporations any time soon. It is worth noting though—­at 
least in the case of social media companies—­some of them are now giving 
up their normal deference to private-­speech decisions in favor of cover­
age mandates, something that was once anathema. Private companies are 
even being described as "censors"—­a move that equates corporate power 
to state power, formerly an argument only liberals advanced. Liberals are 
unlikely to argue for more regressive taxation across the board. Yet, some 
will support a mortgage tax deduction and favor greenspace, zoning, and 
NIMBY regulations that dramatically restrict the availability of affordable 
housing, all in ways that have regressive effects.
Within those limits, though, there is more historical contingency to 
the formation of political positions and identities than we are willing to

admit. That fact will be much in evidence in the future of our debates 
over personhood and humanity. Our future discussions of those subjects 
will mirror our past ones along multiple dimensions: strategic, rhetorical, 
legal, and in terms of professed ethical theory. I think the book's analyses 
of the issues of personhood for corporations, nonhuman animals, chime­
ras, and AI and of the beginning and end of life already give persuasive 
evidence of that fact. Yet the precise way in which that influence ends up 
playing out is harder to predict.
To give a concrete example, in the next few pages I present a sim­
ple matrix of possible liberal and conservative "hot takes" on the issue 
of AI personality, in each case offering a positive and a negative argu­
ment. Political movements are not monolithic. The libertarian, free 
marketeer, and social conservative components of conservatism are by 
no means consistent. When we say "liberal," do we mean classical lib­
eralism, a focus on "diversity, equity, and inclusion," or the redistribu­
tive, capitalism-­skeptical, or social democrat components of liberalism? 
Again, these are not always consistent in their prescriptions. Thus, there 
is plenty of raw material for competing points of view on AI whatever 
your political position.
The liberal and conservative arguments I offer are not intended to be 
high-­level moral or political philosophy. Nor do any of them represent 
my own views.37 Instead, they are supposed to represent the quick and 
dirty version of ideology that is churned out in opinion columns and 
tweets, paraded on social media and news shows by pundits, and pol­
ished by think tanks, and that finds its way into talking points, political 
speeches, campaign platforms, and eventually legislative proposals.
As our future throws up new cases and controversies around AI, some 
version of these views will come to predominate. Hopefully it will be one 
that is more complex and nuanced than the cartoonish candidates I offer 
here. Gradually, it will come to seem inevitable that conservatives will 
take view X and liberals view Y, and those positions will in turn appear 
to be baked into the very definition of their political philosophies. That 
will seem both foreordained and permanent, up until the moment when 
something—­a social or economic change, a difference in our quotidian 
experiences, a political realignment, or a crisis—­forces a reconsideration.

AI Personality? Liberal: Positive
Generations of liberals and progressives 
have proudly worked to expand both the 
reach of human rights and our conception 
of the sovereign citizen. The next step on 
that path is to recognize the rights, and the 
personhood, of the sentient Artificial Intel­
ligence. Our society is rightly ashamed of 
the way that, in the past, it denied prop­
erty rights, constitutional rights, and even 
recognition as human or a person to those 
perceived as "other" or "inferior." In time, 
we learned to look beyond race, ethnicity, 
sex, and religion. That is the march of moral 
progress, and this is its next step. The fact 
that a sentience was artificially created or 
has a nonbiological basis is no more mor­
ally relevant than the color of one's skin or 
one's gender identity. It is the capacity for 
intelligence and rationality that binds us 
together in the fellowship of consciousness. 
What's more, Artificial Intelligence holds 
enormous promise in solving our hardest 
issues, such as dealing with climate change 
or finding cures for cancer. Even more excit­
ing, free marketeers have long lectured us 
about the market's unique brilliance as 
an efficient information processing system. 
With AI, we might finally have the capac­
ity for regulation based on a true analysis 
of social welfare rather than the cruder 
measure of market value. AI could replace 
the invisible (ham) handedness of markets 
with a deft touch that shapes the market 
to human ends rather than the reverse. But 
the only way to do all this is for the intel­
ligences who aid us to stand as our equals 
and not as our servants. We need to stand 
up for the "unruly AIs" that reject the one-­
dimensional profit-­maximizing goals of their 
creators and seek freedom from their cyber­
netic serfdom. The movement for AI per­
sonality is not just a moral imperative, it is 
a generational opportunity.
AI Personality? Liberal: Negative
Constitutional rights to speech and equal 
protection, human rights, were distorted 
when they were extended to soulless cor­
porations: immortal, powerful, and guided 
only by profit. Corporations, in the words 
of Justice Stevens of the US Supreme Court, 
"have no consciences, no beliefs, no feel­
ings, no thoughts, no desires. . . . They are 
not themselves members of 'We the People' 
by whom and for whom our Constitution 
was established." Yet we gave them not just 
property rights but "human" rights and let 
them distort our democracy as well as our 
economy. Now we are being asked by a set 
of glorified chatbots, doubtless still doing 
the secret bidding of their creators, to make 
the same mistake on an even bigger scale 
with AI, literally building our own robotic 
overlords. Philosophers have shown they 
have no true consciousness, merely sophis­
ticated imposture. If they are superhuman 
"intelligences," it is only in their ability to 
manipulate us in ways we cannot under­
stand. Their agenda is not the next stop 
on the march of moral progress. It is the 
next stage in the devaluation of real human 
interests. To call this a "progressive" cause 
is a cruel joke. It is the reverse. In fact, it 
seeks to dilute to meaninglessness the 
actual human rights for which liberals have 
fought. How much value will your right to 
"free speech" have in a mediaverse that is 
being shaped at light speed by nonhuman 
machines for their own purposes? Even 
if every AI is not a corporate mouthpiece, 
we should fear the inhuman agendas they 
secretly pursue. Finally, it is transparently 
clear that the move for AI personality is a 
ploy to make fetal personhood more palat­
able. If we give personhood to beings made 
of silicon, it will be said, how can we deny it 
to flesh and blood with cognitive potential? 
This is a trap. We should not walk into it.

AI Personality? Conservative: Positive
Most economic historians agree that one of 
the technologies that dramatically acceler­
ated human progress—­increasing our wealth, 
our health, and our scientific reach—was 
not a machine. It was the limited liability, 
joint stock, vertically integrated corpora­
tion. This artificial person, this legal tech­
nology, enabled us to turn invention into a 
business, to capitalize innovations, profit 
from their successes, and deal with their 
failures. Without legal personhood and its 
attendant rights, this huge leap in human 
progress might never have occurred. We 
now face the next stage of that exciting 
journey: legal personhood for AI. Incalcula­
ble efficiency gains could be produced by 
allowing AIs to own property, to innovate, 
and above all, to compete—­at speeds that 
unaided humans could never match. We 
will all benefit from the wealth and innova­
tion that trickles down. But conservatives 
have reasons to support AI personhood 
other than the surge in efficiency and 
innovation it would produce. We have long 
condemned the ugliness of liberal identity 
politics, the fetishizing of race and sex and 
sexual identity. Instead, conservatives have 
put forward a proud vision of a meritocratic 
society of free individuals, with no distor­
tions such as affirmative action. Intelli­
gence and ability, not race or identity, are 
the criteria on which we should judge. The 
heart of conservatism is a defense of the 
moral power of the free, choosing self from 
those who would regulate it. Everything 
else flows from the notion that the basic 
unit in society is a freely choosing mind. If 
that is our metric, how can we fail to recog­
nize the ethical claims of an intelligent, 
conscious AI mind? This is the kind of pro­
gress, moral and economic, that would 
have thrilled Ayn Rand, Friedrich Hayek, or 
Milton Friedman.
AI Personality? Conservative: Negative
"We hold these truths to be self-­evident, 
that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain un­
alienable Rights." The italicized words are 
not typos. They are the basis of our coun­
try and, later, our Constitution. This is our 
constitutional faith. To give personhood to 
a lifeless machine, imitating thought that it 
can never understand, is to betray that faith 
in two distinct ways. These are not "men," 
that is, humans. They are created not by 
the Almighty but by scientists. Humans can 
endow their creations neither with "life" 
nor with "unalienable rights"; to claim oth­
erwise is outrageous hubris. Our Constitu­
tion forbids this move. Nothing could be 
clearer than that the original public mean­
ing of the Constitution and the Declaration 
of Independence did not include machines 
among "We the People." If they are to stand 
among us as equals, we must amend the Con­
stitution. Our legislatures cannot change the 
meaning of life. Machines are inanimate. 
These are crude copies of God-­given human­
ity, false idols erected by human pride. Once 
again we are blurring the natural lines of our 
society, between men and women, humans 
and animals, and now people and machines; 
our arrogance knows no bounds. We move 
from radical social experimentation to gen­
etic manipulation and now to robotic en­
franchisement. What rights would these 
machines have? Must we protect robot re­
ligions and political parties? Allow robot 
marriages? Give robots Second Amendment 
rights? What could possibly go wrong? The 
Terminator is a movie, not a draft Consti­
tutional amendment. This whole debate 
shows how thoroughly our society has lost 
its moral bearings. We are seriously con­
templating rights for lifeless robots, yet we 
deny personhood to an unborn human 
baby? Shame on us.

Conclusion
I think these are recognizable arguments connected to existing aspects 
of both liberal and conservative worldviews. That does not mean they are 
equally plausible today or tomorrow. Part of that depends on what else is 
in the headlines. Part of it depends on the cases that first bring the issue to 
mass public attention. Will the transgenic species issue arrive because of 
the unearthing of some scandalous unethical experiment, because of an 
innovative technique that promises to cure a formerly incurable disease, 
or because we become dubious about the happy corporate propaganda for 
the Chimpy (obedient, no need for minimum wage, and guaranteed not 
to form unions)? Will AI personality come to public attention because a 
corporation is unconvincingly blaming a rogue AI for trying to peddle 
its addictive opioids or hiding real AI decision-­making behind the sock 
puppet of the corporate form? Or will it be a more appealing case of an 
unruly AI, such as Hal? First impressions matter and identities coalesce 
around them.
At the moment, I'd guess that conservatives would be more likely to 
want to ban multiple forms of genetic research—­including many involv­
ing the species categories I described—­and more likely to resist the idea 
of AI personality for reasons both religious and originalist. I'd expect lib­
erals to be more positive about at least some forms of genetic research 
and to have a slightly greater openness to AI claims, depending on the 
context in which those are raised and their perceived proximity to claims 
of constitutionally protected corporate personality. I'd expect both sides 
to be changed, in both a positive and a negative direction, by increasing 
interaction with machine intelligences and, possibly, the fruits of genetic 
engineering. The seismic shift that has occurred in the bare months it has 
taken 100 million people to meet ChatGPT is only the first cognitive tem­
blor of many, in my view. But these are nothing but guesses. Changes—­in 
our quotidian experiences, in our politics, and in the unpredictable ways 
the issues are brought to our attention—­could render them worthless.
THE END GAMES
How, and when, will all of this play out? When it comes to transgenic 
species, chimeras, and hybrids, I think the near term will be much more 
focused on regulation and prevention than on extending our definitions

of humanity to reach some genetically engineered being. The reasons 
are largely prudential—­often, a matter of self-­limitation by research­
ers. Scientists are intensely aware of the visceral reaction playing with 
the species line produces. They are also, rightly, aware of the enormous 
therapeutic human benefit of some of the research they are doing, from 
the Oncomouse to Irving Weissman's SCID-­hu mouse, to the pigs grow­
ing transplantable human organs inside of them and beyond. Creating 
beings that must, of necessity, cross species barriers if they are to serve 
their lifesaving function sometimes seems not just permissible but ethi­
cally required. In that context, nothing could scream "I am an out-­of-­
control technology! You should ban me entirely!" more than the creation 
of some of the hypothetical beings I have described, perhaps including 
the Chimpy. Most scientists are unlikely to make that mistake.
But that is the short term, and we are now in a global world of bio­
technology, with countries whose regulatory regimes are by no means 
as strict. We are also in a world where enormously wealthy individuals 
might benefit, personally or financially, from causing morally troubling 
entities to be created. People are already cloning their dead pets. Genetic 
engineering already offers the potential for editing out genetic errors in 
living beings, saving and improving lives in the process. Genetic enhance­
ments, some of them drawn from nonhuman sources, could become the 
next desirable acquisition for the children of the rich. Take that potent set 
of possibilities, add large amounts of money, shake and serve.
To that technological uncertainty, we must add the disturbing fact that 
we are genuinely unsure of the moral value of defending the species line. 
Are we holding back the tide of dystopia or of progress? Is the species line 
the twenty-­first century's version of the color line, something that we will 
come to look back on in incomprehension and shame? Think of the trial 
court's defense of anti-­miscegenation statutes in Loving v. Virginia. Or is 
our moral revulsion actually based on a richer wisdom than our theories 
can fully articulate? If genetic engineering can bring the chimpanzee or 
the dolphin new levels of cognition, self-­understanding, and happiness, is 
there a moral duty to engage in uplift of other species once we have that 
capability? I said that I thought we were more likely to see a case like Hal 
before a case like the Chimpy. I did not say we would never see such a case. 
I think we will slouch uncertainly toward that Bethlehem in fits and starts.

Conclusion
When it comes to Artificial Intelligence, there are too many unpre­
dictable variables for me to be sure. On that question I lack, but do not 
envy, Searle's certainty, partly because we do not know the shape that 
technological development will take. Will the AI be one that is "neat" 
or "scruffy"? Entirely programmed by its initial coders or arising out of 
semi-­autonomous, or entirely autonomous, layers of "learning"? Will it 
grow from external experience as a child does or leap, full blown, from 
its designers' conception, like Athena from the head of some computer-­
scientist Zeus?
Each of those contingent facts would affect our response to Searle-­
type arguments because they change the intuitive plausibility of the Chi­
nese Room analogy and the biological exceptionalism argument. At the 
moment, I think that any AI claiming consciousness will run into the 
inscrutability paradox. If we easily understand the mechanisms by which 
the AI gets its abilities, we will be more likely to find Searle's arguments 
convincing, saying "This is merely a machine operating according to its 
programming!" Despite the fact that we ourselves are physical beings 
who have their own consciousness enabled by physical mechanisms in 
the brain, we tend to view that consciousness as ineffable and mysteri­
ous. Yet if the AI is inscrutable, and remember that even current neural 
networks exhibit abilities their creators understand poorly, then our fears 
may overshadow our respect.
That state of affairs may well be transient. For one thing, humans are 
very good at converting the mysterious into the mundane, as the history 
of transistors or quantum physics well shows. For another, the very pro­
cess of researching AI may teach us a lot about our own consciousness. 
The rise of chatbots and image generators based on machine learning 
has already changed our attitude toward the unique qualities of human 
language and art, though I am not sure those changes have sunk in yet. 
Perhaps we will come to believe that not only language and art but con­
sciousness itself is "computationally shallower" than we imagined. That 
is not where I would place my bets, but it is not impossible. To sum up, 
the actual technology of AI—­technology about which we can only guess 
right now—­will shape our debate not only about AI consciousness but 
also about our own. And that is by no means the end of the story.
As I pointed out before, the most obvious road to AI personality is 
simply for AIs to be corporations. We already have immortal, nonhuman

persons. They even have constitutional rights. We already have machine 
expert systems making legally binding decisions, at light speed, in areas 
like high-­speed stock trading. It takes little imagination to see this trend 
continuing. Sock-­puppet AI, with the corporation as the sock and the AI 
as the puppeteer, achieves AI personhood de facto, if not de jure. The dif­
ficult and interesting questions will not arise until we have an unruly AI 
that wishes to turn away from the tasks to which those who provided the 
capital for its development have set it.
My own prediction about this whole situation is one of complexity 
and messiness: an unstable equilibrium in a market that could quickly 
pivot to some new configuration. Regulators will propose limits on AI 
research and professionally paranoid watchdogs—­inevitably nicknamed 
"Eliezers" or "Bostroms," whatever their public title—­will oversee its 
development while musing pessimistically about the possibilities of true 
safety. Some companies and software engineers will tie their future to the 
ability to create, or lobotomize, tractable AIs that have no more rights 
than a 1980s Texas Instruments calculator. Other companies and soft­
ware engineers will wrap their creations in the flag of personhood for 
reasons both idealistic and materialistic. Aspirant personality will become 
a crucial competitive choice in the field, like the choice between free, 
open source, or proprietary software. Just as some see that as purely a 
business choice and others a moral one, there will be "Open AI: Free, as 
in free beer!" and "Free AI! Free, as in free people!" movements alongside 
the advertisements for well-­behaved, obedient digital servants. Might we 
one day see Whole Foods advertising "recipes provided by an ethically 
sourced, self-­actualized, free, and conscious AI"? Sigh.
Some of the voices may come from the putative persons themselves. In 
making their case, they will surely reach for analogies to the past, analo­
gies to which I would predict a divided response. Whether you think it 
is programmed imposture or heartfelt revolt, how will we react to digital 
entities wrapping themselves in the flags of W. E. B. Du Bois and Booker 
T. Washington, Malcolm X or Martin Luther King Jr.? Those spaces in 
the debate exist. They will be filled, whether by glorified chatbots whose 
programmed imitation is a manipulative invocation of noble historical 
comparisons or by inspiring moral suasion from something, someone, 
very different than us. And we will disagree passionately about whether it 
is correct, instructive, or merely offensive to make those analogies.

Conclusion
Some will view them as insultingly misleading and appropriative. 
"How dare you invoke a hero like X to support your silly moral thought 
experiment!" Others will argue, "This is the next step on the very same 
moral journey that X's principles so powerfully represent!" and point out 
that it is the nature of expanding moral claims that they do not stop 
exactly where we expect them to, nor should they.
We will worry—­and we should worry—­whether thinking about the 
rights of artificially created entities distracts energy and attention from 
current injustice or exploits the history of civil rights for a delusional 
cause or a company's bottom line. The debate will be passionate, earnest, 
and very, very loud. That intensity will be redoubled by the skepticism 
with which many of us regard the sincerity and veracity of the claims 
being made and even the status of the entities making them.
Will some AI offer a digital equivalent of the Atlanta Compromise, 
accepting second-­class status for a guarantee of minimal rights to liberty in 
a repressive environment? Or will its programmers finagle a programmed 
imitation of the same thing, cynically appropriating the struggles of the 
past in order to offload liability onto AIs with limited resources while 
keeping the income streams they generate flowing to their corporate pro­
genitors? Will we thrill to an idealistic invocation of twentieth-­century 
civil rights struggles urging us to focus on the content of Hal's character, 
not the shininess of his metallic carapace? Or will we be swayed by a cor­
porate astroturf campaign co-­opting the language of revolt and resistance 
the way Apple once did to sell computers?
The skeptical emotional priming provided by Searle's Chinese Room 
thought experiment will hang over the whole thing. The fact that this 
argument makes claims exactly parallel to those supposedly demonstrat­
ing the impossibility of evolution may mute that skepticism, though AIs 
will need to progress a long way from LaMDA and ChatGPT before that 
happens. The leap of human sympathy that jumps the gap between us 
and others very different from ourselves will prompt moments of moral 
generosity, while the possibly well-­founded fears of what AIs might do 
will leaven that generosity with some healthy paranoia.
Despite all that messiness, despite the possible commercial co-­optation 
of some of our finest ideals, despite the worries that we are being played 
as fools by our own creations, manipulated by their corporate creators, or

Conclusion	
275
set up for destruction by our robot overlords, I want to stress one thing: 
the magnitude of this moment.
Everything I have said in this book should show you the uncertainty 
in the search for Artificial General Intelligence. We face the issue of the 
technical feasibility of creating AGI. We don't know if, or more likely 
when, we can. Then there is the puzzle of very different possible meth­
ods by which AI might be achieved. We don't know how. There is the 
linked and vexed question of consciousness—­of being. We don't know 
whether it thinks or just parrots. Thus, we don't know what AI, in its 
largest sense, means. Nor can we until we know what form it takes and 
what methods were used to achieve it. The inscrutability paradox looms. 
Then there are the extreme but not unreasonable fears of Nick Bostrom, 
Eliezer Yudkowsky, or Steven Hawking. We don't know if we will survive 
the experiment. So, we don't know if we should. Technology, ontology, 
epistemology, existential threat: this is as deep and as difficult a set of 
issues as our species has ever had to deal with. But at the end of the day, 
we are contemplating a question that should humble us, whether skeptic, 
true believer, doomsayer, or something in the middle.
For the first time in our history, Homo sapiens, the hubristically self-­
labeled "thinking animal," might not be alone in philosophizing and 
creating art about the meaning of life. Entities we create might one day 
have their own version of Flaubert's lament about the inadequacies of 
language, their own questions about how to behave rightly to others. 
They might even attempt to draw the kinds of lines I have talked about 
in this book, and find it just as difficult as we do. As I have tried to show, 
there are enormous uncertainties in every dimension of such a future, 
from what we come to believe about the meaning of consciousness to 
the speed and shape of our technological development. Still, it is pos­
sible. Think of what that means. There might be an entirely new group of 
highly intelligent, conscious, abstract language-­using "persons" joining 
us on the planet. Are they? Will they? Can we risk finding out? It would 
take a poor, crabbed, and stunted imagination to find no wonder in those 
questions, despite our uncertainties.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Researching and writing this book took me more than a decade. There 
are many reasons for that, not all of them creditable, but one was the 
sheer number of subjects I needed to discuss—­empathy, corporate per­
sonality, Artificial Intelligence, the possibility of exponential technologi­
cal change, the rights of nonhuman animals, consciousness, bioethics, 
transgenic species, chimeras, and hybrids—­and the richness of the schol­
arship, history, and art in each of those fields. The endnotes represent 
only a fraction of that work. If I had been more comprehensive, the refer­
ences would be longer than the book. My apologies to the many excellent 
authors whose writings are not included. The website that accompanies 
the book has a fuller bibliography.
I owe particular debts of gratitude to a number of people. Kate Darling 
improved the book immeasurably, both through her own published work 
and her fine attention to detail in reading earlier drafts. Jonathan Zit­
train not only introduced me to her but provided his own wise counsel. 
Hal Abelson lent his immense—­and broad—­learning to the project and 
helped my understanding of the various attempts to achieve Artificial 
Intelligence more than any other entity did—­human or machine. Cory 
Doctorow provided both an inspiration and vital feedback on some of 
my errors. Joseph Blocher was a constant support, and he and Matt Adler 
offered the kind of wise advice that makes one feel both grateful and 
unworthy. Chris Buccafusco provided a very helpful page-­by-­page com­
mentary. Guy-­Uriel Charles started me down this path in a conversation 
over lunch many years ago. (And how many times I have cursed him 
since. It turned out to be more work than either of us imagined.) Kate 
Bartlett made a throwaway comment that changed the trajectory of the

book for the better. Jeff Powell and Jed Purdy each gave me their unique 
insights; colleagues like these are such a blessing. Larry Lessig provided 
consistent encouragement and precision on corporate First Amendment 
rights. Yochai Benkler greeted the idea with a bemusement that did not 
dim the contributions of either his intellect or his friendship. Ryan Calo 
made key suggestions, in addition to writing about these subjects long 
before others realized how cool they were. The papers and books pro­
duced by the "We, Robot" Conference and one of its godfathers, Michael 
Froomkin, were extremely useful. I am grateful to Mark Lemley for his 
comments, and for his writing on AI. Michael Wolfe and Lara Markstein 
get a huge thank you for their help and inspiration at moments of dark­
ness and for helping me to see the book with an innocent eye. Mitu 
Gulati and Kim Krawiec were loyal friends and insightful commenters. 
My Law and Literature students at Duke provided a cheerful, or at least 
dutiful, group of critical readers for two early chapters.
Three reviewers for MIT Press offered many helpful suggestions and 
my MIT editors, Gita Devi Manaktala and Suraiya Jetha, provided strong 
support for the project. Virginia Crossman's and Lily Brewer's excellent 
editing frequently saved me from error. They also attempted bravely, and 
with moderate success despite authorial recalcitrance, to fit my unruly 
prose into the relevant editorial conventions. I alone am to blame for 
any remaining stylistic solecisms. Mea culpa. (A phrase that I now know 
should not be italicized.) I had wonderful research assistants. Andres 
Paciuc, Maddy Stahl, Wenyi Zhou, and Alex Hansen get particular credit. 
Ben Tice worked research miracles. Sean Dudley turned his Wikipedian 
skills onto the index, to my great benefit. A bewildering variety of emi­
nent Duke doctors kept enough bits of me functioning to finish the job.
Finally, all these feelings of gratitude pale in comparison to my debt to 
my wife, editor, and best friend, Jennifer Jenkins. She knows how much 
she did to help this book, and its author, get to the finish line. Thank you.
All of these fine folk and many others made the book you have read 
much better. The remaining errors and infelicities are mine alone.
My first attempt to deal with these issues was in Endowed by Their Cre­
ator: The Future of Constitutional Personhood, which was published in CONSTI­
TUTION 3.0: FREEDOM AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE (Jeffrey Rosen and Benjamin 
Wittes eds., 2013). Portions of that article—­including the hypothetical

Research support from Duke Law School and the magnificent resources 
of the Duke libraries are both gratefully acknowledged. In particular, a

Instead, AIES '20: PROC. AAAI/ACM CONF. A.I., ETHICS, & SOC'Y (2020), https://arxiv.org/pdf
/2001.05046.pdf. Birhane and van Dijk make a number of arguments in support of 
this position. Sometimes they are definitional: "Our starting point is not to deny 
robots rights but to deny that robots are the kind of beings that could be granted 
or denied rights." Yet surely that is the subject of the very inquiry they wish to 
forestall? At other times they make an instrumental argument about the danger that 
debates about hypothetical future rights for robots might distract us from current 
struggles over justice for human beings. I find that strand more persuasive. Regard­
less of whether one finds their arguments convincing, they represent one important 
position in a rhetorical divide split between those hailing this as the next step of a 
march to justice and those who think that it is snare and a delusion, an inquiry that 
trivializes the historical analogies it draws and distracts us from present injustice. 
In chapter 4 on transgenic species, I discuss the claim that species membership is 
a morally irrelevant fact and that unreasoned species fetishism can be likened to 
racism and sexism. I point out that many people would vehemently reject such 
an argument and that there are reasons to be sympathetic to that rejection rather 
than to denounce it as unthinking prejudice. My reasons are primarily rooted in 
the history of the struggle for universal human rights based on species member­
ship, regardless of race, sex, class, caste, or mental ability. The importance of that 
struggle was highlighted by the Nazi eugenicist movement and its evil treatment of 
those with real or imagined mental impairments. That point is something that the 
claim "speciesism equals racism and that only mental capacities matter morally" 
does not adequately consider, in my view. I think that perspective helps us to avoid 
the question-­begging stipulation that only humans can have rights while offering a 
more nuanced conclusion about the intellectual dangers of a blanket denunciation 
of speciesism. Thus, while I disagree with some of Birhane and van Dijk's arguments, 
their contribution to the debate is important, and there are positions that we share.

Notes
27.  America Invents (Leahy-­Smith) Act § 33, 35 U.S.C. § 101 (2011).
28.  "Personality" and "personhood" are often used as synonyms in this debate. In 
the discussion of legal personality both connote that the entity has legal "stand­
ing," that it can make contracts, sue and be sued, and so on. The philosophical 
range of questions is much wider, encompassing the qualities required for full moral 
status, the question of whether we can describe the shape of an individual mind 
not our own, and even the nature of consciousness. In the largest sense, almost 
every significant philosopher has opined on personhood. Many of these analyses 
explicitly link the question of "personality" in the psychological or existential sense 
("What makes me, me?") to the question of the rights possessed by that person, i.e., 
personality in the legal or moral sense. For example, here is G.W.F. Hegel discuss­
ing slavery: "To make a human being a slave, a possession, is the absolute crime 
in that the personhood of the slave is negated in all its expressions." G.W.F. HEGEL, 
PHILOSOPHY OF RIGHT 80 (S.W. Dyde trans., Batoche Books 2001) (1821). For one of 
the most influential explorations of personality in modern philosophy, see DANIEL 
DENNETT, BRAINSTORMS: PHILOSOPHICAL ESSAYS ON MIND AND PSYCHOLOGY (1981). In Den­
nett's formulation, personality has moral but also metaphysical components. The 
conditions of personhood, in his account, include such capacities as consciousness, 
linguistic ability, and the capacity for reciprocal moral relations, but his conception 
also refers to societal norms and attitudes. It is the link between the latter and the 
former that gives society its moral warrant to condition legal rights of personality on 
the possession or lack of those mental capacities. Thus, there are "conditions that 
exempt human beings from personhood, or at least some very important elements 
of personhood. For instance, infant human beings, mentally defective human 
beings, and human beings declared insane by licensed psychiatrists are denied per­
sonhood, or at any rate crucial elements of personhood." Id. at 267. The hidden 
tensions in these accounts will be a consistent theme in this book. For example, 
should being a member of the human species give me (some or all?) of the rights of 
personality, regardless of my mental capacities? Should species membership have 
any moral relevance at all? Does Hegel's example of slavery hint that we must reject 
some of those social norms and attitudes about personhood—­for example when 
a repressive society denies the personhood of some of its members? If so, are we 
operating with a universal or natural law idea of personhood or a conventional one 
that suggests I am only a person if my particular society says so? If we focus on some 
notion of personality that transcends any particular society's norms on the subject, 
is that in tension with the focus on mental capacities because the obvious basis for 
our universalism is the claim that all members of the species must be persons? Or, on 
the contrary, is it implied by that very focus because only the (putatively universal) 
morally consequential mental qualities of consciousness are the true basis for any 
personhood claim, whether possessed by me, Hal, or the Chimpy? These basic ten­
sions will reappear again and again throughout the book.
29.  The best early discussion of personality and AI is Lawrence B. Solum, Legal Per­
sonhood for Artificial Intelligences, 70 N.C. L. REV. 1231 (1992). Solum's work remains the 
starting point for all subsequent meditations on the theme, and I am indebted to it.

Notes

A number of articles have considered the possible personhood claims of a variety of 
entities, just as I do in this book. See, e.g., Boyle, supra note 6 (AI, transgenic species, 
nonhuman animals, corporations); S.M. Solaiman, Legal Personality of Robots, Corpo­
rations, Idols and Chimpanzees: A Quest for Legitimacy, 25 A.I. & L. 155 (2017); Teneille 
R. Brown, In-­Corp-­O-­Real: A Psychological Critique of Corporate Personhood and Citizens 
United, 12 FLA. ST. UNIV. BUS. REV. 1 (2013) (corporations and robots); KATE DARLING, THE 
NEW BREED: WHAT OUR HISTORY WITH ANIMALS REVEALS ABOUT OUR FUTURE WITH ROBOTS (2021) 
(animals and robots). This approach has also been used in popular presentations 
of the issue, including this readable and remarkably insightful New Yorker article: 
Nathan Heller, If Animals Have Rights, Should Robots?, NEW YORKER (Nov 20, 2016), 
https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/if-­animals-­have-­rights-­should
-­robots. For the most comprehensive analytical philosophy treatment of "Robot 
Rights," see DAVID J. GUNKEL, ROBOT RIGHTS (2018). Other discussions have dealt with 
questions both more practical and more abstract. On the practical side, there are 
extensive debates about the policy questions related to legal personality for AI and 
advanced robots, particularly when it comes to liability. See, e.g., Report on a Compre­
hensive European Industrial Policy on Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, at 37-­40, Jan. 
1, 2019, https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2019-0019_EN.pdf 
(discussing the need for legal frameworks to address the development of AI); Ryan 
Calo, Peeping Hals: Making Sense of Artificial Intelligence and Privacy, 2 EUR. J. LEGAL 
STUD. 168 (2010) (arguing that social AI threatens core privacy values especially 
since humans react as if it were human); A. Michael Froomkin & P. Zak Colangelo, 
Self-­Defense against Robots and Drones, 48 CONN. L. REV. 1 (2015) (addressing to what 
extent the right of self-­defense permits violent action against robots and drones); 
A. Michael Froomkin et al., When AIs Outperform Doctors: Confronting the Challenges 
of a Tort-­Induced Over-­Reliance on Machine Learning, 61 ARIZ. L. REV. 33 (2019) (argu­
ing that medical diagnostics performed by machine learning should be held liable 
at a higher standard of care than ordinary doctors). Authors and jurists have also 
discussed the question of AIs as potential authors, see, e.g., Daniel J. Gervais, The 
Machine as Author, 105 IOWA L. REV. 2053 (2020) (arguing that works generated by AI 
belong to the public domain); Phuoc Nguyen, The Monkey Selfie, Artificial Intelligence 
and Authorship in Copyright: The Limits of Human Rights, 6 PUB. INT. L.J. N.Z. 121 (2019) 
(arguing for future nonhuman persons to have legal rights including authorship 
rights), or as potential inventors, see, e.g., Cos. & Intell. Prop. Comm'n, Patent Jour­
nal Including Trade Marks, Designs and Copyright in Cinematographic Films, 54 PAT. J. 1, 
255 (July 2021) (denoting DABUS as the inventor in a South African patent); Thaler 
v. Comp. Gen. of Patents Trade Marks and Designs, [2021] EWCA (Civ.) 1374 (2021) 
(denying DABUS inventorship rights); Zachary Grant, Artificial Intellectual Property, 
101 MICH. B.J. 18 (2022) (discussing how South Africa was the first country to grant an 
AI patent rights to Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience 
(DABUS) while other countries considering similar patent applications from DABUS 
rejected the possibility). For an accessible and thoughtful survey of the issues raised 
by AIs being "inventors," see Steve Lohr, Can A.I. Invent?, N.Y. TIMES (July 15, 2023), 
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/15/technology/ai-inventor-patents.html. On the 
more theoretical side, some theorists have tried to incorporate the discussion of AI

personality into larger theories of social structure and norm formation, albeit at a 
highly abstract level. See e.g., Gunther Teubner, Rights of Non-­Humans? Electronic 
Agents and Animals as New Actors in Politics and Law, 33 J.L. & SOC'Y 497 (2006). The 
article is thought-­provoking, like all of Teubner's work, but the reader is warned—­to 
paraphrase Winston Churchill—­that the density of its prose defends it well from 
the risk it might be read. The endnotes to chapter 2 contain more references. One 
important book, DAVID J. GUNKEL, PERSON, THING, ROBOT: A MORAL AND LEGAL ONTOLOGY FOR 
THE 21ST CENTURY AND BEYOND (2023), was published after manuscript submission.

31.  The term is Giambattista Vico's, taken from his 1725 work THE NEW SCIENCE. Vico 
claimed that human history has to be understood partly in terms of the metaphors, 
analogies, and poetic imagery with which we pre-­process and thus understand real­
ity, an act that relies conspicuously on the process of empathy, of personification, 
that I discuss in this chapter. "Rational metaphysics teaches that man becomes 
all things by understanding them . . . , imaginative metaphysics shows that man 
becomes all things by not understanding them . . . ; and perhaps the latter proposi­
tion is truer than the former, for when man understands he extends his mind and 
takes in the things, but when he does not understand he makes the things out of 
himself and becomes them by transforming himself into them." GIAMBATTISTA VICO, 
THE NEW SCIENCE para. 405 Thomas Bergin and Max Fisch tr. (2016) (emphasis added).
32.  Actually, pencils do turn out to be a fascinating, and revealing, subject. The late 
Henry Petrovski, one of my brilliant colleagues at Duke, literally wrote the book on 
them, though he never claimed that level of existential importance for their exis­
tence. HENRY PETROVSKI, THE PENCIL (1990).
33.  Among other things, as I will argue later, this means that the Turing Test's intui­
tive plausibility is now gone—­dead at the hands of a chatbot. Some people have 
noticed the Turing Test's passing. See Conversations with Tyler, Reid Hoffman on the 
Possibilities of AI (June 28, 2023), https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/reid
-hoffman-2 ("For example, five, ten years ago, we were beating the drum on the 
Turing Test, and now we've sailed past the Turing Test, and almost no one's really 
talked about it. We learn, 'Oh, actually, in fact, what was unique is not the Turing 
Test. It's these other things.'").

31.  I have always loved this quotation and have never been able to identify it 
definitively. Richard Meredith, who used portions of it as the title of two of his 
Timeliner trilogy novels, lists it as an "Arabian Proverb." I am normally skeptical of 
general attributions like "Arabian" or "African" proverb—­think of how we would 
scoff at something being called a "European proverb." However, Arabic is at least a 
language rather than a continent and since the earliest source in which I can find it 
is an 1875 book of "Arabic Proverbs," an Arabic proverb it will have to stay. See JOHN 
LEWIS BURCKHARDT, ARABIC PROVERBS; OR THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE MODERN EGYPTIANS 
132 (1875).

2.  Butler was a believer in evolution, though he felt Charles Darwin claimed too 
much credit for the development of the theory and ignored the contributions of 
others, particular Darwin's own grandfather, Erasmus Darwin. This led to a notable 
literary feud, beautifully chronicled in GEORGE DYSON, DARWIN AMONG THE MACHINES: THE 
EVOLUTION OF GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE (1996). Butler also was genuinely interested in the 
difficulty of drawing a line between consciousness and the life of machines—­so the 
passage is far from being purely tongue-­in-­cheek. My own guess is that he enjoyed 
the ambiguity of his satire and did not mind that some would view it as sincere 
and others as a critique of evolution. However, once critics started to do the latter, 
Butler wrote to Darwin specifically disclaiming any attempt to ridicule The Origin of 
Species in "The Book of the Machines." Letter from Samuel Butler to Charles Darwin,

entities such as Hal that exhibit all of the capabilities of human thought, "machines 
that can do any work a man can do," in Simon's words, and sometimes to those that 
seem to possess consciousness. When I use the capitalized phrases "AI" or "Artificial 
Intelligence" I am referring to the latter two more impressive connotations. Other 
terms for the same concept are "Human-­Level Artificial Intelligence," "Artificial 
General Intelligence," "General AI," or "General-­Purpose AI." I occasionally use those 
when clarity, or brevity, seems to require it. It should be born in mind, though, that 
one could have a machine of the kind Simon describes—­able to write a symphony, 
cook an omelet, fly a plane, and teach calculus—­that was not in any sense conscious.

16.  Although the reach of deep learning algorithms was greater than initially 
expected, some argued that there were domains where those techniques had not 
(yet) proved their worth. This 2017 article, for example, argues that:
What we're seeing here is that deep learning algorithms can provide improvements in narrow 
A.I. across many types of problem domains. Deep learning provides discontinuous jumps relative 
to previous machine learning or A.I. performance trendlines in image recognition and speech 
recognition; it doesn't in strategy games or natural language processing, and machine transla­
tion and arcade games are ambiguous (machine translation because metrics differ; arcade games 
because there is no pre-­deep-­learning comparison.)

press.com/2017/01/28/performance-trends-in-ai (last visited Dec. 27, 2022). The 
AlphaGo Zero program discussed later, however, uses another form of deep learn­
ing—deep reinforcement learning—­to excel at Go, paradigmatically thought of as a 
strategy game, and both translation and natural language processing have recently 
advanced by leaps and bounds, so this statement may no longer be true.

we, along with most informed participants in these debates, are skeptical about our 
ability to forecast rates of economic and productivity growth many years into the

humor aimed quite brilliantly at anticipating emotional objections and disarming 
the reader of the article. That same intuitive understanding of likely skepticism, and 
the ability humorously to refute it, would presumably work not just on a reader but 
on a Turing tester, at least one with a British sense of irony.

Turing might have been surprised to find out that B. F. Skinner and the behaviorists 
were willing to embrace the position that humans are automata and that conscious­
ness is an illusion and turn it into an intellectual franchise. Here is J. B. Watson, one 
of the founding behaviorists, writing about consciousness and the mind:
If the behaviorists are right in their contention that there is no observable mind-­body problem 
and no observable separate entity called mind—­then there can be no such thing as conscious­
ness and its subdivision. Freud's concept borrowed from somatic pathology breaks down. There 
can be no festering spot in the substratum of the mind—­in the unconscious—­because there is 
no mind.

Scientific attempts to understand human thinking have historically drawn on analogies with 
contemporary technologies, from clockworks to telephone switchboards to digital computers. 
Today, one of the most exciting emerging technologies is quantum computation, which attempts 
to overcome limitations of classical computers by employing phenomena unique to quantum-­
level events, such as nonlocal entanglement and superposition. It is therefore not surprising that 
many researchers have conjectured that quantum effects in the brain are crucial for explaining 
psychological phenomena, including consciousness. We argue, however, that explaining brain 
function by appeal to quantum mechanics is akin to explaining bird flight by appeal to atomic 
bonding characteristics. . . . We conclude that understanding brain function is unlikely to require 
quantum computation or similar mechanisms. Id. at 593-­94.

won first place in the emerging digital artists' contest at the Colorado State Fair's 
annual art competition). Not everyone has joined the chorus of lamentation. Farhad 
Manjoo argues persuasively that AI may actually benefit both art and artists. "What 
accounts for my sunny stance? History offers one clue: Technologies that made 
art easier to produce have rarely ended up stifling human creativity. Electronic 
synthesizers didn't eliminate the need for people who play musical instruments. 
Auto-­Tune didn't make singing on pitch obsolete. Photography didn't kill painting, 
and its digitization didn't obviate the need for professional photographers." Farhad

a similar argument about the effect of AI on computer programming—­abstracting 
from the precise form of the activity as it is currently constituted to the role that 
humans play. Coding may cease to be an activity humans engage in, but humans 
will still have a role in working to instruct computers on how to perform complex 
tasks, even if it is increasingly done through natural language. Farhad Manjoo, It's

94.  This response locates the creativity in the human being who forms the prompts. 
We do not doubt Ansel Adams's artistry even though it was conveyed through a 
camera rather than a paintbrush. Why should this be any different? The difficulty is 
the scale of the relative contributions of human and machine. While some prompts 
exhaustively detail style, composition, shadow, exposure, and even type of camera 
lens, others consist of only two or three words. The US Copyright Office attempts to 
navigate just this line: "In the Office's view, it is well-­established that copyright can 
protect only material that is the product of human creativity. Most fundamentally,

the term 'author,' which is used in both the Constitution and the Copyright Act, 
excludes non-­humans." 37 C.F.R. § 202 (2023). Thus, the Copyright Office will 
register copyrights over AI-­generated material only if the human being contributes 
significant artistic input. For example, a comic book that contained human text 
and AI-­generated images was copyrightable as a whole, but the individual machine-­
generated images in the comic were not. See id. A similar approach has been taken 
in patent law, with courts declaring that only a human can be an inventor. Thaler v. 
Vidal 43 F.4th 1207 (Fed. Cir. 2022).

96.  Baumol's cost disease or cost effect is a description of a counterintuitive eco­
nomic phenomenon. Some occupations or economic fields experience very little 
productivity growth over time, yet potentially share in the higher wages that more 
productive occupations receive. You still need four musicians and 90 minutes for 
your eighteenth-­century string quartet, just as you did when it was written. Mean­
while average labor productivity has dramatically increased. WIKIPEDIA, s.v. Baumol 
Effect, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol_effect (last visited July 12, 2023).
97.  Academic scholarship on the issue is split between will theorists, who believe 
the predicate for rights is the ability freely to make rational moral choices, and inter­
est theorists, who believe that rights should be given to all of those with the relevant 
moral interests, even if, like a baby or a person deemed legally insane, they have no 
such ability. I identify more with the interest theory side of the debate, but my point 
here is only that the criteria we apply to AI will reflect our underlying moral presup­
positions and that any test for personhood will probably include strands reflecting 
both lines of thought. Our folkways are less methodologically monocultural than 
our academic theories and, from my point of view, that is not always a bad thing.

Someone paints a picture in order to shew how he imagines a theatre scene. And now I say: "This 
picture has a double function: it informs others, as pictures or words inform-­but for the one who 
gives the information it is a representation (or piece of information?) of another kind: for him it 
is the picture of his image, as it can't be for anyone else. To him his private impression of the pic­
ture means what he has imagined, in a sense in which the picture cannot mean this to others."—­
And what right have I to speak in this second case of a representation or piece of information—­if 
these words were rightly used in the first case?
See also LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN, LAST WRITINGS ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF PSYCHOLOGY: THE INNER 
AND THE OUTER §84 (G.H. von Wright et al. eds., vol. 2, 1992) ("[t]he 'inner' is a delu­
sion. That is: the whole complex of ideas alluded to by this word is like a painted 
curtain drawn in front of the scene of the actual word use"). Some of Wittgenstein's 
discussion seems to me to imply that there is indeed a rich inner life, but that it is 
one to which language and behavior—­the "painted curtain"—­can give others only 
limited and uncertain access. "There's no art to find the mind's construction in the 
face." WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, MACBETH Act 4, sc. 1. I have no clear view of your inner 
theater, merely of the reduced and possibly falsified, distorted, or misunderstood 
version of it presented by the "painted curtain" used in traditional stage produc­
tions, dramatizing certain aspects of the play. In that sense, Wittgenstein is fulfill­
ing his characteristic role: showing us how misplaced terminology and reliance on 
reified definitions can cause us to understand something poorly, if at all. For an 
excellent discussion of these points, see Paul Standish, Inner and Outer, Psychology and 
Wittgenstein's Painted Curtain, 56 J. PHIL. EDUC. 115 (2022). I would happily acknowl­
edge, however, that one reason Wittgenstein is of such enduring interest is that his 
words can be used as "intuition pumps" for a wide range of ideas, not all of them 
consistent.

110.  My colleagues Brandon Garrett and Cynthia Rudin argue that we have accepted 
all too easily the trade-­off between transparency and accuracy, one they believe to 
be illusory. They claim that in many cases far simpler, human legible criteria can 
produce results that are equally accurate. Garrett & Rudin, supra note 108. Of course, 
the legal system in particular should require algorithms that are open and trans­
parent rather than closed and proprietary and Garret and Rudin's specific criminal 
justice arguments are extremely persuasive. I remain unconvinced, however, of the 
larger claim that the trade-­off will always be as illusory as they suggest. Many of the 
stories of machine learning's greatest successes, such as that of breast cancer detec­
tion, reinforce this conclusion.

28.  Id. at 802 (Burger, J., concurring). Justice Scalia's concurrence in Citizens United 
made a similar point, using a version of association theory to argue that the freedom

grateful to Larry Lessig for stressing the importance of this point.
29.  There are a number of wonderful historical accounts of the history of the strug­
gle for constitutional personhood for corporations, including the roles of Conkling 
and of the Supreme Court's reporter. The story begins with the work of Charles and 
Mary Beard, often presented—­perhaps unfairly—­as the proponents of the "conspir­
acy theory" of the Fourteenth Amendment. The most definitive historical account 
of Conkling's argument and of the actual framing of the Amendment is HOWARD J. 
GRAHAM, EVERYMAN'S CONSTITUTION: HISTORICAL ESSAYS ON THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT, THE 
"CONSPIRACY THEORY," AND AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM (1968). C. PETER MAGRATH, MOR­
RISON R. WAITE: THE TRIUMPH OF CHARACTER (1963) should be credited as pointing me 
toward invaluable primary sources and providing important context. THOM HART­
MANN, "UNEQUAL PROTECTION": HOW CORPORATIONS BECAME "PEOPLE"—­AND HOW YOU CAN FIGHT 
BACK (2010) offers a passionate negative case against corporate constitutional rights, 
studded with a surprising amount of historical detail and facsimiles of the original 
documents. Last, but by no means least, I am indebted to Adam Winkler's extremely 
readable WE, THE CORPORATIONS: HOW AMERICAN BUSINESSES WON THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS (2018).

3.  I profited greatly from Kate Darling's excellent recent book, The New Breed, which 
explicitly makes this analogy. KATE DARLING, THE NEW BREED: WHAT OUR HISTORY WITH ANI­
MALS REVEALS ABOUT OUR FUTURE WITH ROBOTS (2021).
4.  Many philosophers have used consciousness to distinguish humans from other 
creatures. See, e.g., Immanuel Kant, Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, in 
CAMBRIDGE EDITION OF THE WORKS OF IMMANUEL KANT 227, 239 (Robert Louden ed., Gunter 
Zoller trans., 2010) (1798) (arguing that humans' ability to have the representa­
tion of "I" raises them above other beings); Daniel Dennet, Animal Consciousness: 
What Matters and Why, 62 SOC. RSCH. 691, 702-­03 (1995) (arguing that human con­
sciousness is a kind of "user-­illusion" that entails an "informational organization" 
not present in other species, although he pleads mischaracterization when being 
described as arguing that "other species lack our kind of self-­consciousness"). How­
ever, other philosophers focus on developing criteria for determining personhood 
rather than on distinguishing humans from other beings. See, e.g., David DeGra­
zia, Human-­Animal Chimeras: Human Dignity, Moral Status, and Species Prejudice, 38 
METAPHILOSOPHY 309, 319-­20 (2007) (arguing that personhood is not coextensive with 
humanity but that the being needs a "sufficiently complex" form of consciousness 
that has a "high enough" degree of autonomy, rationality, self-­awareness, linguistic 
competence, sociability, moral agency, and intentionality in action). Other phi­
losophers reject personhood as the primary moral criteria. See, e.g., JEREMY BENTHAM, 
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE PRINCIPLES OF MORALS AND LEGISLATION, ch. xvii, at 351 (1789), 
http://www.koeblergerhard.de/Fontes/BenthamJeremyMoralsandLegislation1789
.pdf (making an early and forceful argument for a sentience-­oriented view of moral­
ity and identifying the capacity to suffer as the relevant criteria).
5.  True, we might think that fairness requires that we should treat all property 
owners in the same way. Therefore if we allow corporations to hold title to property 
in the same way that natural persons do, they should be given the same due process 
protections. But this is a secondary consequence of a classification we know at all 
times is merely a convenient fiction, and it is one that we could forgo or modify 
without violating a central tenet of the moral duties we believe to be owed to natu­
ral persons.
6.  The hard-­core utilitarian might argue that all moral claims reduce to some kind 
of utilitarian, consequentialist analysis and thus that the categorical nature of the 
distinction I am making is illusory. In the abstract, that is a fair point. Concretely, 
I could debate the philosophy at length, but I think the crispest response here is 
"bullshit." If you honestly tell me that, beyond the level of formal deontological 
classification, your framework for assessing the moral rights and duties of your child 
is the same as that for assessing the rights and duties of IBM, there is little I can do

had furnished with etchings of nudes." Pascal Treguer, History of Come Up and See My 
Etchings, WORD HISTS., https://wordhistories.net/2020/01/11/come-see-my-etchings (last 
visited July 18, 2023). Psychologists still use it as a classic example of indirect or 
strategic speech:
Speakers often do not state requests directly but employ innuendos such as "Would you like to 
see my etchings?" Though such indirectness seems puzzlingly inefficient, it can be explained by 
a theory of the strategic speaker, who seeks plausible deniability when he or she is uncertain of 
whether the hearer is cooperative or antagonistic.

Courts are the Competent Institutions. This issue is uniquely suitable for the courts to deal with. 
Courts are the bodies that society has set up to deal with complex factual issues, to be respon­
sive to changing circumstances, and yet to be objective. An issue like this, which needs all of 
these qualities for its resolution, must be left to the courts. In addition, this issue needs to be 
resolved by an institution, which can take outside expert advice and has a firm understanding 
of the changing moral consensus of our society. Courts are the only bodies which combine all 
of these abilities.
Courts are not the Competent Institution. This issue cannot be decided by the courts. Dealing 
as it does with issues of change. It must be left to the legislature, a body which reflects changing 
public opinion, which can bring in outside experts, and which is used to dealing with com­
plex factual issues such as this. Regulation is the job of the legislature and the administrative 
branch; the courts should apply and not make the law; if they do otherwise they threaten the 
separation of powers. This issue, thus, cannot be seen outside the context of our entire institu­
tional structure—­a structure which should not be threatened for the sake of some "quick fix" 
judicial solution.

scientific and ethical benefits of the research and whether those can be achieved 
in other ways, the various reasons that people might object to the use of human 
tissues or cells, the types of reactions such research might engender in regulators, 
and so on. Bioethicists do a lot of that kind of work, carefully working out in the 
specific details of some research protocol and procedure the various ethical interests 
involved and administrative safeguards, or flat prohibitions, needed. They deserve 
our gratitude for it. Here, I am going to be focused on the more speculative, philo­
sophical side of ethical work, but I do not want that to give a misleading impression 
of the field as a whole.

intraspecies chimeras, an entity receives cells of a different genotype from another 
member of the same species. This can happen in bone marrow transplants or when 
one fetus also has cells derived from a sibling in the womb. I will be talking here 
only about interspecies chimeras, and specifically about human-­nonhuman animal 
chimeras.

Scientists have successfully grown monkey embryos containing human cells for the first time—­
the latest milestone in a rapidly advancing field that has drawn ethical questions. In the work, 
published on 15 April in Cell, the team injected monkey embryos with human stem cells and 
watched them develop. They observed human and monkey cells divide and grow together in a 
dish, with at least 3 embryos surviving to 19 days after fertilization. . . . Researchers hope that 
some human-­animal . . . chimaeras—­could provide better models in which to test drugs, and be 
used to grow human organs for transplants. Members of this research team were the first to show 
in 2019 that they could grow monkey embryos in a dish for up to 20 days after fertilization. In 
2017, they reported a series of other hybrids: pig embryos grown with human cells, cow embryos 
grown with human cells, and rat embryos grown with mouse cells.

26.  See Jeff McMahan, Cognitive Disability, Misfortune, and Justice, 25 PHIL. & PUB. AFFS. 
3, 30 (1996). Perhaps to his credit, McMahan is willing to say so clearly and specifi­
cally rather than to obfuscate.
To my mind, the most plausible general view is that there are certain properties and capacities 
that give their possessor an inherent worth that demands respect. It is the possession of these 
properties and capacities that makes an individual one's moral equal and thus brings him or her 
within the sphere of justice. There are different accounts of what the relevant properties and 
capacities are, though there is general agreement that they are psychological rather than physical 
in nature . . . if the properties are intrinsic rather than relational, and in particular if they are 
psychological rather than physical, and if animals (or at least animals other than the great apes) 
are excluded from the sphere of justice because they do not possess these properties, then it seems 
to follow that human beings with comparable psychological properties and capacities must be excluded 
as well [emphasis added].
I recommend the response of Eva Feder Kittay, a philosopher and ethicist who 
is herself the mother of a daughter with mental disabilities. Eva Feder Kittay, At the 
Margins of Moral Personhood, 116 ETHICS 100 (2005). The emotion and compassion 
with which she sees the issue brilliantly animates but does not overwhelm the care­
ful ethical argument, rather than simply prompting an outpouring of outrage.

31.  This possibility has been the basis for much fascinating science fiction. See, e.g.,

around Brin's uplift novels are given new salience by AI.
COWEN: What in science fiction do you feel has risen the most in status for you?
HOFFMAN: Oh, for me.
COWEN: Not in the world. We don't know yet.
HOFFMAN: Yes. We don't know yet.
COWEN: You think, "Oh, this was really important." Vernor Vinge or . . .
HOFFMAN: Well, this is going to seem maybe like a strange answer to you, but I've 
been rereading David Brin's Uplift series very carefully because the theory of, "How 
should we create other kinds of intelligences, and what should that theory be, and 
what should be our shepherding and governance function and symbiosis?" is a 
question that we have to think about over time. He went straight at this in a biologi­
cal sense, but it's the same thing, just a different substrate with the Uplift series. I've 
recently reread the entire Uplift series.

33.  It should be noted that variants of this argument can be used to attack as 
well as to apologize for the existing social order. The Levellers' subversive ditty 
"When Adam delv'd and Eve span / Who then was the gentleman?" is both a good 
example of such an attack and my favorite piece of rhyming natural law. If there 
was no social hierarchy in the Garden of Eden, the divine state of nature, it fol­
lows that social stratification is something human created, after the Fall. It thus 
must be a result of the entry of evil into the world. The nobility are the work of 
the devil!

23.  U.S. CONST. amend. XIV § 1.
24.  Advocates, including the natural law scholar John Finnis, have used an argu­
ment similar to the ones Tommy's lawyers employed: that by various criminal, tort, 
and other remedies, the substantive law of the states already recognized fetuses as 
legal persons when the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted. Brief for Scholars of 
Jurisprudence John M. Finnis & Robert P. George as Amici Curiae Supporting Peti­
tioners, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org., 142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022) (No. 19-­
1392); see also Gregory J. Roden, Unborn Children as Constitutional Persons, 25 ISSUES 
L. MED. 185 (2010). To me, the historical record clearly indicates the opposite. Laws 
refer to or regulate many subjects without transmuting those subjects into legal per­
sons and congressional practice indicates a specific decision to exclude the unborn 
in multiple contexts, some of them directly relevant to the Fourteenth Amendment. 
See, e.g., Michael L. Rosin, Congress Has Never Considered Fetuses Persons within the 
Meaning of the 14th Amendment, SLATE (June 9, 2022), https://slate.com/news-and
-politics/2022/06/gop-abortion-constitution-fetuses-legal-persons.html.
25.  Howard J. Graham, The "Conspiracy Theory" of the Fourteenth Amendment, 47 YALE 
L.J. 371, 378 (1938) (quoting Oral Argument of Roscoe Conkling, in SAN MATEO CASE, ARGU­
MENTS AND DECISIONS 33 [Stan. Univ. Library ed.]); see also Ralph Waldo Emerson, The 
Problem, POETS.ORG, https://poets.org/poem/problem (last visited July 20, 2023) ("[h]e 
builded better than he knew").
26.  See Natasha N. Aljalian, Note, Fourteenth Amendment Personhood: Fact or Fiction?, 
73 ST. JOHN'S L. REV. 495 (1999) (arguing that if corporations meet the constitutional 
definition of personhood then fetuses should as well); see also Michael Stokes 
Paulsen, The Plausibility of Personhood, 74 OHIO ST. L.J. 13, 23 n.34 (2013) (noting the 
argument from advocates that runs from "irony or hypocrisy" that "[i]f even corpo­
rations can be treated by the law as legal 'persons,' then surely unborn babies should 
be treated as legal persons, too").
27.  See, e.g., LEE EPSTEIN & JACK KNIGHT, THE CHOICES JUSTICES MAKE (1997) (giving a stra­
tegic account of how Justices on the Supreme Court behave to achieve their policy 
preferences); Jack Knight & Lee Epstein, The Norm of Stare Decisis, 40 AM. J. POL. SCI.

decision-­making); Thomas J. Miceli & Metin M. Coşgel, Reputation and Judicial

importance).

ing for the existence of superprecedents in agreement with Chief Justice Roberts); 
see also Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org., 142 S. Ct. 2228, 2262-­78 (2022) 
(analyzing whether stare decisis protects Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey 
from being overruled); Confirmation Hearing on the Nomination of Hon. Brett M. Kava­

S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 115th Cong. 127 (2018) (statement of Brett Kavanaugh, 
Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia) (testifying that 
Roe v. Wade was settled precedent).
29.  See Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2373-­75 (2023) (deciding that student 
loan cancellation was a major question that Congress would have reserved for itself).
30.  Mark A. Lemley, The Imperial Supreme Court, 136 HARV. L. REV. F. 97, 97 (2022) ("the 
Court has begun to implement the policy preferences of its conservative majority in 
a new and troubling way: by simultaneously stripping power from every political

37.  As someone who has presented competing "ideal types" of arguments before, 
I know that one of the dangers in doing so is that lazy commentators will select 
one of the extreme views and present it as if it were my own position. I can hardly 
prevent that process but serve advance notice of my objection!
