PREFACE TO THE STUDENT
This study guide
has been designed especially
i^or you,
"the
student;.
It conforms with the seventh edition
o-f CALCULUS AND
ANALYTIC GEOMETRY,
by George
B.
Thomas and Ross
L.
Finney.
It
is
intended as
a seli^-study workbook to assist you
in mastering the basic
ideas
in
calculus.
Although this manual
was written to
coniform to the
Thomas/Finney CALCULUS AND ANALYTIC GEOMETRY,
it
can
be used to
accompany any standard calculus textbook and
course.
Organization And Learning Objectives
The study manual
is organized section
by section to correspond
with the Thomas/Finney text.
For each section we
speci'fy
its main
ideas by stating appropriate
learning OBJECTIVES.
Each objective
states a particular task
i^or you to
peri^orm
in order to master that
objective.
Usually the task requires you to solve
a certain type
o^f
problem related to the discussion
in the text;
sometimes the task
requires you to demonstrate
pro"ficiency with certain key terms or
concepts.
In every case the objective
is highly
specii^ic and states
exactly what you must
do.
One or more examples
i^ollows each objective and
illustrates
its
requirements.
Each example
is written
in
a semi -programmed
i^ormat;
that
is,
the example
is only partially worked
out,
so you must supply
some
oi^ the
intermediate
results yourself.
Correct answers to each
intermediate
result
are supplied
at the bottom of the
page.
Thus,
each example
is broken down
into
a sequence
of steps to guide you
through the procedures and techniques associated with
its solution.
Each example
has been carefully selected not to
repeat examples or
problems
in the Thomas/Finney text;
thus you
retain the full
array of
the text problems for practice and further
learning.
Self-tests
At the end
of each chapter there
is a SELF-TEST.
Each test
is
followed
by complete solutions to
all
the test problems.
The test
problems cover the objectives and
are similar
in scope and difficulty
to the examples
in this manual
and the examples and problems
in the
Thomas/Finney text.
The test should
be useful
in preparing for class
examinations
Ill

How To Use This Study Guide
We
recommend
that, this manual
be
used
in the -following way:
1.
Read the textbook
;
Carei^ully
read the section
oi^ Thomas/Finney
assigned you
by your calculus
instructor.
2.
Study the
learning objectives and examples:
Read each objective
and work through the associated example(s)
in the corresponding
section of this manual.
You should
conceal
the answers to the
examples
at the bottom of the
page.
Work with
pencil
and scratch
paper as you are guided through each solution,
writing
in the
intermediate
results
in the blanks provided.
3.
Check your answers
;
Ai^ter
all
the blanks for a given problem are
filled
in,
compare your answers with the correct answers
at the
bottom
of^ the
page.
If you have difficulty or do not fully
understand the answers given,
review the material
in the textbook
or consult with your
instructor.
4.
Do the chapter self -test
;
After you complete
a chapter
in Thomas/
Finney,
review the objectives for that chapter
in this manual.
Then take the chapter self-test and compare your solutions with
those provided.
Problems
in the
self -test sometimes bring
together several
ideas from the
chapter.
Guidance From Your Instructor
We caution you that the
learning objectives given
in this manual
by no means exhaust
all
the possible objectives that
could
be written
for a careful
study of calculus;
we
have tried to
identify the main
ones.
However,
your
instructor may have additional
requirements.
For
instance,
he or
she may want you to
be able to prove certain theorems
or derive
results
in the text.
We
have
not stated objectives of this
sort.
Also,
your
instructor may consider some objectives far more
important than others and
not
require that you master some objectives
at
all.
So
it
is
imperative that you find out specifically what your
instructor considers essential,
and study accordingly.
This manual
should
be helpful
to you
both
in
identifying the tasks and
successfully mastering them.
The problems assigned
by your
instructor
should help you discover those concepts and applications of calculus
that your
instructor wishes to
stress.

A second class of problems
in calculus
involves determining a
when
its
rate
of change
is known.
This branch
is
called the

FUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS.
In this section
oi^ the textbook,
there are several
terms
associated with the concept
o"f a ^function with which you will
need to
become
"feuniliar.
The "following
items are designed to assist you
in
learning the precise mathematical meanings
o"f these various terms.
31.
A variable
is a symbol
such
as
x,
y,
t,
etc.
that may take
on
any value over a prescribed
set.
The
set
o^f values that a
variable may take
on
is called the

Calculus
is concerned with
how variables are
related.
I-f to
each value
o-f the variable
x
there corresponds a unique
then
is said to
be
value
of the variable
y,
of
x.
The key word
in this dei^inition
of inunction
is
:
we do not want to
input
a single value for the
variable
x
with two or more possible outcomes for
y.
Every
function
is determined by two things:
(1)
the
of
the first variable
x
and
(2)
the
or condition
describing how
y
is obtained from
x
so that the ordered
pairs
(x,y)
belong to the function.
The variable
x
is
called the
variable
or
•
of the function;
the second variable
y
is called the
variable.
It
is also said that the function
the x-variable to
its
image y-value.
The
set of values taken on by the dependent
variable
y
is called the
of the function.

An equation
involving the variables
x
and
y
is said to
determine
y
as a function
of
x,
say
y = f(x),
provided that
f
satisfies the equation.
31
32
For
instance,
consider the equation
x
+ y
=2.
If we
substitute
y =
-^2
-
x^
into the equation we obtain
)

x2
+
(^2

so the equation
is satisfied.
Similarly,
if we substitute
y =

-
x^
into the equation
we obtain
x2
+
(_
^2
-
x2)2
=
yc'

(

and the equation
is again satisfied.
Therefore,
each
of the
two functions
y =
-J 2
- x
and
y =
-
-J 2
- x
is defined
by the equation
x^
+
y^

To calculate the derivative

differentiate both

solve for

THE CHAIN RULE.
OBJECTIVE
I
;
If
y
is a d ifferent iable function
of
x
and
x
is a
d ifferent iable function of
t,
use the
chain
rule to
calculate
dy/dt
50.
If
y
is a d ifferent iable function
of
x
and
x
is a
d ifferent iable function
of
t,
then
y
is
a d ifferent iable
function of
,
and -^
=
.
This
rule
is known
as the
rule for the derivative
of a composite function.
51.
Consider the
chain
rule
in functional
form:
let
y = g(x)
and
X = f (t)
be
d ifferent iable functions.
Then the composite
y = h(t)
= g(f (t))
is a d ifferent iable function
of
.
When
t =
to
,
let
x = f(to)
=
x©
.
According to the chain
rule the derivative
of
h
evaluated
at
t
=
t©
is given by
h
("to)
=
•
In this equation,
h (t©)
corresponds
to
(dy/dt)*^,
g (xo)
corresponds to
,
and
corresponds to
(dy/dt)*
.
It
is
important that you observe
that the derivatives
in the chain
rule equation
-^^
=
-j^
• ^^
dt
dx
dt
are being evaluated
at different
points:
dy/dt
and
dx/dt
are evaluated
at
,
whereas
dy/dx
is evaluated
at
f (to)
=
.
Failure to understand this fact
can
lea-d to
serious misuse

NEWTON'S METHOD FOR APPROXIMATING SOLUTIONS OF EQUATIONS.

I
:
Use the Newton-Raphson method to estimate the
root
of
an
equation
^(x)

within specified
a

b.
73.
In using the Newton-Raphson method,
to go from the
nth
approximation
Xp
of the
root to the
next approximation
Xp
i
^
use the formula
Xn4.i
=
•
This formula fails
if
the derivative
f (xp)
equals
.
74.
Suppose
it
is
required to find
a real
root to the equation
f(x)
=
x^
+ X
-
1.
Since
f(0)
=
and
f(l)
=
I
differ
in
sign,
an unknown
root
lies somewhere
in the
interval
< X
<
1.
As
a first guess,
choose
Xj^

0.5.
To apply the
Newton-Raphson formula,
we calculate the derivative

At 9:00 A.M.
ship B was
65
miles due east
of another ship
A.
Ship B was then sailing due west
at
10
miles per hour,
and
ship A was sailing due south
at
15
miles per hour.
If they
continue to follow their respective courses,
when will
they
be
nearest one another and how near?
Solution.
Let
and
Br
denote the
original
positions
of the ships
at 9:00

A.M.

and
let
A
and
B
denote their
new positions,
respectively,
at

later.
This
is pictured
in the figure
at

Let
s
denote the distance
between
A
and
B.
The problem
is to
minimize
and to find the time
when
its minimum occurs.
Since
rate x
time
= distance,
the distance covered
by
ship
A
in
t
hours
is
miles,
and
by ship
B
miles.
The original
distance between
A
and B
is given
as
65
miles,
so the distance between the
original
position
A©
and ship
B
after
t
hours
is
Fill this
information
into the figure and then calculate the
square
of the distance:
s^

Differentiation of
both sides
of this equation with
respect to

gives

Thus,
ds/dt =
when
30(15t)

Simplifying

that

We

Since
S =

y^

function of both the variables

we use the equation
of the ellipse to eliminate the variable

that substitution gives

A

of
a straight beach;
a store
is at point
B,

If the

5

find the point
C
on the beach to which the
lighthouse keeper should
row to get
from the
lighthouse to the store
in the
least possible time.

The
information
is sketched
in the figure
at the

From the

the distance from

The minimum time occurs when

Simplifying algebraically,
5x =

x^

or
X

However,
x =
16/3
is outside the allowable
range of values
<
x

Therefore,
the minimum must
be
taken
on
at one

of the
interval.
Checking each
point,
T(0)
=

and
T(4)
=

The
smaller of these values occurs when

conclusion
is that the

in the

The
cost per hour of driving a ship through the water varies
approximately as the
cube
of
its speed
in the water.
Suppose a
ship runs
into a current of

relative to the ocean bottom.
Find the total

Let

Then

The

so the total
cost function
is given
by
C(x)

To find the most economical
speed,
we want to minimize the
cost
C'(x)

The minimum cost occurs when
dC/dx =

Thus,

Since

we
see that
x =

QUADRATIC APPROXIMATIONS AND APPROXIMATION ERRORS:
EXTENDING THE
MEAN VALUE THEOREM.
OBJECTIVE
I
;
For a given function
y = ^ (x)
satisfying the hypotheses
of the Extended Mean Value Theorem,
find
a quadratic
approximation for
f
near
a specified value
x =
a.
62.
Let
f(x)
= tan
x.
Then
f'(x)
=
and
f"(x)
=
.
Hence,
f(7r/4)
=
,
f'(7r/4)
=
2,
and
f"(7r/4)
=
Therefore,
a quadratic approximation to
f
near
x =
7r/4
is
given by
^(x)
=
1
+
(x
-
I) +
.
63.
Consider the polynomial
f (x)
=
Sx'*
- 3x
+ x
-
7.
Take
a =
2
so we will
express
f (x)
in powers of
x
-
2
rather than
powers of
x.
We
need to calculate the first four derivatives
of
f
and evaluate them when
x =
.
Thus,
f'(x)
=
so
f'(2)
=
,
f;'(x)
=
so
f;'(2)
=
,
f^3^(x)
=
so
f^3^(2)
=
,
f^^^x)
=
so
f^^^(2)
=
.
Observe that
all
higher derivatives
f
" (x)
,
n
>
5,
are
identically
.
Therefore,
by the Extended Mean Value
Theorem,
f(x)

CHAPTER 4 INTEGRATION
INTRODUCTION.
The notion of the
inverse of
an operation
implies an "undoing"
or
reversal
of the operation.
That
is,
i"f we first perform an operation
and then perform
its
inverse,
we
return to the original
state.
In
arithmetic,
for example,
subtraction
is the
inverse operation
of
addition:
if we begin with the number
x
and add
3
we obtain
X +
3;
subtracting
3
from
x + 3
brings
us back to the original
number
x.
In the
next several
sections the
idea of "undoing"
the
differentiation process will
be studied.
This undoing process
is
commonly termed
indef in ite
integration or ant id ifferent iat ion
.
The
significance of the
indefinite
integration process will
be
revealed
by
an
important theorem and by the development further on
in this
chapter

v

d ifferent iable functions of some

so
C

Substituting this value
of
C
into the solution
of the differential
equation gives
as the solution to the
initial
value problem.
Suppose the acceleration
of a moving particle
is given by the
equation
a =
-(t,
,
and that when
t

it
is known that the
particle
has
initial
velocity
V =
Vr
and
initial
position
s

So
.
Let
us find the equation
of motion.
Since
a = dv/dt
the original
equation
can
be written
in differential
form as
dv =

Integration then gives
v =

C^
Imposing the
initial
condition
v
=
Vq
when
t

yields
Vq
=

so
Ci
=

Hence the velocity equation
becomes
v =
Now,
V = ds/dt
so the
last
equation
can
be written
in differential
form as
ds
=

t

Integration gives
s =

C,
From the
initial
condition
s =

is
readily
seen that

Therefore,
an equation

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS OF INTEGRAL CALCULUS.
39.
The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus concerns the
integral
F(x)
=
1^ f(t)dt
,
where
f
is continuous
on
[a
, b]
.
This theorem says that
F
is
at every point
x
in
[a
, b]
and
F'(x)
=
.
40
The notation
g(x)]
1
means
41.
The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives a rule for
calculating the definite
integral
'f(x)
<^x
o^
^ continuous
function.
The
rule states that you must first find an
F
of
f
.
That
is,
the relationship between
F
and
f
is
.
Next,
calculate the number
F(b)
-
.
This computation gives

i^or the continuous
inunction
over the

Then

this motivated the
idea of the

Ax
was revealed to
be that

a-s
Ax
,
provided that the function
f
is assumed
on

Thus,
a sum of the form
Sa
for suitably small
Ax
could
be
used
as
an approximation to the value
of the definite
integral

Two numerical methods providing such
an
approximation studied
in the previous chapter were the

THE NET CHANGE

OBJECTIVE~A
Given
a continuous function
v =
f (t)
representing the
velocity

of
a moving body as
a function
of time
t,
find the time
intervals
in which the velocity
is
positive
and
in which
it
is negative,
and calculate the
total
distance traveled
by the body during the
specified time
interval

to
t

Consider the velocity given
by
v =

for

we observe that the velocity
is

and horizontal

.
Thus,
the velocity
v
is
negative for

it
is positive for

Therefore,

find the total

Suppose the brakes are applied to
a car traveling
50 mph
and
the brakes give the
car a constant negative acceleration
of

How far will
the
car travel
before stopping?
Solut ion

To make the units consistent
in the problem,
we
convert miles per hour to feet per second.
Since
15 mph
is
equivalent to
22 ft/sec,
it follows that
50 mph
is
equivalent to
ft/sec.
The problem gives

so does the

Solving for the other

INVERSE FUNCTIONS.
I OBJECTIVE
I
:
Use the derivative
rule for
inverse functions
(Rule
11)
to calculate the derivative
of the
inverse for a
specified function.
1.
If
f
and
g
are
inverse functions
on suitably restricted
domains,
then
g(f(x))
=
and
f (g(y))
=
•
That
is,
the composite
of
g
and
f
or of
f
and
g
is the
mapping.
2.
Given
a function
y = f(x),
to find
a formula for the
inverse
function
g,
interchange the
letters
and
in the
original
equation and solve for
.
3.
If
f
and
g
are
inverse functions on suitably restricted
domains,
then
g (a)
=
1/f (b)
where
a
and
b
are
related
by
and
.
4.
Let
f (x)
= -6x +
2
and
let
g
denote the
inverse of
f
.
We
wish to calculate the derivative
g (14)
.
First,
-6x

2 =

implies
x =

Thus,
f (-2)
=

so
b =

a =

Then,
f (x)

To calculate the
inverse
of
y =

interchange the

obtaining
.
Solving the
resultant
equation for
y
yields
,
or
g(x)
=
is the
inverse function
of
f (x)
= -6x +
2.
Calculating the
derivative
g (14)
directly from the formula for
g(x)
gives
-1/6
as before.
Remark
.
The advantage
of the derivative formula for the
inverse function given
by Rule
11
of the text
is that
it
provides for the calculation
of the derivative
g (a)
even
though a formula for the
inverse function
g
is not known.

Find

rational
functions by the
method
of partial

28.
The success of separating a rational function
f (x)/g(x)
into
a sum of partial
fractions hinges upon two things:
(1)
The degree
of
f (x)
must
be
.
If this
is not the
case,
one must first perform
,
then work with the
term.
(2)
The factors of
must
be
known.
In practice
it may
be difficult to perform the factorization.

OBJECTIVE
I
:
Use the distance

an equation
"for a set
o-f points
P(x,y)
that satisfy some
speci'fied condition.
3.
Find
an equation
i^or the points
P(x,y)
whose distances
-from
F2(0,-9)
and
F2(0,9)
have the constant sum
30.
Solut ion
.
The distance
"from
P
to
Fj^
is
,
and
"from
P
to
F2
is
.
Thus,
the
speci'fied
conditions yield the equation
Jx^

(y

= 30.
Transposing the second term on the
le"ft,
to the
right
side,
and
squaring both sides gives
x^ +
(y

= 900

or,
simpli"fying algebraically,
Jx2

(y +

.
Squaring both
sides of this
last equation we find,
x2

CHAPTER 9 HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS
INTRODUCTION.
In
"this chapter you will
study the hyperbolic functions and see
that the
identities and
d ifi^erent iat ion i^ormulas associated with them
bear a striking resemblance to those associated with the trigonometric
inunctions.
Also,
there
is a direct connection between the
inverse
hyperbolic
inunctions and the natural
logarithm.
These inunctions are
useful
in applied mathematics,
in certain
integration methods,
and
in
solving differential
equations.
They arise
in the study of falling
bodies,
hanging cables,
ocean waves,
and other phenomena
in science
and engineering.

Using a "table

the approximate value of

is

The

in Problem 26
is the point

The highest point occurs when

The equation

into
(r-4)(

Thus,

The graph

circles,
one
of

Consider

Then,

Now,

Hence,

Since
r^ =

this
last equation simplifies to
y

or
y^

Therefore,

This

For

Hence,

Since

An ancient Greek paradox,
due
"to

mathemal: ic ian Zeno
,
concerned
"the
i^ol lowing problem.
Suppose
'tha't
a man
wan"ts
"to walk a
cer"tain
dis'tance,
say
"two miles,
along a
s"traigh"t
line
f^rom
A
"to
B.
Firs"t
he
mus"t
pass
"the
hal"f-way
poin't,
"then
"the
3/4
poin"t,
"then
"the
7/8
poin"t,
and
so
on
as
i 1 1 us'tra'ted
in
"the
i^ol lowing figure.

The

Therefore,

"the man

The paradox

OBJECTIVE
B|
;
Given
a sequence
{an}
determine
if
it converges or
diverges

The sequence
{a-n}
converges to the number
L

there corresponds
an
N
such that
If
no such
limit
L
exists,
we say that
an
7.
If
<
b
<
1,
then
{b"}
converges to
0.
To
see why,
consider the
inequality
|b"
-
01
=
b"
<
€.
Thus,
we seek an
integer
N
such that
for all
n
>
N.
Since the natural
logarithm
y =
In x
is
an
increasing
function for all
x,
b"
<
c
is equivalent to
n
In
b
<
In
f.
Also,
because
In
b
is a negative number for
<
b
<
1,
this
latter
inequality
is equivalent to
n
>
.
Therefore,
we
need only choose
an
integer
N
satisfying
and the criterion set forth
in Problem
6 for convergence to

One way
is
to
replace

and
show that the
resultant function

which

is
an
increasing
function
of

for every

If we take the
logarithm of both

and differentiate
implicitly with
respect to
x,
we obtain

Simplifying algebraically,

Thus,
since

we find that

[OBJECTIVE
I
;
Find the Taylor Series
at
x =
a,
or the Maclaurin
series,
i^or a given function
y = f (x)
.
Assume that
X = a
is specified and that
f
has finite derivatives
I
of
all
orders at
x =
a.
2.
If
y
=
^^(x)
has finite derivatives of
all
orders
at
x =
a,
the particular power series
f(a)

is called the

If
a =
0,
the
series
is known
as the
for
f
.
The Taylor
series for
a function may or may not converge to the function.
This problem
is
investigated
in the next article.
3.
If
y = f (x)
has finite derivatives of order up to and
including
n,
then the polynomial
Pn(x)
= f(a)
+ f'(a)(x
-
a)
+ ^-^(x
-
a) ^
+
...
+ ^-^(x-a)"
is called the nth-degree
.
The
graph
of this polynomial
passes through the point
,
and
its first
n
derivatives match the first
n
derivatives
of
at
.
Each nonnegative
integer
n
corresponds
to a Taylor polynomial
for
f
at
x =
a,
provided the first
n
derivatives of
f
exist
at
x =
a.

P3 (x)
and
P4 (x)
for the
function
f(x)

Suppose we want to express the polynomial

We

we find that

TAYLOR'S THEOREM WITH REMAINDER:

The statement
of Taylor's Theorem
in the text gives the
remainder term as
Rn(x)
=

where the number
c
lies between
.
This
remainder term measures the error
in the approximation
of
y = f (x)
by the nth-degree Taylor polynomial
at
.
Thus,
the Taylor series expansion for
f(x)
will
converge to
f (x)
provided that

This remainder form
is very useful
because often we
can bound
the derivative

by some constant
M:

The number

the computer cannot show any digits beyond

Thus the computer effectively sets
