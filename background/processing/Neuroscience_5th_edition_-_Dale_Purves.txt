PREFACE 
Whether judged in molecular, cellular, systemic, behavioral, or cognitive terms, the 
human nervous system is a stupendous piece of biological machinery. Given its 
accomplishments—all the artifacts of human culture, for instance—there is good 
reason for wanting to understand how the brain and the rest of the nervous system 
work. The debilitating and costly effects of neurological and psychiatric disease add 
a further sense of urgency to this quest. The aim of this book is to highlight the in- 
tellectual challenges and excitement—as well as the uncertainties—of what many 
see as the last great frontier of biological science. The information presented here is 
intended to serve as a starting point for undergraduates, medical students, graduate 
students in the neurosciences, and any others who want insight into how the hu- 
man nervous system operates. 
Like any other great challenge, neuroscience should be, and is, full of debate, 
dissension, and considerable fun. All these ingredients have gone into the construc- 
tion of this book's Fifth Edition; we hope they will be conveyed in equal measure to 
readers at all levels.

STUDYING THE 
Nervous SYSTEM 
Overview 
NEUROSCIENCE ENCOMPASSES A BROAD RANGE of questions about how the 
nervous systems of humans and other animals are organized, how they develop, and 
how they function to generate behavior. These questions can be explored using the 
tools of genetics and genomics, molecular and cell biology, anatomy and systems 
physiology, behavioral observation, and psychology. The major challenge facing stu- 
dents of neuroscience is to integrate the diverse knowledge derived from these vari- 
ous levels of analysis into a coherent understanding of brain structure and function. 
Many of the issues that have been explored successfully concern how the principal 
cells of all animal nervous systems—neurons and glia—perform their functions in 
anatomical, electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular terms. Diverse subsets of 
neurons constitute ensembles called neural circuits, which are the primary compo- 
nents of neural systems that process specific types of information. Neural systems 
in turn serve one of three general functions. Sensory systems represent information 
about the state of the organism and its environment; motor systems organize and 
generate actions; and associational systems link the sensory and motor components 
of the nervous system, providing the basis for "higher order" brain functions such as 
perception, attention, cognition, emotions, language, and rational thinking. These 
remarkable abilities lie at the core of understanding human beings, their behavior, 
their history, and perhaps their future. 
Genetics, Genomics, and the Brain 
The brain, like all other organs, is the product of gene expression begun during 
embryogenesis and maintained throughout life. A gene comprises both coding DNA 
sequences (exons) that are the template for messenger RNA (mRNA) that will ul- 
timately be translated into protein, and regulatory DNA sequences (promoters and 
introns) that control whether and in what quantities that gene is expressed (i.e., 
transcribed into mRNA and then translated into a functional protein) in a given cell 
type. Genetic analysis is thus fundamental to understanding the structure, function, 
and development of organs and organ systems, including the brain and nervous 
system. The advent of genomics, which focuses on the analysis of complete DNA 

CHAPTER 1 
_ Much of modern neuroscience focuses 
_ on understanding the organization and 
_ function of the human nervous system, 
__as well as the pathological bases of 
_ neurological and psychiatric diseases. 
_ These issues, however, are often dif- 
_ ficult to address by studying the human 
_ brain; therefore, neuroscientists have 
_ relied on the nervous systems of other 
animals to guide their studies. Over the 
_ last two centuries, critical information 
about the detailed anatomy, biochemis- 
_ try, physiology, cell biology and genet- 
_ ics of neural systems has been gleaned 
by studying the brains of a wide variety 
_ of species. 
Often the choice of model species 
studied reflects assumptions about 
_ enhanced functional capacity in that 
_ species; for example, from the 1950s 
_ through the 1970s, cats were the sub- 
_ jects of pioneering studies on visual 
_ function because they are highly "visu- 
al" animals, and therefore could be 
expected to have well-developed brain 
_ regions devoted to vision—regions sim- 
ilar to those found in primates, includ- 
ing humans. Much of what is currently 
known about human vision is based on 
studies carried out in cats. Studies on 
invertebrates such as the squid and the 
sea slug Aplysia californica yielded simi- 
larly critical insights into the basic cell 
biology of neurons, synaptic transmis- 
sion, and synaptic plasticity (the basis of 
learning and memory). Both the squid 
- and the sea slug were chosen because 
of certain exceptionally large nerve cells 
with stereotypic identity and connec- 
tions that were ideally suited to physi- 
ological measurements. In each case, 
the advantages offered by these excep- 
tional cells made it possible to perform 
experiments that helped answer key 
questions about neuroscience. 
Biochemical, cellular, anatomical, 
physiological, and behavioral stud- 
ies continue to be conducted on a 
wide range of animals. However, the 
complete sequencing of the genomes 
of invertebrate, vertebrate, and mam- 
malian species has led to the informal 
adoption by many neuroscientists of 
four "model" organisms based on 
BOX 1A Model Organisms in Neuroscience 
the ability to do genetic analysis and 
- manipulation in each of these species. 
A majority of the genes in the human 
" genome are expressed in the develop- 
ing and adult brain. The same is true 
in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis 
elegans; the fruit fly Drosophila melano- 
gaster; the zebrafish Danio rerio; and 
the mouse Mus musculus—four species 
commonly used in modern genetics, 
and used increasingly in neuroscience. 
Despite certain limitations in each of 
these species, the availability of their 
complete genome sequences facilitates 
research on a wide range of questions 
at the molecular, cellular, anatomical, 
and physiological levels. 
One advantage of these model spe- 
cies is that the wealth of genetic and 
genomic information for each permits 
sophisticated manipulation of gene 
expression and function. Thus, once a 
critical gene for brain development or 
function is identified, it can be specifi- 
cally manipulated in the worm, fly, fish, 
or mouse. In the worm, fly and fish, 
large-scale screens of mutant animals 
whose genomes have been modified 
randomly by chemical mutagens allow 
investigators to search for changes 
from normal development structure 
and function (the "phenotype") and to 
identify genes that are important for 
specific aspects of brain architecture or 
behavior. Similar efforts, although more 
limited in scope, have identified spon- 
taneous or induced mutations in the 
mouse that disrupt brain development 
or function. In addition, manipulations 
which result in so-called transgenic 
animals permit genes to be introduced 
Estimated genome sizes of humans and 
several "model" species. Note that the 
number of genes in an organism's genome 
does not correlate with cellular or organ- 
ismal complexity; the simple nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans, for example, has 
almost the same number of genes as a 
human. Much genetic activity is depen- 
dent on transcription factors that regulate 
when and to what degree a given gene is 
expressed. 
into the genome, or to be deleted or 
mutated ("knocked out") using the 
remarkable capacity of genomes to 
splice in new sequences that are similar 
to endogenous genes. This capacity, 
referred to as homologous recombination, 
allows DNA constructs that disrupt or 
alter the expression of specific genes 
to be inserted into the location of the 
normal gene in the host species. These 
approaches allow extensive assessment 
of the consequences of eliminating or 
altering gene function. 
Of course, neuroscientists study 
the nervous systems and behaviors of 
other species as well. Crustaceans such 
as the crayfish and lobster and insects 
such as the grasshopper and cockroach 
have been useful for discerning basic 
rules that govern neural circuit func- 
tion. Avians and amphibians, in the 
form of chickens and frogs, continue to 
be particularly useful for studying early 
neural development, and mammals 
such as the rat are used extensively for 
neuropharmacological and behavioral 
studies of adult brain function. Finally, 
non-human primates (the rhesus mon- 
key in particular) provide opportunities 
to study complex functions that closely 
approximate those carried out in the 
human brain. None of these species, 
however, is as amenable to genetic and 
genomic manipulations as are the four 
species described above.

brain (Figure 1.1A). Of this subset, about 8000 are expressed 
in all cells and tissues. Thus, a great deal of "brain-specific" 
genetic information resides in the introns and regulatory 
sequences that control timing, quantity, variability, and 
cellular specificity of gene expression. Despite the number 
of genes shared among the brain and other tissues, indi- 
vidual genes vary in the level and location of expression in 
specific brain regions and cells (i.e., the amount of mRNA 
expressed from region to region; Figure 1.1B). These differ- 
ences are the foundation of the diversity and complexity of 
brain functions.

human genome, the blue and purple regions represent those genes that are

tions and quantitative levels of expression of a single gene in the human brain. 
Dots indicate brain regions where mRNA for this particular gene can be found, 
while their color (blue-to-orange) indicates the relative level (lower-to-higher) 
of mRNA detected at each location. (C) The consequence of a single-gene 
mutation for brain development. A single gene, ASPM ("abnormal spindle-like 
microcephaly-associated protein") affects the function of a protein associated 
with mitotic spindles and results in microcephaly. In a patient carrying the 
ASPM mutation (left), the overall size of the brain is dramatically reduced and its 
anatomical organization is distorted compared to the brain of a normal control 
(right) of similar age and sex. (A, data from Ramskdld et al., 2009; B courtesy of 
the Allen Brain Atlas; C from Bond et al., 2002.) 

4 CHAPTER 1 
One of the dividends of sequencing the human genome 
has been the realization that one or a few genes, when al- 
tered (mutated), can explain at least some of the pathology 
of important neurological and psychiatric diseases. Using 
the tools of genetics and genomics, single-gene mutations 
have been identified that result in rare but devastating 
changes in brain development and function. For example, 
a mutation in a single gene that regulates mitosis can result 
in microcephaly, a condition in which the brain and head 
fail to grow and brain function is diminished dramatically 
(Figure 1.1C). In addition to genes that disrupt brain de- 
velopment, mutant genes have been found that can cause 
disorders such as Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheim- 
er's diseases. The use of genetics and genomics to under- 
stand diseases of the developing and adult nervous system 
permits deeper understanding of pathology and raises the

the result of following genetic instructions, and genomic 
information alone cannot explain how the brain operates in 
normal individuals, or how disease processes disrupt nor- 
mal brain functions. To understand how the brain and the 
rest of the nervous system work in health and disease, one 
must also understand the cell biology, anatomy, and physi- 
ology of the constituent cells and the circuits they form. 
The Cellular Components of the 
Nervous System 
Early in the nineteenth century, the cell was recognized as 
the fundamental unit of all living organisms. It was not un- 
til well into the twentieth century, however, that neurosci- 
entists agreed that nervous tissue, like all other organs, is 
made up of these fundamental units. The major reason was

have very short axons, while others, such as the retinal amacrine cell, have no 
axon at all. The drawings are not all at the same scale. 

that the first generation of "modern" neurobiologists in 
the nineteenth century had difficulty resolving the unitary 
nature of nerve cells with the microscopes and cell stain- 
ing techniques then available. The extraordinarily complex 
shapes and extensive branches of individual nerve cells— 
all of which are packed together and thus difficult to dis- 
tinguish from one another—further obscured their resem- 
blance to the geometrically simpler cells of other tissues 
(Figure 1.2). Some biologists of that era even concluded 
that each nerve cell was connected to its neighbors by pro- 
toplasmic links, forming a continuous nerve cell network, 
or reticulum (Latin, "net"). The Italian pathologist Camillo 
Golgi articulated and championed this "reticular theory" 
of nerve cell communication. Golgi made many important 
contributions to medical science, including identifying the 
cellular organelle eventually called the Golgi apparatus; the 
critically important cell staining technique that bears his 
name (see Figures 1.2 and 1.6); and an understanding of 
the pathophysiology of malaria. His reticular theory of the 
nervous system, however, eventually fell from favor and 
was replaced by what came to be known as the "neuron 
doctrine." The major proponents of the neuron doctrine 
were the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal 
and the British physiologist Charles Sherrington. 
The spirited debate occasioned by the contrasting views 
represented by Golgi and Cajal in the early twentieth cen- 
tury set the course of modern neuroscience. Based on light 
microscopic examination of nervous tissue stained with sil- 
ver salts according to Golgi's pioneering staining method, 
Cajal argued persuasively that nerve cells are discrete enti- 
ties, and that they communicate with one another by means 
of specialized contacts that are not sites of continuity be- 
tween cells. Sherrington, who had been working on the 
apparent transfer of electrical signals via reflex pathways, 
called these specialized contacts synapses. Despite the ulti- 
mate triumph of Cajal's view over that of Golgi, both were 
awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 
for their essential contributions to understanding the orga- 
nization of the brain, and in 1932 Sherrington was likewise 
recognized for his contributions. 
The subsequent work of Sherrington and others dem- 
onstrating the transfer of electrical signals at synaptic junc- 
tions between nerve cells provided strong support of the 
neuron doctrine, although occasional challenges to the au- 
tonomy of individual neurons remained. It was not until 
the advent of electron microscopy in the 1950s that any 
lingering doubts about the discreteness of neurons were 
resolved. The high-magnification, high-resolution images 
obtained with the electron microscope (Figure 1.3) clearly 
established that nerve cells are functionally independent 
units; such micrographs also identified the junctions Sher- 
rington had named synapses. Perhaps as belated consola- 
tion to Golgi, however, electron microscopic studies also 
STUDYING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

demonstrated specialized (albeit relatively rare) intercellu- 
lar continuities between some neurons. These continuities, 
or gap junctions, are similar to those found between cells 
in epithelia such as the lung and intestine. Gap junctions 
do indeed allow for cytoplasmic continuity and the direct 
transfer of electrical and chemical signals between cells in 
the nervous system. 
The histological studies of Cajal, Golgi, and a host of 
successors led to the consensus that the cells of the nervous 
system can be divided into two broad categories: nerve 
cells, or neurons, and supporting glial cells (also called 
neuroglia, or simply glia). Nerve cells are specialized for 
electrical signaling over long distances. Understanding this 
process represents one of the more dramatic success stories 
in modern biology and is the subject of Unit I. In contrast 
to nerve cells, glial cells support rather than generate elec- 
trical signals. They also serve additional functions in the 
developing and adult brain. Perhaps most important, glia 
are essential contributors to repair of the damaged nervous 
system, acting as stem cells in some brain regions, promot- 
ing regrowth of damaged neurons in regions where regen- 
eration can usefully occur, and preventing regeneration in 
other regions where uncontrolled regrowth might do more 
harm than good (see below and Unit IV). 
Neurons and glia share the complement of organelles 
found in all cells, including endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi 
apparatus, mitochondria, and a variety of vesicular struc- 
tures. In neurons and glia, however, these organelles are 
often more prominent in distinct regions of the cell. Mito- 
chondria, for example, tend to be concentrated at synapses 
in neurons, while protein-synthetic organelles such as the 
endoplasmic reticulum are largely excluded from axons 
and dendrites. In addition to the distribution of organelles 
and subcellular components, neurons and glia are in some 
measure different from other cells in the specialized fibril- 
lar or tubular proteins that constitute the cytoskeleton (see 
Figure 1.4). Although many of these proteins—isoforms 
of actin, tubulin, myosin, and several others—are found 
in other cells, their distinctive organization in neurons is 
critical for the stability and function of neuronal processes 
and synaptic junctions. Additional filament proteins char- 
acterize glial cells and contribute to their functions. The 
various filaments, tubules, subcellular motors, and scaf- 
folding proteins of the neuronal and glial cytoskeleton or- 
chestrate many functions, including the migration of nerve 
cells; the growth of axons and dendrites; the trafficking 
and appropriate positioning of membrane components, 
organelles, and vesicles; and the active processes of exo- 
cytosis and endocytosis underlying synaptic communica- 
tion. Understanding the ways in which these molecular 
components are used to insure the proper development 
and function of neurons and glia remains a primary focus 
of modern neurobiology.

Neurons 
Neurons are distinguished by their specialization for inter- 
cellular communication and moment-to-moment electri- 
cal signaling. These attributes are apparent in their overall 
morphology, in the organization of their membrane com- 
ponents for long-distance signaling, and in the structural 
and functional intricacies of the synaptic contacts between 
neurons (see Figure 1.3C). The most obvious morphologi- 
cal sign of neuronal specialization for communication is

the extensive branching of neurons. The two most salient 
aspects of this branching for typical nerve cells are the pres- 
ence of an axon, and the elaborate arborization of den- 
drites that arise from the neuronal cell body in the form 
of dendritic branches (or dendritic processes; see Figure 1.3E). 
Dendrites are the primary targets for synaptic input from 
the axon terminals of other neurons and are distinguished 
by their high content of ribosomes, as well as by specific 
cytoskeletal proteins. 
Some neurons lack dendrites altogether, while others 
have dendritic branches that rival the complexity of a ma- 
ture tree (see Figure 1.2). The number of inputs a particular 
neuron receives depends on the complexity of its dendritic 
arbor: nerve cells that lack dendrites are innervated by just 
one or a few other nerve cells, whereas neurons with in- 
creasingly elaborate dendritic branches are innervated by 
a commensurately larger number of other neurons. The 
number of inputs to a single neuron reflects the degree of 
convergence, while the number of targets innervated by any 
one neuron represents its divergence. 
The synaptic contacts made by axon endings on den- 
drites (and, less frequently, on neuronal cell bodies) re- 
present a special elaboration of the secretory apparatus 
found in most polarized epithelial cells. Typically, the axon 
terminal of the presynaptic neuron is immediately adja- 
cent to a specialized region of postsynaptic receptors on 
the target cell. For the majority of synapses, there is no 
physical continuity between these two elements. Instead, 
pre- and postsynaptic components communicate via the 
secretion of molecules from the presynaptic terminal that 
bind to receptors in the postsynaptic cell. These molecules 
must traverse an interval of extracellular space between 
pre- and postsynaptic elements called the synaptic cleft. 
The synaptic cleft is not simply an empty space, but is the 
site of extracellular proteins that influence the diffusion, 
binding, and degradation of the molecules secreted by 
the presynaptic terminal (see Chapter 5). The number of 
synaptic inputs received by each nerve cell in the human 
nervous system varies from 1 to about 100,000. This range 
reflects a fundamental purpose of nerve cells: to relay and 
integrate information from other neurons in a neural cir- 
cuit. The number of synaptic contacts from different pre- 
synaptic neurons onto any particular cell is an especially 
important determinant of neuronal function. 
The information conveyed by synapses on the neuronal 
dendrites is integrated and "read out" at the origin of the 
axon, the portion of the nerve cell specialized for relaying 
electrical signals (see Figure 1.3B). The axon is a unique 
extension from the neuronal cell body that may travel a few 
hundred micrometers (um) or much farther, depending on 
the type of neuron and the size of the animal (some axons 
in large animals can be meters in length). The axon also 
has a distinct cytoskeleton whose elements are central for 
its functional integrity (Figure 1.4). Many nerve cells in the 
STUDYING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
7 
human brain have axons no more than a few millimeters 
long, and a few have no axons at all. 
Relatively short axons are a feature of local circuit neu- 
rons, or interneurons, throughout the brain. The axons of 
projection neurons, however, extend to distant targets. 
For example, the axons that run from the human spinal 
cord to the foot are about a meter long. The event that car- 
ries signals over such distances is a self-regenerating wave 
of electrical activity called an action potential, an all-or- 
nothing change in the electrical potential (voltage) across 
the nerve cell membrane that conveys information from 
one point to another in the nervous system (see Chapter 
2). An action potential propagates from its point of initia- 
tion at the cell body (the axon hillock) to the terminus of 
the axon, where synaptic contacts are made. The chemical 
and electrical processes by which the information encoded 
by action potentials is passed on at synaptic contacts to a 
target cell is called synaptic transmission (see Chapter 
5). Presynaptic terminals (also called synaptic endings, axon 
terminals, or terminal boutons; see Figure 1.3C) and their 
postsynaptic specializations are typically chemical syn- 
apses, the most abundant type of synapse in the nervous 
system. Another type, the electrical synapse (facilitated 
by the gap junctions mentioned above), is relatively rare 
and has special functions. 
The secretory organelles in the presynaptic terminal of 
chemical synapses are synaptic vesicles, spherical struc- 
tures filled with neurotransmitter molecules (or simply 
neurotransmitters). The positioning of synaptic vesicles 
at the presynaptic membrane and their fusion to initiate 
neurotransmitter release is regulated by a number of pro- 
teins (including several cytoskeletal proteins) either within 
or associated with the vesicle. The neurotransmitters re- 
leased from synaptic vesicles modify the electrical prop- 
erties of the target cell by binding to receptors localized 
primarily at postsynaptic specializations. The intricate and 
concerted activity of neurotransmitters, receptors, related 
cytoskeletal elements, and signal transduction molecules 
are the basis for nerve cells communicating with one an- 
other, and with effector cells in muscles and glands. 
Glial Cells 
Glial cells—usually referred to more simply as "glia"—are 
quite different from neurons. They are more numerous than 
neurons in the brain by a ratio of perhaps 3 to 1. Glia do not 
participate directly in synaptic interactions or in electrical 
signaling, although their supportive functions help define 
synaptic contacts and maintain the signaling abilities of 
neurons. Like nerve cells, glial cells have complex processes 
extending from their cell bodies, but these are generally less 
prominent and do not serve the same purposes as neuronal 
axons and dendrites. Cells with glial characteristics are the 
only apparent stem cells retained in the mature brain, and

are capable of giving rise both to new glia as well as—in 
a few instances—new neurons. 
The word glia is Greek for "glue" and reflects the 
nineteenth-century presumption that these cells "held 
the nervous system together." The term has survived 
despite the lack of any evidence that glial cells actu- 
ally bind nerve cells together. Glial functions that are 
well established include maintaining the ionic milieu of 
nerve cells; modulating the rate of netve signal propa- 
gation; modulating synaptic action by controlling the 
uptake and metabolism of neurotransmitters at or near 
the synaptic cleft; providing a scaffold for some aspects 
of neural development; and aiding (or in some instances 
impeding) recovery from neural injury. 
There are three types of differentiated glial cells in 
the mature nervous system: astrocytes, oligodendro- 
cytes, and microglial cells. Astrocytes, which are re- 
stricted to the central nervous system (i.e., the brain 
and spinal cord), have elaborate local processes that 
give these cells a starlike ("astral") appearance (Figures

directly from neural precursor cells). They share many 
properties with macrophages found in other tissues: they 
are primarily scavenger cells that remove cellular debris 
from sites of injury or normal cell turnover. In addition, 
microglia, like their macrophage counterparts, secrete sig- 
naling molecules—particularly a wide range of cytokines 
that are also produced by cells of the immune system—that 
can modulate local inflammation and influence cell survival 
or death. Indeed, some neurobiologists prefer to categorize 
microglia as a type of macrophage. Following brain dam- 
age, the number of microglia at the site of injury increases 
dramatically. Some of these cells proliferate from microglia 
resident in the brain, while others come from macrophages 
that migrate to the injured area and enter the brain via local 
disruptions in the cerebral vasculature. 
In addition to the three classes of differentiated glia, 
glial stem cells are also found throughout the adult brain. 
These cells retain the capacity to proliferate and generate 
additional precursors or differentiated glia and, in some 
cases, neurons. Glial stem cells in the mature brain can 
be divided into two categories: astrocytes found primarily 
near the ventricles in a region called the subventricular zone 
(SVZ) or adjacent to ventricular zone blood vessels (Figure 
1.5D); and oligodendroglial precursors scattered through- 
out the white matter and sometimes referred to as polyden- 
drocytes (Figure 1.5E). SVZ astrocytes, both in vivo and in 
vitro, can give rise to more stem cells, neurons, and mature 
astrocytes and oligodendroglial cells. Thus, they have the 
key properties of all stem cells: proliferation, self-renewal, 
and the capacity to make all cell classes of a particular tis- 
sue. Oligodendroglial precursors are more limited in their 
potential. In the living brain they give rise primarily to ma- 
ture oligodendroglial cells as well as to some astrocytes, 
although under some conditions in vitro they have been 
seen to generate neurons. 
The significance of active glial stem cells in the mature 
brain is unclear. They may reflect glial identity as a "default" 
for any proliferative cell derived from the embryonic precur- 
sors of the nervous system, or they may reflect distinctions 
in the differentiated state of neurons and glia that allow 
proliferation only in cells with glial characteristics. 
Cellular Diversity in the 
Nervous System 
Although the cellular constituents of the human nervous 
system are in many ways similar to those of other organs, 
they are unusual in their extraordinary numbers. The human 
brain is estimated to contain 100 billion neurons and sev- 
eral times as many glia. More important, the nervous system 
has a greater range of distinct cell types—whether catego- 
rized by morphology, molecular identity, or physiological 
role—than any other organ system (a fact that presumably 
explains why, as mentioned at the start of this chapter, so 
many different genes are expressed in the nervous system). 
The cellular diversity of any nervous system undoubtedly 
underlies the capacity of the system to form increasingly 
complicated networks and to mediate increasingly sophis- 
ticated behaviors. For much of the twentieth century, neuro- 
scientists relied on the set of techniques developed by Cajal, 
Golgi, and other pioneers of histology (the microscopic 
analysis of cells and tissues) and pathology to describe and 
categorize the diverse cell types in the nervous system. The 
staining method named for Golgi permitted visualization 
of individual nerve cells and their processes that had been 
impregnated, seemingly randomly, with silver salts (Figure 
1.6A,B). As a modern counterpart, fluorescent dyes and 
other soluble molecules injected into single neurons, often 
after physiological recording to identify the function of the 
cell, provide an alternative approach to visualizing single 
nerve cells and their processes (Figure 1.6C,D). 
As a complement to these approaches (which provide a 
random sample of only a few neurons and glia), other stains 
are used to demonstrate the distribution of all cell bodies— 
but not their processes or connections—in neural tissue. 
The widely used Niss] method is one such method; this 
technique stains the nucleolus and other structures (e.g., 
ribosomes) where DNA or RNA is found (Figure 1.6E). Such 
stains demonstrate that the size, density, and distribution 
of the total population of nerve cells are not uniform within 
the brain. In some regions, such as the cerebral cortex, cells 
are arranged in layers (Figure 1.6F,G), each layer defined 
by distinctive differences in cell density. Structures like the 
olfactory bulb display even more complicated arrangements 
of cell bodies (Figure 1.6H). Additional approaches, detailed 
later in the chapter, have provided further definition of dif- 
ferences between nerve cells from region to region. These 
include the identification of how subsets of neurons are 
connected to one another, and how molecular differences 
further distinguish classes of nerve cells in a variety of brain 
regions (see Figure 1.11). 
Neural Circuits 
Neurons never function in isolation; they are organized into 
ensembles called neural circuits that process specific kinds 
of information. Neural circuits are the foundation of sen- 
sation, perception, movement, and behavior. The synaptic 
connections that define neural circuits are typically made 
in a dense tangle of dendrites, axon terminals, and glial cell 
processes that together constitute what is called neuropil 
(Greek pilos, "felt"; see Figure 1.3C). The neuropil consti- 
tutes the regions between nerve cell bodies where most 
synaptic connectivity occurs. 
Although the arrangement of neural circuits varies 
greatly according to the function being served, some fea- 
tures are characteristic of all such ensembles. Preeminent 
is the direction of information flow in any particular circuit,

cell bodies, particularly those cells arranged in rings on the bulb's

which is obviously essential to understanding its purpose. 
Nerve cells that carry information from the periphery to- 
ward the brain or spinal cord (or deeper centrally within the 
spinal cord and brain) are called afferent neurons; nerve 
cells that carry information away from the brain or spinal 
cord (or away from the circuit in question) are efferent 
neurons. Interneurons (local circuit neurons; see above) 
participate only in the local aspects of a circuit, based on 
the short distances over which their axons extend. These 
three functional classes—afferent neurons, efferent neu- 
rons, and interneurons—are the basic constituents of all 
neural circuits. 
A simple example of a neural circuit is one that mediates 
the myotatic reflex, commonly known as the "knee-jerk" 
reflex (Figure 1.7). The afferent neurons that control the 
reflex are sensory neurons whose cell bodies lie in the pe- 
ripheral dorsal root ganglia and whose peripheral axons 
terminate in sensory endings in skeletal muscles. (The gan- 
glia that serve this same function for much of the head and 
neck are called cranial nerve ganglia; see the Appendix.) 
The central axons of these afferent sensory neurons enter 
the spinal cord, where they terminate on a variety of central 
neurons concerned with the regulation of muscle tone— 
most obviously on the motor neurons that determine the 
activity of the related muscles. These motor neurons con- 
stitute the efferent neurons. One group of motor neurons 
in the ventral horn of the spinal cord projects to the flexor 
muscles in the limb, the other to extensor muscles. Spinal 
cord interneurons are the third element of this circuit. The 
interneurons receive synaptic contacts from sensory af- 
ferent neurons and make synapses on the efferent motor

The "knee-jerk response," a simple reflex 
circuit. Formally known as the myotatic reflex, this response 
illustrates several points about the functional organization 
of neural circuits. Stimulation of peripheral sensors (a muscle 
stretch receptor in this case) initiates receptor potentials that 
trigger action potentials that travel centrally along the afferent 
axons of the sensory neurons. This information stimulates spinal 
motor neurons by means of synaptic contacts. The action poten- 
tials triggered by the synaptic potential in motor neurons travel 
peripherally in efferent axons, giving rise to muscle contraction 
and a behavioral response. One of the purposes of this particular 
reflex is to help maintain an upright posture in the face of unex- 
pected changes (such as tripping). 
neurons that project to the flexor muscles; thus they are 
capable of modulating the input-output linkage. The excit- 
atory synaptic connections between the sensory afferents 
and the extensor efferent motor neurons cause the extensor 
muscles to contract; at the same time, interneurons acti- 
vated by the afferents are inhibitory, and their activation 
diminishes electrical activity in flexor efferent motor neu- 
rons and causes the flexor muscles to become less active. 
The result is a complementary activation and inactivation 
of the synergistic and antagonistic muscles that control the 
position of the leg. 
A more detailed picture of the events underlying the 
myotatic or any other neural circuit can be obtained by 
electrophysiological recording, which measures the 
electrical activity of a nerve cell. There are two approaches 
to this method: extracellular recording, where an elec- 
trode is placed near the nerve cell of interest to detect its 
activity; and intracellular recording, where the electrode 
is placed inside the cell of interest. Extracellular recording 
is particularly useful for detecting temporal patterns of ac- 
tion potential activity and relating those patterns to stim- 
ulation by other inputs, or to specific behavioral events. 
Intracellular recording can detect the smaller, graded 
changes in electrical potential that trigger action poten- 
tials, and thus allow a more detailed analysis of commu- 
nication between neurons within a circuit. These graded 
triggering potentials can arise at either sensory receptors 
or synapses and are called receptor potentials or synap- 
tic potentials, respectively. 
For the myotatic circuit, electrical activity can be mea- 
sured both extracellularly and intracellularly, thus defining 
the functional relationships among the neurons in the cir- 
cuit. With electrodes placed near, but still outside 
of in- 
dividual cells, the pattern of action potential activity can 
be recorded extracellularly for each element of the circuit .

Extracellular recording shows the relative frequency of action 
potentials in the myotatic reflex. Action potentials are indicated by individual ver- 
tical lines. As a result of the stimulus, the sensory neuron is triggered to fire at higher 
frequency (i.e., more action potentials per unit of time). This increase triggers a higher 
frequency of action potentials in both the extensor motor neurons and the interneu- 
rons. Concurrently, the inhibitory synapses made by the interneurons onto the flexor 
motor neurons cause the frequency of action potentials in these cells to decline (a 
modulatory effect).

the onset, duration, and frequency of ac-

tional picture of the circuit emerges. Us- 
ing intracellular recording, it is possible to 
observe directly the changes in membrane 
potential underlying the synaptic connec- 
tions of each element of the myotatic reflex 
circuit (Figure 1.9). 
The Organization of the 
Human Nervous System 
Neural circuits that process similar types 
of information make up neural systems 
that serve broader purposes: The most 
general functional distinction divides 
such collections into sensory systems 
that acquire and process information from 
the environment (e.g., the visual system 
or the auditory system, both described in 
Unit Il); and motor systems that respond 
to such information by generating move- 
ments and other behavior (described in 
Unit II). There are, however, large num- 
bers of cells and circuits that lie between 
these relatively well defined input and 
output systems. These are collectively re- 
ferred to as associational systems, and 
they mediate the most complex and least 
well characterized brain functions (see 
Unit V). 
In addition to these broad functional 
distinctions, neuroscientists and neurolo- 
gists have conventionally divided the ver- 
tebrate nervous system anatomically into 
central and peripheral components (Fig- 
ure 1.10). The central nervous system, 
typically referred to as the CNS, com- 
prises the brain (cerebral hemispheres, 
diencephalon, cerebellum, and brainstem) 
and the spinal cord (see Appendix A for 
more information about the gross ana- 
tomical features of the CNS). The periph- 
eral nervous system (PNS) includes the 
sensory neurons that link sensory recep- 
tors on the body surface or deeper within 
it with relevant processing circuits in the 
central nervous system. The motor portion 
of the peripheral nervous system in turn 
consists of two components. The motor 
axons that connect the brain and spinal 
cord to skeletal muscles make up the so- 
matic motor division of the peripheral

nervous system, whereas the cells and axons that innervate 
smooth muscles, cardiac muscle, and glands make up the 
visceral or autonomic motor division. 
Those nerve cell bodies that reside in the peripheral ner- 
vous system are located in ganglia, which are simply local 
accumulations of nerve cell bodies and supporting cells. 
Peripheral axons are gathered into bundles called nerves, 
many of which are enveloped by the glial cells of the pe- 
ripheral nervous system; as mentioned earlier, these pe- 
ripheral glia are called Schwann cells. 
Nerve cells in the central nervous system are arranged 
in two different ways. Nuclei are local accumulations of 
neurons that have roughly similar connections and func- 
tions; such collections are found throughout the cerebrum, 
brainstem, and spinal cord. In contrast, cortex (plural, cor- 
tices) describes sheet-like arrays of nerve cells (consult Ap- 
pendix A for additional information and illustrations). The 
cortices of the cerebral hemispheres and of the cerebel- 
lum provide the clearest example of this organizational 
principle. 
Axons in the central nervous system are gathered into 
tracts that are more or less analogous to nerves in the pe- 
riphery. Tracts that cross the midline of the brain are re- 
ferred to as commissures. Two gross histological terms dis- 
tinguish regions rich in neuronal cell bodies versus regions 
rich in axons. Gray matter refers to any accumulation of

cell bodies and neuropil in the brain and spinal cord (e.g., 
nuclei or cortices). White matter (named for its relatively 
light appearance, the result of the lipid content of myelin) 
refers to axon tracts and commissures. 
The organization of the visceral motor division of the 
peripheral nervous system (the nerve cells that control the 
functions of the visceral organs including the heart, the lungs, 
the gastrointestinal tract, and the genitalia) is a bit more 
complicated (see Chapter 21). Visceral motor neurons in the 
brainstem and spinal cord—the so-called preganglionic neu- 
rons—form synapses with peripheral motor neurons that lie 
in the autonomic ganglia. The peripheral motor neurons 
in autonomic ganglia innervate smooth muscle, glands, and 
cardiac muscle, thus controlling most involuntary (visceral) 
behavior. In the sympathetic division of the autonomic mo- 
tor system, the ganglia lie along or in front of the vertebral 
column and send their axons to a variety of peripheral tar- 
gets. In the parasympathetic division, the ganglia are found 

within or adjacent to the organs they innervate. Another 
component of the visceral motor system, called the enteric 
system, is made up of small ganglia as well as individual 
neurons scattered throughout the wall of the gut. These neu- 
rons influence gastric motility and secretion. 
Details about the physical structures and overall anat- 
omy of the human nervous system can be found in the Ap- 
pendix to this book, as well as in the brief atlas of the central 
nervous system that follows the Appendix. 
Neural Systems 
Several characteristics distinguish neural systems within 
the complex array of anatomical components that make 
up any nervous system; primary among these are unity of 
function; representation of specific information; and subdivision 
into subsystems for the relay and processing information in 
parallel. The most important of these is the unity of func- 
tion evident in an interconnected ensemble of neurons. For 
example, the visual system is defined by all the neurons 
and connections dedicated to vision, the auditory system 
by those dedicated to hearing, the somatosensory system 
by those dedicated to the sense of touch, the pyramidal 
motor system by the neurons and connections dedicated 
to voluntary movement, and so on for many other identifi- 
able systems. In many instances, a system's components are 
distributed throughout the body and brain. Thus, sensory 
systems include peripheral sensory specializations in eye, 
ear, skin, nose, and tongue, while motor systems include 
the peripheral motor nerves and target muscles required to 
perform various actions. Both sensory and motor systems 
have nerve pathways that connect the periphery with nuclei 
in the spinal cord, brainstem, and thalamus, as well as the 
relevant areas of the cerebral cortex. 
Two other features of many neural systems are orderly 
representation of information at various levels, and a divi- 
sion of the function of the system into submodialities that 
are typically relayed and processed in parallel pathways, 
where information from each of the submodalities (e.g., the 
frequency and the volume of an auditory signal) is processed 
separately. For systems such as vision and touch—systems 
that function to distinguish differences between neighbor- 
ing points in the visual field or on the body's surface—the 
representation of information is topographic. Such repre- 
sentations, or topographic maps, reflect a point-to-point 
correspondence between the sensory periphery (the visual 
field or the body surface) and neighboring neurons within 
the central components of the system (in the spinal cord 
and brain). For neural systems where the representation 
of information does not entail discriminating neighboring 
points in a field—for example smell and taste—computa- 
tional maps compare, assess, and integrate multiple stimu- 
lus attributes into an orderly representation that facilitates 
the extraction and processing of essential information (e.g., 
STUDYING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
15 
the number and configuration of odorant molecules to de- 
termine the source and nature of a smell). Motor systems 
entail orderly representations of movements, although here 
the direction of information flow is from the central nervous 
system to the periphery. Parallel pathways arise because 
virtually all neural systems have identifiable subsystems. 
The human visual system, for instance, has subsystems that 
emphasize stimulus characteristics such as color, form, or 
motion, with each class of information relayed and pro- 
cessed separately to some degree. Similar segregation of 
information subtypes into parallel pathways is apparent in 
other sensory and motor systems. 
Finally, it is important to note that not all neural systems 
are as neatly organized as the primary sensory and motor 
systems. The systems serving language, attention, memory, 
and emotion are recognized by their unity of function and 
anatomical location, but how information is represented, 
their subsystems, and their inputs and outputs are all less 
well understood (see Unit V). 
Structural Analysis of Neural Systems 
Early observers of neural systems made inferences of func- 
tional localization (that is, which region of the nervous 
system serves which function) by correlating gross damage 
to brain structures observed post mortem with functional 
deficits recorded during the lifetime of the individual. This 
use of structure to infer function was adopted for experi- 
mentation, and much of neuroscience rests on observations 
made by purposefully damaging a distinct brain region, 
nerve, or tract in an experimental animal and observing and 
documenting the subsequent loss of function in single or 
interconnected regions. These lesion studies provide the 
foundation for much current understanding of the anatomy 
of neural systems. 
The more detailed contemporary view of neuroanatomy 
that defines neural systems emerged only after the advent 
of techniques to trace neural connections from their source 
to their termination (anterograde) or vice versa, from ter- 
minus to source (retrograde). These approaches permit de- 
tailed assessment of connections between various regions 
of the nervous system, thus facilitating the "mapping" of 
connections between neurons in one structure (for exam- 
ple, the eye) and their targets in the brain. Initially these 
techniques relied on physically injecting visualizable mol- 
ecules into the brain to be taken up by local cell bodies and 
transported to axon terminals, or taken up by local axons 
and terminals and transported back to the parent cell body 
(Figure 1.11A,B). Other tracers can demonstrate an entire 
network of axonal projections from nerve cells exposed to 
the tracer (Figure 1.11C). Together these approaches per- 
mit assessment of the extent of connections from a single 
population of nerve cells to their targets throughout the 
nervous system.

CHAPTER 1

Analyses of connectivity have been augmented by mo- 
lecularly based histochemical techniques that demonstrate 
biochemical and genetic distinctions among nerve cells and 
their processes. Whereas general cell staining methods pri- 
marily show differences in cell size and distribution, antibody 
stains can recognize specific proteins in different regions of 
anerve cell, or molecular differences in classes of nerve cells. 
These approaches have clarified the functional distribution of 
synapses, dendrites, and other molecular distinguishing fea- 
tures of nerve cell types in a variety of brain regions (Figure 
1.11D,B). In addition, antibodies against various proteins, as 
well as probes for specific mRNA transcripts (which detect 
gene expression in the relevant cells), have been used for 
similar purposes (Figure 1.11F). More recently still, molecular 
genetic and neuroanatomical methods have been combined 
to visualize the expression of fluorescent or other tracer mol- 
ecules under the control of regulatory sequences of neural 
genes (Figure 1.12). This approach illuminates individual 
cells in fixed or living tissue in remarkable detail, allow- 
ing nerve cells and their processes to be identified by their

transcriptional state (i.e., which genes are being transcribed 
in that cell) as well as their structure and connections. These 
techniques allow molecular distinctions to be made between 
otherwise equivalent nerve cells. Thus, a variety of molecular 
and genetic engineering approaches now allow researchers 
to trace connections between defined populations of neurons 
and their targets. The use of several approaches—pathway 
tracing, analysis of molecular identity of nerve cells, and ge- 
netic approaches to identifying cell identities and connec- 
tions—is now routine in the ongoing study of how neurons 
and glia are organized into functional neural circuits and 
neural systems. 
Functional Analysis of 
Neural Systems 
Functional analyses provide another powerful way of un- 
derstanding the organization of the nervous system. Di- 
verse physiological methods are now available to evaluate 
the electrical and metabolic activity of the neuronal circuits 
that make up a neural system. Two approaches—electro- 
physiological recording and functional brain imaging—have 
been particularly useful in defining how neural systems 
represent information. 
The most widely used electrophysiological method has 
been single-cell, or single-unit, electrophysiological record- 
ing with microelectrodes as discussed earlier in the chapter. 
(see Figures 1.8 and 1.9). This method often records from

several nearby cells in addition to the one selected, pro- 
viding further useful information. The use of microelec- 
trodes to record action potential activity allows cell-by-cell 
analysis of the organization of topographic maps, and can 
give specific insight into the type of stimulus to which the 
neuron is "tuned" (i.e., the stimulus that elicits a maximal 
change in action potential activity from the baseline state). 
Such tuning defines a neuron's receptive field—the region 
in sensory space (e.g., the body surface, or a specialized

to evaluate the relationship between stimuli and neuro- 
nal responses in both sensory and motor systems. Electri-

multiple cell analysis in animals performing complex cogni- 
tive tasks, intracellular recordings in intact animals, and the 
use of patch electrodes to detect and monitor the activity of 
the individual membrane molecules that ultimately under- 
lie neural signaling (see Chapters 2 and 3). 
The second area in which remarkable technical advances 
have been made is functional brain imaging (Box 1B). Over 
the last three decades, use of the techniques of functional 
brain imaging in human subjects (and, to a lesser extent, 
in experimental animals) has revolutionized both our 
understanding of neural systems and our ability to describe 
and diagnose functional abnormalities. Unlike electrophysi- 
ological methods of recording neural activity, which require 
exposing the brain or some other part of the nervous system 
and inserting electrodes, functional imaging is noninvasive 
and thus applicable to both clinical patients and normal hu- 
man subjects. Although functional imaging cannot resolve 
the electrical activity of individual neurons, it does record 
the local metabolic activity within small volumes of brain 
tissue. Accordingly, this approach allows the simultaneous 
BOX 1B Brain Imaging Techniques 
Until the end of the last century, much 
_ of our understanding of the structure 
and function of the healthy or diseased 
_ human brain was either discerned from 
_ the study of post mortem human speci- 
_ mens or inferred from animal studies. 
While these approaches were informa- 
tive, there were concerns that such 
information failed to convey the full 
functional capacity of the human brain, 
especially while performing complex 
tasks such as communication using lan- 
guage. The advent of several new tech- 
niques for imaging the anatomical and 
functional details of the human brain 
have confirmed many of the conclu- 
sions drawn from post mortem and ani- 
mal studies, but they have also opened 
new avenues for understanding how 
_ the brain performs in healthy subjects 
as well as in clinical patients. 
Computerized Tomography (CT) 
In the 1970s, computerized tomog- 
raphy, or CT, ushered in a new era in 
noninvasive imaging using computer 
processing technology to probe the liv- 
ing brain. Prior to CT, the only brain 
imaging technique available was stan- 
dard X-ray film, which has poor soft tis- 
sue contrast and involves relatively high 
radiation exposure. 
The CT approach uses a narrow 
X-ray beam and a row of very sensi- 
tive detectors placed on opposite sides 
of the head to probe a small portion 
of tissue at a time with limited radia- 
tion exposure (Figure A). In order to 
form an image, the X-ray tube and 
detectors rotate around the head, col- 
lecting radiodensity information from 
every orientation around a narrow 
slice. Computer processing techniques 
then calculate the radiodensity of each 
point within the slice plane, produc- 
ing a tomographic image (Greek tomo, 
"cut" or "slice"). If the patient is moved 
through the scanner slowly while the 
X-ray tube rotates in this manner, a 
i en veermt 
three-dimensional radiodensity matrix 
can be created, allowing images to be 
computed for any plane through the 
brain. CT scans can readily distinguish 
gray matter and white matter, differen- 
tiate the ventricles quite well, and show 
many other brain structures with a spa- 
tial resolution of several millimeters. 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) 
Brain imaging took a huge step forward 
in the 1980s with the development of 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
MRI is based on the fact that the nuclei 
of some atoms act as spinning magnets, 
and that if placed in a strong magnetic 
field these atoms will line up with the 
field and spin at a frequency that is 
dependent on the field strength. If a 
brief radiofrequency pulse tuned to 
atoms' spinning frequency is applied, 
they are knocked out of alignment 
with the field and subsequently emit 
energy in an oscillatory fashion as they 
gradually realign themselves with the 
field. The strength of the emitted signal 
depends on how many atomic nuclei 
are affected by this process. 
In MRI, the magnetic fjeld is distort- 
ed slightly by imposing magnetic gra- 
dients along three different spatial axes 
so that only nuclei at certain locations 
are tuned to the detector's frequency at 
any given time. Almost all MRI scan- 
ners use detectors tuned to the radio 
frequencies of spinning hydrogen nuclei 
in water molecules, creating images

moved around the patient's head. The inset shows a horizontal CT 
section of a normal adult brain. 

based on the distribution of water in 
_ different tissues. Careful manipulation 
_ of magnetic field gradients and radio- 
_ frequency pulses make it possible to 
_ construct extraordinarily detailed spatial 
images of the brain at any location and 
_ 
orientation, with sub-millimeter resolu- 
tion (Figure B). 
Safety and versatility have made 
MRI the technique of choice for imag- 
ing brain structure in most applica- 
tions. The strong magnetic field and 
_ radiofrequency pulses used in scanning 
_ 
are harmless, making this technique 
completely noninvasive (although 
_ metal objects in or near the scanner 
are a safety concern). MRI is versatile 
because, by changing the scanning 
| parameters, images based on a wide 
variety of different contrast mechanisms 
can be generated. For example, conven- 
_ tional MR imaging take advantage of 
the fact that hydrogen in different types 
of tissue (e.g., gray matter, white mat- 
ter, cerebrospinal fluid) have slightly 
different realignment rates, meaning 
that soft tissue contrast can be manipu- 
lated by adjusting the time at which the 
_ realigning hydrogen signal is measured. 
The alignment of the magnetic fields 
of water molecules in axon tracts makes 
STUDYING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
19 
it possible to visualize axon pathways 
using a variant of MRI referred to as 
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), seen 
in the image that opens this chapter. 
DTI imaging can establish differences 
in axon pathway connectivity, making it 
possible to study patients with genetic 
disorders that result in major altera- 
tions of axon projections (see Box 23B). 
Additional parameter settings can gen- 
erate images in which gray and white 
matter are relatively invisible but the 
brain vasculature stands out in sharp 
detail. 
Functional Brain Imaging 
Imaging functional variations in the 
living brain has become possible with 
the recent development of techniques 
for detecting small, localized changes 
in metabolism or cerebral blood flow. 
To conserve energy, the brain regulates 
its blood flow such that active neurons 
with relatively high metabolic demands 
receive more blood than relatively inac- 
tive neurons. Detecting and mapping 
these local changes in cerebral blood 
flow forms the basis for three widely 
used functional brain imaging tech- 
niques: positron emission tomogra- 
phy (PET), single-photon emission

In PET scanning, unstable positron-

around the head register a "hit" only 
when two detectors 180 degrees apart 
react simultaneously. Images of tissue 
isotope density can then be generated 
(much the way CT images are calcu- 
lated) showing the location of active 
regions with a spatial resolution of about 
4 mm. Depending on the probe injected, 
PET imaging can be used to visualize 
activity-dependent changes in blood 
flow, tissue metabolism, or biochemical 
activity. SPECT imaging is similar to PET 
in that it involves injection or inhalation 
of radiolabeled compound (for example, 
33Xe or I-labeled iodoamphetamine), 
which produce photons that are detect- 
ed by a gamma camera moving rapidly 
around the head. 
Functional MRI, a variant of MRI, 
currently offers the best approach for 
visualizing brain function based on local 
metabolism. fMRI is predicated on the 
fact that hemoglobin in blood slightly 
distorts the magnetic resonance proper- 
ties of hydrogen nuclei in its vicinity, 
and the amount of magnetic distor- 
tion changes depending on whether 
the hemoglobin has oxygen bound to 
it. When a brain area is activated by 
a specific task it begins to use more

oxygen and within seconds the brain 
microvasculature responds by increas- 
ing the flow of oxygen-rich blood to 
the active area. These changes in the 
concentration of oxygen and blood flow 
lead to localized blood oxygenation 
level-dependent (BOLD) changes in the 
magnetic resonance signal. Such fluc- 
tuations are detected using statistical 
image processing techniques to produce 
maps of task-dependent brain function 
(Figure C). Because fMRI uses signals 
intrinsic to the brain without any radio- 
activity, repeated observations can be 
made on the same individual—a major 
advantage over imaging methods such 
as PET. The spatial resolution (2-3 mm) 
and temporal resolution (a few seconds) 
of {MRI are superior to PET and SPECT, 
and can be easily combined with struc- 
tural images generated by MRI. fMRI 
has thus emerged as the technology of 
choice for probing both the structure 
and function of the living human brain. 
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) 
provides a way of localizing brain func- 
tion with better temporal resolution. 
Thus, MEG is sometimes used to map 
changes in brain function with mil- 
lisecond resolution rather than the 
lower temporal resolution of seconds 
afforded by fMRI. MEG, as its name 
suggests, records the magnetic conse- 
quences of brain electric activity rather 
than the electrical signals themselves. 
Thus, unlike its close relative electro- 
encephalography (EEG), MEG detects 
independent sources of current flow, 
without reference to other currents. The 
magnetic signals that MEG recordings 
detect are quite local, and there is fairly 
good spatial resolution (0.1-1 cm) of 
the signal origin; thus, one can detect 
dynamic electrical activity in the brain 
with temporal resolution that approxi- 
mates the key events in neuronal elec- 
trical signaling—i.e., action potentials 
and synaptic potentials—and record the 
location of the source of that activity. 
To obtain an MEG recording, an 
array of individual detector devices 
called SQUIDs ("superconduct- 
ing quantum interference device) is 
arranged as a helmet and fitted onto 
the subject. The subject is then placed 
in a biomagnetometer scanner that 
amplifies the signals detected by the 
SQUID array. These signals, like EEG 
signals, provide a map of current sourc- 
es across the brain, using reference 
points (usually the ears and nose) to 
create a three-dimensional space. Since 
such maps lack anatomical detail, MEG 
is often combined with MRI, a combi- 
nation referred to as magnetic source 
imaging, or MSI. 
The use of modern structural and 
functional imaging methods has revolu- 
tionized human neuroscience. Today it 
is possible to obtain images of the living 
brain in action, and to assess changes 
in brain activity both in healthy subjects 
and in patients with disorders ranging 
from autism to Alzheimer's disease.

Analyzing Complex Behavior 
Many widely heralded advances in modern neuroscience 
have involved reducing the complexity of the brain to more 
readily analyzed components—i.e., genes, molecules, and 
cells, But more complex brain functions such as perception, 
language, emotion, memory, and consciousness remain a 
challenge for contemporary neuroscientists. Over the last 
25 years or so, a new field called cognitive neuroscience 
has emerged that is specifically devoted to understanding 
these issues (see Unit V). This field's evolution has also re- 
juvenated the study of neuroethology, which is devoted 
to observing complex behaviors of animals in their native 
environments—for example, social communication in birds 
and non-human primates—and has encouraged the devel- 
opment of tasks to better evaluate the genesis of complex 
human behaviors. When used in combination with func- 
tional imaging, well designed behavioral tasks can facilitate 
identification of brain systems (or networks if there is insuf- 
ficient evidence of unitary function; see above) devoted to 
complex functions such as language, mathematical and mu- 
sical ability, emotional responses, aesthetic judgments, and 
even abstract thinking. Carefully constructed behavioral 
tasks can also be used to study the pathology of complex 
neurological disorders that compromise cognition, such as 
Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression. These 
new or revitalized efforts use increasingly powerful tech- 
niques to study "higher" brain functions in both animal 
models and humans and offer new ways of beginning to 
understand the most complex aspects of behavior. 
Summary 
The brain can be studied by methods ranging from genetics 
and molecular biology to behavioral testing of human sub- 
jects. In addition to an ever increasing store of knowledge 
about the anatomical organization of the nervous system, 
many of the most notable successes of modern neuroscience 
have come from understanding nerve cells as the structural 
and functional units of the nervous system. Studies of the 
cellular architecture and molecular components of neurons 
STUDYING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

and glia have revealed much about their individual func- 
tions at a detailed level, providing a basis for understanding 
how nerve cells are organized into neural circuits, and these 
circuits into neural systems that process specific types of 
information pertinent to sensory processing and behavioral 
responses. Among the goals that remain are understand- 
ing how basic molecular genetic phenomena are linked to 
cellular, circuit, and system functions; understanding how 
these processes go awry in neurological and psychiatric dis- 
eases; and understanding the especially complex functions 
of the brain that make us human.

Signaling 
THE BRAIN IS REMARKABLY ADEPT at acquiring, coor- 
dinating, and disseminating information about the body and 
its environment. Such information must be processed within 
milliseconds, yet it also can be stored as memories that endure 
for years. Neurons perform these functions by generating 
sophisticated electrical and chemical signals. This unit describes 
these signals and how they are produced. It explains how one 
type of electrical signal, the action potential, allows information 
to travel along the length of a nerve cell. It also explains how 
other types of signals—both electrical and chemical—are gen- 
erated at synaptic connections between nerve cells. Synapses 
permit information transfer by interconnecting neurons to form 
the circuitry on which neural processing depends. Finally, this 
unit describes the intricate biochemical signaling events that 
take place within neurons and how such signaling can pro- 
duce activity-dependent changes in synaptic communication. 
Understanding these fundamental forms of neuronal signaling 
provides a foundation for appreciating the higher level func- 
tions considered in the rest of the book. 
The cellular and molecular mechanisms that give neurons 
their unique signaling abilities are also targets for disease pro- 
cesses that compromise the function of the nervous system. 
A working knowledge of the cellular and molecular biology of 
neurons is therefore fundamental to understanding a variety 
of brain pathologies, and for developing novel approaches to 
diagnosing and treating these all too prevalent problems.

ELECTRICAL SIGNALS 
OF NERVE CELLS 
Overview 
NERVE CELLS GENERATE A VARIETY of electrical signals that transmit and store 
information. Although neurons are not intrinsically good conductors of electricity, 
they have elaborate mechanisms that generate electrical signals based on the flow 
of ions across their plasma membranes. Ordinarily, neurons generate a negative 
potential, called the resting membrane potential, that can be measured by record- 
ing the voltage between the inside and outside of nerve cells. The action potential 
transiently abolishes the negative resting potential and makes the transmembrane 
potential positive. Action potentials are propagated along the length of axons, and 
these are the fundamental signals that carry information from one place to another 
in the nervous system. Still other types of electrical signals are produced by the ac- 
tivation of synaptic contacts between neurons or by the actions of external forms of 
energy on sensory neurons. All of these electrical signals arise from ion fluxes brought 
about by the selective permeability of nerve cell membranes to different ions and the 
non-uniform distribution of these ions across the membrane. 
Electrical Signals of Nerve Cells 
Neurons employ several different types of electrical signals to encode and transfer 
information. The best way to observe these signals is to use an intracellular micro- 
electrode to measure the electrical potential across the neuronal plasma membrane. 
A typical microelectrode is a piece of glass tubing pulled to a very fine point (with an 
opening less than 1 um in diameter) and filled with a good electrical conductor, such 
as a concentrated salt solution. This conductive core can then be connected to a volt- 
meter, typically a computer, that records the transmembrane voltage of the nerve cell. 
The first type of electrical phenomenon can be observed as soon as a microelec- 
trode is inserted through the membrane of the neuron. Upon entering the cell, the 
microelectrode reports a negative potential, indicating that neurons have a means 
of generating a constant voltage across their membranes when at rest. This voltage, 
called the resting membrane potential, depends on the type of neuron being ex- 
amined, but it is always a fraction of a volt (typically -40 to -90 mV).

The electrical signals produced by neurons are caused by 
responses to stimuli, which then change the resting mem- 
brane potential. Receptor potentials are due to the activa- 
tion of sensory neurons by external stimuli, such as light, 
sound, or heat. For example, touching the skin activates Pa- 
cinian corpuscles, receptor neurons that sense mechanical 
disturbances of the skin. These neurons respond to touch 
with a receptor potential that changes the resting poten- 
tial for a fraction of a second (Figure 2.1A). These transient 
changes in potential are the first step in generating the sen- 
sation of vibrations (or "tickles") of the skin in the somatic 
sensory system (see Chapter 9). Similar sorts of receptor 
potentials are observed in all other sensory neurons during 
transduction of sensory signals (see Unit II). 
Another type of electrical signal is associated with com- 
munication between neurons at synaptic contacts. Activa- 
tion of these synapses generates synaptic potentials, which 
allow transmission of information from one neuron to an- 
other. An example of such a signal is shown in Figure 2.1B. 
In this case, activation of a synaptic terminal innervating a

to measure changes in the resting membrane

brief touch causes a receptor potential in a 
Pacinian corpuscle in the skin. (B) Activation 
of a synaptic contact onto a hippocampal 
pyramidal neuron elicits a synaptic potential. 
(C) Stimulation of a spinal reflex produces an 
action potential in a spinal motor-neuron. 
hippocampal pyramidal neuron causes 
a very brief change in the resting mem- 
brane potential in the pyramidal neuron. 
Synaptic potentials serve as the means of 
exchanging information in complex neural 
circuits in both the central and peripheral 
nervous systems (see Chapter 5). 
Finally, neurons generate a special type 
of electrical signal that travels along their 
long axons. Such signals are called ac- 
tion potentials and are also referred to as 
"spikes" or "impulses." An example of an 
action potential recorded from the axon of 
a spinal motor neuron is shown in Figure 
2.1C. Action potentials are responsible for 
3 
io 
long-range transmission of information 
within the nervous system and allow the 
nervous system to transmit information to 
its target organs, such as muscle. 
One way to elicit an action potential is to pass electrical 
current across the membrane of the neuron. In normal cir- 
cumstances, this current would be generated by receptor po- 
tentials or by synaptic potentials. In the laboratory, however, 
electrical current suitable for initiating an action potential can 
be readily produced by inserting a second microelectrode into 
the same neuron and then connecting the electrode to a bat- 
tery (Figure 2.2A). If the current delivered in this way makes 
the membrane potential more negative (hyperpolarization), 
nothing very dramatic happens. The membrane potential 
simply changes in proportion to the magnitude of the in- 
jected current (central part of Figure 2.2B). Such hyperpolar- 
izing responses do not require any unique property of neu- 
rons and are therefore called passive electrical responses. A 
much more interesting phenomenon is seen if current of the 
opposite polarity is delivered, so that the membrane poten- 
tial of the nerve cell becomes more positive than the resting 
potential (depolarization). In this case, at a certain level of 
membrane potential, called the threshold potential, action 
potentials occur (see the right side of Figure 2.2B).

Recording passive and active electrical 
signals in a nerve cell. (A) Two microelectrodes are inserted 
into a neuron; one of these measures membrane potential while 
the other injects current into the neuron. (B) Inserting the volt- 
age-measuring microelectrode into the neuron reveals a nega- 
tive potential, the resting membrane potential. Injecting current 
through the current-passing microelectrode alters the neuronal 
membrane potential. Hyperpolarizing current pulses produce 
only passive changes in the membrane potential. While small 
depolarizing currents also elicit only passive responses, depolar- 
izations that cause the membrane potential to meet or exceed 
threshold additionally evoke action potentials. Action potentials 
are active responses in the sense that they are generated by 
changes in the permeability of the neuronal membrane. 
The action potential is an active response generated 
by the neuron and typically is a brief (about 1 ms) change 
from negative to positive in the transmembrane potential. 
Importantly, the amplitude of the action potential is inde- 
pendent of the magnitude of the current used to evoke it; 
that is, larger currents do not elicit larger action potentials. 
The action potentials of a given neuron are therefore said 
to be all-or-none—that is, they occur fully or not at all. If the 
amplitude or duration of the stimulus current is increased 
sufficiently, multiple action potentials occur, as can be seen 
in the responses to the three different current intensities 
shown in Figure 2.2B (right side). It follows, therefore, 
that the intensity of a stimulus is encoded in the frequency 
of action potentials rather than in their amplitude. This 
Time ——~> 
arrangement differs dramatically from that of receptor po- 
tentials, whose amplitudes are graded in proportion to the 
magnitude of the sensory stimulus; and from that of syn- 
aptic potentials, whose amplitudes vary according to the 
number of synapses activated, the strength of each synapse, 
and the previous amount of synaptic activity. 
Long-Distance Transmission of 
Electrical Signals 
The use of electrical signals—as in sending electricity over 
wires to provide power or information—presents a series of 
problems in electrical engineering. A fundamental problem 
for neurons is that their axons, which can be quite long 
(remember that a spinal motor neuron can extend for a me- 
ter or more), are not good electrical conductors. Although 
neurons and wires are both capable of passively conduct- 
ing electricity, the electrical properties of neurons compare 
poorly to an ordinary wire. This can be seen by measuring 
the passive electrical properties of a nerve cell axon by de- 
termining the voltage change resulting from a current pulse 
passed across the axonal membrane (Figure 2.3A; see also 
Box 2A). If this current pulse is below the threshold for gen- 
erating an action potential, then the magnitude of the re- 
sulting potential change will decay with increasing distance 
from the site of current injection (Figure 2.3B). Typically, 
the potential falls to a small fraction of its initial value at a 
distance of no more than a couple of millimeters away from 
the site of injection (Figure 2.3C). For comparison, a wire

Passive and active current flow in an axon. 
(A) Experimental arrangement for examining passive flow of 
electrical current in an axon. A current-passing electrode pro- 
duces a current that yields a subthreshold change in membrane 
potential, which spreads passively along the axon. (B) Potential 
responses recorded at the positions indicated by microelec- 
trodes. With increasing distance from the site of current injection, 
the amplitude of the potential change is attenuated as current 
leaks out of the axon. (C) Relationship between the amplitude of

(A) is repeated with a suprathreshold current, an active response, 
the action potential, is evoked. (E) Action potentials recorded 
at the positions indicated by microelectrodes. The amplitude 
of the action potential is constant along the length of the axon, 
although the time of appearance of the action potential is 
delayed with increasing distance. (F) The constant amplitude of 
an action potential (solid black line) measured at different dis- 
tances. (After Hodgkin and Rushton, 1938.) 
would typically allow passive current flow over distances 
thousands of times longer. The progressive decrease in the 
amplitude of the induced potential change occurs because 
the injected current leaks out across the axonal membrane; 
accordingly, farther along the axon less current is available 
to change the membrane potential. This leakiness of the 
axonal membrane prevents effective passive conduction of 
electrical signals in all but the shortest axons (those 1 mm 
or less in length). To compensate for this deficiency, action 
potentials serve as a "booster system" that allows neurons 
to conduct electrical signals over great distances despite the 
poor passive electrical properties of axons. 
The ability of action potentials to boost the spatial spread 
of electrical signals can be seen if the experiment shown in 
Figure 2.3A is repeated with a depolarizing current pulse 
that is large enough to produce an action potential (Fig- 
ure 2.3D). In this case, the result is dramatically different. 
Now an action potential of constant amplitude is observed 
along the entire length of the axon (Figure 2.3E). The fact

that electrical signaling now occurs without any decrement 
(Figure 2.3F) indicates that active conduction via action po- 
tentials is a very effective way to circumvent the inherent 
leakiness of neurons. 
Because action potentials are the basis of information 
transfer in the nervous system, it is essential to understand 
how these and other neuronal electrical signals arise. Re- 
markably, all types of neuronal electrical signals are pro- 
duced by similar mechanisms that rely upon the movement 
of ions across the neuronal membrane. The remainder of 
this chapter addresses the question of how nerve cells use 
ions to generate electrical potentials. Chapter 3 explores 
more specifically the means by which action potentials are 
produced and how these signals solve the problem of long- 
distance electrical conduction within nerve cells. Chapter 4 
examines the properties of membrane molecules respon- 
sible for electrical signaling. Finally, Chapters 5-8 consider 
how electrical signals are transmitted from one nerve cell 
to another at synaptic contacts. 
How lon Movements Produce 
Electrical Signals 
Electrical potentials are generated across the membranes 
of neurons—and, indeed, across the membranes of all 
cells—because (1) there are differences in the concentrations of 
specific ions across nerve cell membranes, and (2) the mem- 
branes are selectively permeable to some of these ions. These 
two facts depend in turn on two different kinds of proteins 
in the cell membrane (Figure 2.4). The ion concentration 
gradients are established by proteins known as active 
transporters, which, as their name suggests, actively move 
ions into or out of cells against their concentration gradi- 
ents. The selective permeability of membranes is due largely 
to ion channels, proteins that allow only certain kinds of 
ions to cross the membrane in the direction of their concen- 
tration gradients. Thus, channels and transporters basically 
work against each other, and in so doing they generate the 
FIGURE 2.4 
Active transporters and 
ion channels are responsible for ionic 
movements across neuronal membranes. 
Transporters create ion concentration differ- 
ences by actively transporting ions against 
their chemical gradients. Channels take advan- 
tage of these concentration gradients, allow- 
ing selected ions to move, via diffusion, down 
their chemical gradients.

_ The passive flow of electrical current 
_ plays a central role in action potential 
» 
_ propagation, synaptic transmission, and 
all other forms of electrical signaling in 
_ nerve cells. Therefore, it is worthwhile 
_ understanding in quantitative terms 
_ how passive current flow varies with 
_ distance along a neuron. For the case 
- of a cylindrical axon, such as the one 
_ depicted in Figure 2.3, subthreshold 
' current injected into one part of the 
_ axon spreads passively along the axon 
_ until the current is dissipated by leak- 
_ age out across the axon membrane. 
_ As a result of this leakage, potentials 
_ measured along the length of the axon 
get smaller with distance from the site 
where current is injected (Figure A). 
_ The decrement in the current flow with 
distance can be determined by plotting 
_ the relative reduction in the amplitude 
of potentials over distance (Figure B). 
This relationship is described by a sim- 
ple exponential function: 
Veal, elk 
where V. is the voltage response at any 
distance x along the axon, V, is the volt- 
age change at the point where current 
is injected into the axon, e is the base 
of natural logarithms (approximately 
_ 
2.7), and i is the length constant of 
the axon. As evident in this relation- 
ship, the length constant is the distance 
where the initial voltage response (V,) 
decays to 1/e (or 37%) of its value. 
The length constant is thus a way to 
characterize how far passive current 
flow spreads before it leaks out of the 
axon, with leakier axons having shorter 
length constants. 
The length constant depends upon 
the physical properties of the axon, in 
BOX 2A Passive Membrane Properties 
particular the relative resistances of the 
plasma membrane (r,,), the intracel- 
lular axoplasm (7;), and the extracellular 
medium (7). The relationship between 
these parameters is 
- 
m 
1, +f, 
Hence, to improve the passive flow of 
current along an axon, the resistance 
of the plasma membrane should be as 
high as possible, and the resistances of 
the axoplasm and extracellular medium 
should be low. 
Another important consequence of 
the passive properties of neurons is that 
currents flowing across a membrane do 
not immediately change the membrane 
potential. For example, when a rectan- 
gular current pulse is injected into the 
axon shown in the experiment illus- 
trated in Figure 2.3A, the membrane 
potential depolarizes slowly over a few 
(A) 
milliseconds and then repolarizes over 
a similar time course when the current 
pulse ends (see Figure A). These delays 
in changing the membrane potential 
are due to the fact that the plasma 
membrane behaves as a capacitor, stor- 
ing the initial charge that flows at the 
beginning and end of the current pulse. 
For the case of a cell whose mem- 
brane potential is spatially uniform, the 
change in the membrane potential at 
any time, V, after beginning the current 
pulse (Figure C) can also be described 
by an exponential relationship: 
Vz = Voo(1 — eT) 
where V, is the steady-state value of 
the membrane potential change, t is 
the time after the current pulse begins, 
and t is the membrane time constant. 
The time constant is thus defined as 
the time when the voltage response (V) 
rises to 1 — (1/e) (or 63%) of V,. After 
the current pulse ends, the membrane

outside compartment (initial conditions) until the electromotive 
force acting on K* balances the concentration gradient, and the 
net movement of K* becomes zero (at equilibrium). (C) The rela- 
tionship between the transmembrane concentration gradient

ence in the concentration gradient. 
potential will be measured across it (Figure 2.5A). However, 
if the concentration of K* is not the same on the two sides, 
then an electrical potential will be generated. For instance, 
if the concentration of K* in the inside compartment is 10 
times higher than the K* concentration in the outside com- 
partment, then the electrical potential of the inside will be 
negative relative to the outside (Figure 2.5B). This difference 
in electrical potential is generated because the potassium 
ions flow down their concentration gradient and take their 
electrical charge (one positive charge per ion) with them 
as they go. Because neuronal membranes contain pumps 
that accumulate K* in the cell cytoplasm, and because 
potassium-permeable channels in the plasma membrane 
allow a transmembrane flow of K*, an analogous situation 
exists in living nerve cells. A continual resting efflux of K* is 
therefore responsible for the resting membrane potential. 
In the hypothetical case just described, an equilibrium 
will quickly be reached. As K* moves from the inside com- 
partment to the outside (the initial conditions; shown on 
the left in Figure 2.5B), a potential is generated that tends

to impede further flow of K*. This impediment results from 
the fact that the potential gradient across the membrane 
tends to repel the positive potassium ions that would oth- 
erwise move across the membrane. Thus, as the outside 
becomes positive relative to the inside, the increasing pos- 
itivity makes the outside less attractive to the positively 
charged K*. The net movement (or flux) of K* will stop 
at the point ("at equilibrium" in the right panel of Figure 
2.5B) where the potential change across the membrane 
(the relative positivity of the outside compartment) exactly 
offsets the concentration gradient (the tenfold excess of 
K* in the inside compartment). At this electrochemical 
equilibrium, there is an exact balance between two op- 
posing forces: (1) the concentration gradient that causes 
K* to move from inside to outside, taking along positive 
charge,.and (2) an opposing electrical gradient that in- 
creasingly tends to stop K* from moving across the mem- 
brane (see Figure 2.5B). The number of ions that needs 
to flow to generate this electrical potential is very small 
(approximately 10-" moles of K* per cm? of membrane, or 
10" K* ions). This last fact is significant in two ways. First, 
it means that the concentrations of permeant ions on each 
side of the membrane remain essentially constant, even 
after the flow of ions has generated the potential. Second, 
the tiny fluxes of ions required to establish the membrane 
potential do not disrupt chemical electroneutrality because 
each ion has an oppositely charged counter-ion (chloride 
ions in Figure 2.5) to maintain the neutrality of the solu- 
tions on each side of the membrane. The concentration of 
K* remains equal to the concentration of Cl- in the solu- 
tions in both compartments, meaning that the separation 
of charge that creates the potential difference is restricted. 
to the immediate vicinity of the membrane. 

Forces That Create Membrane 
Potentials 
The electrical potential generated across the membrane at 
electrochemical equilibrium—the equilibrium potential— 
can be predicted by a simple formula called the Nernst 
equation. This relationship is generally expressed as 
pet 
[X] on 
= —:- in-— 
peace 
|X|. 
where E, is the equilibrium potential for any ion X, R is the 
gas constant, T is the absolute temperature (in degrees on 
the Kelvin scale), z is the valence (electrical charge) of the 
permeant ion, and F is the Faraday constant (the amount 
of electrical charge contained in one mole of a univalent 
ion). The brackets indicate the concentrations of ion X on 
each side of the membrane, with "in" referring to the inside 
compartment and "out" referring to the outside, and the 
symbol In indicates the natural logarithm of the concentra- 
tion gradient. Because it is easier to perform calculations 
using base 10 logarithms and to perform experiments at 
room temperature, this relationship is usually simplified to 
where log indicates the base 10 logarithm of the concentra- 
tion ratio. Thus, for the example in Figure 2.5B, the potential 
across the membrane at electrochemical equilibrium is

The equilibrium potential is conventionally defined in 
terms of the potential difference between the outside and 
inside compartments. Thus, when the concentration of K* 
is higher inside than out, an inside-negative potential is 
measured across the K*-permeable neuronal membrane. 
For a simple hypothetical system with only one perme- 
ant ion species, the Nernst equation allows the electrical 
potential across the membrane at equilibrium to be pre- 
dicted exactly. For example, if the concentration of K* on 
the inside is increased to 100 mM, the membrane potential 
will be -116 mV. More generally, if the membrane potential 
is plotted against the logarithm of the K* concentration gra- 
dient ({K*],,,/[K'],,), the Nernst equation predicts a linear 
relationship with a slope of 58 mV (actually 58/z) per tenfold 
change in the K* gradient (see Figure 2.5C). 
To reinforce and extend the concept of electrochemical 
equilibrium, consider some additional experiments on the 
influence of ionic species and ionic permeability that could 
be performed on the simple model system in Figure 2.5. 
What would happen to the electrical potential across the 
membrane (i.e., the potential of the inside relative to the 
ELECTRICAL SIGNALS OF NERVE CELLS 
33 
outside) if the potassium on the outside were replaced with 
10 mM sodium (Na*) and the K* in the inside compart- 
ment were replaced by 1 mM Na*? No potential would be 
generated because no Na* could flow across the membrane 
(which was defined as being permeable only to K*). How- 
ever, if under these ionic conditions (10 times more Na* 
outside) the K*-permeable membrane were to be magically 
replaced by a membrane permeable only to Na', a potential 
of +58 mV would be measured at equilibrium. If 10 mM 
calcium (Ca?*) were present outside and 1 mM Ca?* inside, 
and a Ca**-selective membrane separated the two sides, 
what would happen to the membrane potential? A poten- 
tial of +29 mV would develop—half that observed for Na*, 
because the valence of calcium is +2. Finally, what would 
happen to the membrane potential if 10 mM CI were pres- 
ent inside and 1 mM CI were present outside, with the two 
sides separated by a Cl--permeable membrane? Because 
the valence of this anion is —1, the potential would again 
be +58 mV. 
The balance of chemical and electrical forces at equi- 
librium means that the electrical potential can determine 
ion fluxes across the membrane, just as the ionic gradi- 
ent can determine the membrane potential. To examine 
the influence of membrane potential on ion flux, imagine 
connecting a battery across the two sides of the mem- 
brane to control the electrical potential across the mem- 
brane without changing the distribution of ions on the two 
sides (Figure 2.6). As long as the battery is off, things will 
be just as in Figure 2.4, with the flow of K* from inside to 
outside causing a negative membrane potential (Figure 
2.6A, left). However, if the battery is used to make the 
inside compartment initially more negative relative to the 
outside, there will be less K* flux, because the negative 
potential will tend to keep K* in the inside compartment. 
How negative will the inside need to be before there is no 
net flux of K*? The answer is -58 mV, the voltage needed 
to counter the tenfold difference in K* concentrations on 
the two sides of the membrane (Figure 2.6A, center). If 
the inside is initially made more negative than -58 mV, 
then K* will actually flow from the outside (compartment 
2, on the right) into the inside (compartment 1, on the 
left) because the positive ions will be attracted to the more 
negative potential of the inside (Figure 2.6A, right). This 
example demonstrates that both the direction and magni- 
tude of ion flux depend on the membrane potential. Thus, 
in some circumstances the electrical potential can over- 
come an ionic concentration gradient. 
The ability to alter ion flux experimentally by chang- 
ing either the potential imposed on the membrane (Figure 
2.6B) or the transmembrane concentration gradient for an 
ion (see Figure 2.5C) provides convenient tools for study- 
ing ion fluxes across the plasma membranes of neurons, as 
will be evident in many of the experiments described in the 
chapters that follow.

Now consider a somewhat more complex situation in which 
Na* and K* are unequally distributed across the membrane, 
as in Figure 2.7A. What would happen if 10 mM K* and 1 
mM Na* were present inside, and 1 mM K* and 10 mM Na* 
were present outside? If the membrane were permeable 
only to K*, the membrane potential would be —58 mV; if 
the membrane were permeable only to Na', the potential 
would be +58 mV. But what would the potential be if the 
membrane were permeable to both K* and Na'? In this 
case, the potential would depend on the relative permeabil- 
ity of the membrane to K* and Na'*. If it were more perme- 
able to K*, the potential would approach —-58 mV, and if it 
were more permeable to Na', the potential would be closer 
to +58 mV. Because there is no permeability term in the 
Nernst equation, which considers only the simple case of a 
single permeant ion species, a more elaborate equation is 
needed, one that takes into account both the concentration 
gradients of the permeant ions and the relative permeability 
of the membrane to each permeant species.

Such an equation was developed by David Goldman in 
1943. For the case most relevant to neurons, in which K',

equation is written

out 
where V is the voltage across the membrane (again, the in- 
side compartment, relative to the reference outside compart- 
ment) and P indicates the permeability of the membrane to 
each ion of interest. The Goldman equation is thus an ex- 
tended version of the Nernst equation that takes into account 
the relative permeabilities of each of the ions involved. The 
relationship between the two equations becomes obvious 
in the situation where the membrane is permeable only to 
one ion, say, K*; in this case, the Goldman expression col- 
lapses back to the simpler Nernst equation. In this context, it 
is important to note that the valence factor (z) in the Nernst 
equation has been eliminated; this is why the concentrations 
of negatively charged chloride ions, Cl, have been inverted 
relative to the concentrations of the positively charged ions 
[remember that —log (A/B) = log (B/A)]. 
If the membrane in Figure 2.7A is permeable only to K* 
and Na', the terms involving Cl drop out because Pavisid: 
In this case, solution of the Goldman equation yields a po- 
tential of -58 mV when only K* is permeant, +58 mV when 
only Na*is permeant, and some intermediate value if both 
ions are permeant. For example, if K* and Na* were equally 
permeant, then the potential would be 0 mV. 
With respect to neural signaling, it is particularly perti- 
nent to ask what would happen if the membrane started

E,. During an action potential, the membrane becomes very permeable to Na* (red); thus the mem- 
brane potential becomes positive and approaches the equilibrium potential for Na', E,.. The rise in 
Na* permeability is transient, however, so that the membrane again becomes primarily permeable to 
K*, causing the potential to return to its negative resting value. Notice that at the equilibrium poten- 
tial for a given ion there is no net flux of that ion across the membrane.

out being permeable to K* and then temporarily switched 
to become most permeable to Na'. In this circumstance, 
the membrane potential would start out at a negative level, 
become positive while the Na* permeability remained high, 
and then fall back to a negative level as the Na* permeabil- 
ity decreased again. As it turns out, this last case essentially 
describes what goes on in a neuron during the generation 
of an action potential. In the resting state, P, of the neuro- 
nal plasma membrane is much higher than Pe since, as a 
result of the action of ion transporters, there is always more 
K+ inside the cell than outside (see Table 2.1), the resting 
potential is negative (Figure 2.7B). As the membrane po- 
tential is depolarized (by synaptic action, for example), P,,, 
increases. The transient increase in Na* permeability causes 
the membrane potential to become even more positive (red 
region in Figure 2.7B), because Na* rushes in (there is much 
more Na' outside a neuron than inside, again as a result 
of ion pumps). Because of this positive feedback loop, an 
action potential occurs. The rise in Na* permeability during 
the action potential is transient, however; as the membrane 
permeability to K* is restored, the membrane potential 
quickly returns to its resting level. 
Armed with an appreciation of these simple electro- 
chemical principles, it will be much easier to understand the 
following, more detailed account of how neurons generate 
resting and action potentials. 
The lonic Basis of the Resting 
Membrane Potential 
The action of ion transporters creates substantial transmem- 
brane gradients for most ions. Table 2.1 summarizes the ion 
concentrations measured directly in an exceptionally large 
nerve cell found in the nervous system of the squid (Box 
2B). Such measurements are the basis for stating that there 
is much more K* inside the neuron than out, and much 
more Na* outside than in. Similar concentration gradients 
occur in the neurons of most animals, including humans. 
However, because the ionic strength of mammalian blood 
is lower than that of sea-dwelling animals such as squid, 
in mammals the concentrations of each ion are several

CHAPTER 2 
BOX 2B The Remarkable Giant Nerve Cells of Squid 
Many of the initial insights into how 
_ ion concentration gradients and 
_ changes in membrane permeability 
| produce electrical signals came from 
_ experiments performed on the extraor- 
_ dinarily large nerve cells of the squid. 
_ The axons of these nerve cells can be 
- up to 1 mm in diameter—100 to 1000 
_ times larger than mammalian axons. 
_ Thus, squid axons are large enough 
_ to allow experiments that would be 
_ impossible on most other nerve cells. 
_ For example, it is not difficult to insert 
_ simple wire electrodes inside these 
_ giant axons and make reliable electrical 
_ measurements. The relative ease of this

nerve cells form synaptic contacts with 
other giant nerve cells, producing very 
large synapses that have been extraor- 
dinarily valuable in understanding the 
fundamental mechanisms of synaptic 
transmission (see Chapter 5). 
Giant neurons evidently evolved 
in squid because they enhanced the 
animal's survival. These neurons par- 
ticipate in a simple neural circuit that 
activates the contraction of the mantle 
muscle, producing a jet propulsion 
effect that allows the squid to move 
away from predators at a remarkably 
fast speed. As discussed in Chapter 3, 
larger axonal diameter allows faster 
conduction of action potentials. Thus, 
presumably these huge nerve cells help 
squid escape more successfully from 
their numerous enemies. 
Today—more than 70 years after 
their discovery by John Z. Young at 
University College London—the giant 
nerve cells of squid remain useful 
experimental systems for probing basic 
neuronal functions.

times lower. These transporter-dependent concentration 
gradients are, indirectly, the source of the resting neuronal 
membrane potential and the action potential. 
Once the ion concentration gradients across various neu- 
ronal membranes are known, the Nernst equation can be 
used to calculate the equilibrium potential for K+ and other 
major ions. Since the resting membrane potential of the 
squid neuron is approximately -65 mV, K* is the ion that is 
closest to being in electrochemical equilibrium when the cell 
is at rest. This fact implies that the resting membrane is more 
permeable to K* than to the other ions listed in Table 2.1, 
and that this permeability is the source of resting potentials. 
It is possible to test this guess, as Alan Hodgkin and 
Bernard Katz did in 1949, by asking what happens to the 
resting membrane potential if the concentration of K* out- 
side the neuron is altered. If the resting membrane were 
permeable only to K*, then the Goldman equation (or even 
the simpler Nernst equation) predicts that the membrane 
potential will vary in proportion to the logarithm of the 
K* concentration gradient across the membrane. Assum- 
ing that the internal K* concentration is unchanged during 
the experiment, a plot of membrane potential against the 
logarithm of the external K* concentration should yield a 
straight line with a slope of 58 mV per tenfold change in 
external K* concentration at room temperature (see Fig- 
ure 2.5C). (The slope becomes about 61 mV at mammalian 
body temperatures.) 
When Hodgkin and Katz carried out this experiment on 
a living squid neuron, they found that the resting mem- 
brane potential did indeed change when the external K* 
concentration was modified, becoming less negative as ex- 
ternal K* concentration was raised (Figure 2.8A). When the 
external K* concentration was raised high enough to equal 
the concentration of K* inside the neuron, thus making the 
K* equilibrium potential 0 mV, the resting membrane po- 
tential was also approximately 0 mV. In short, the resting 
membrane potential varied as predicted with the logarithm 
of the K* concentration, with a slope that approached 58 
mV per tenfold change in K* concentration (Figure 2.8B). 
The value obtained was not exactly 58 mV because other 
ions, such as Cl and Na', are also slightly permeable, and 
thus influence the resting potential to a small degree. The 
contribution of these other ions is particularly evident at 
low external K* levels, again as predicted by the Goldman 
equation. In general, however, manipulation of the external 
concentrations of these other ions has only a small effect 
(see Figure 2.9E), emphasizing that K* permeability is in- 
deed the primary source of the resting membrane potential. 
In summary, Hodgkin and Katz showed that the inside- 
negative resting potential arises because (1) the membrane 
of the resting neuron is more permeable to K* than to any 
of the other ions present, and (2) there is more K* inside 
the neuron than outside. The selective permeability to K* 
is caused by K*-permeable membrane channels that are

gradient is, as noted, produced by membrane transport- 
ers that selectively accumulate K* within neurons. Many 
subsequent studies have confirmed the general validity of 
these principles. 
The lonic Basis of Action Potentials 
What causes the membrane potential of a neuron to depolar- 
ize during an action potential? Although a general answer to 
this question has been given (i.e., increased permeability to 
Na'), it is well worth examining some of the experimental 
support for this concept. Given the data in Table 2.1, one 
can use the Nernst equation to calculate that the equilibrium 
potential for Na* (E,,) in neurons, and indeed in most cells, is 
positive. Thus, if the membrane were to become highly per- 
meable to Na*, the membrane potential would approach E,... 
Based on these considerations, Hodgkin and Katz hypoth- 
esized that the action potential arises because the neuronal 
membrane becomes temporarily permeable to Na'. 
Taking advantage of the same style of ion substitu- 
tion experiment they used to assess the resting potential,

Hodgkin and Katz tested the role of Na*in generating the 
action potential by asking what happens to the action po- 
tential when Na* is removed from the external medium. 
They found that lowering the external Na* concentration 
reduces both the rate of rise of the action potential and its 
peak amplitude (Figure 2.9A—C). Indeed, when they ex- 
amined this Na* dependence quantitatively, they found a 
more-or-less linear relationship between the amplitude of 
the action potential and the logarithm of the external Na* 
concentration (Figure 2.9D). The slope of this relationship 
approached a value of 58 mV per tenfold change in Na* 
concentration, as expected for a membrane selectively per- 
meable to Na'. In contrast, lowering Na* concentration had 
very little effect on the resting membrane potential (Figure 
2.9E). Thus, while the resting neuronal membrane is only 
slightly permeable to Na*, the membrane becomes extraor- 
dinarily permeable to Na* during the rising phase and 
the overshoot phase of an action potential. (See Box 2C 
for further explanation of action potential nomenclature.) 
This temporary increase in Na* permeability results from 
the opening of Na*-selective channels that are essentially 
closed in the resting state. Membrane pumps maintain a 
large electrochemical gradient for Na*, which is in much 
higher concentration outside the neuron than inside. When 
the Na* channels open, Na* flows into the neuron, causing 
the membrane potential to depolarize and approach E,. .

The length of time the membrane potential lingers near 
E.,, (about +58 mV) during the overshoot phase of an action 
potential is brief because the increased membrane perme- 
ability to Na* itself is short-lived. The membrane potential 
rapidly repolarizes to resting levels and is followed by a 
transient undershoot. As will be described in Chapter 3, 
these latter events in the action potential are due to an in- 
activation of the Na* permeability and an increase in the 
K* permeability of the membrane. During the undershoot, 
the membrane potential is transiently hyperpolarized be- 
cause K* permeability becomes even greater than it is at 
rest. The action potential ends when this phase of enhanced 
K* permeability subsides, and the membrane potential thus 
returns to its normal resting level. 
The ion substitution experiments carried out by Hodgkin 
and Katz provided convincing evidence (1) that the resting 
membrane potential results from a high resting membrane 
permeability to K*, and (2) that depolarization during an 
action potential results from a transient rise in membrane 
Na* permeability. Although these experiments identified 
the ions that flow during an action potential, they did not 
establish how the neuronal membrane is able to change its 
ionic permeability to generate the action potential, or what 
mechanisms trigger this critical change. The next chapter 
addresses these issues, documenting the surprising con- 
clusion that the neuronal membrane potential itself affects 
. 
membrane permeability. 

The action potential of the squid giant 
_ axon has a characteristic shape, or 
waveform, with a number of different 
phases (Figure A). During the rising 
phase, the membrane potential rapidly 
depolarizes. In fact, action potentials 
cause the membrane potential to depo- 
larize so much that the membrane 
potential transiently becomes positive 
with respect to the external medium, 
producing an overshoot. The overshoot 
of the action potential gives way to 
a falling phase, in which the mem- 
brane potential rapidly repolarizes. 
Repolarization takes the membrane 
potential to levels even more negative 
than the resting membrane potential for 
a short time; this brief period of hyper- 
polarization is called the undershoot. 
Although the waveform of the squid 
action potential is typical, the details of 
the action potential form vary widely 
from neuron to neuron in different ani- 
mals. In myelinated axons of vertebrate 
motor neurons (Figure B), the action 
potential is virtually indistinguishable 
from that of the squid axon. However, 
the action potential recorded in the 
cell body of this same motor neuron 
(Figure C) looks rather different. Thus, 
the action potential waveform can vary 
even within the same neuron. More

complex action potentials are seen in 
other central neurons. For example, 
action potentials recorded from the cell 
bodies of neurons in the mammalian 
inferior olive (a region of the brainstem 
involved in motor control) last tens of 
milliseconds (Figure D). These action 
potentials exhibit a pronounced plateau 
during their falling phase, and their 
undershoot lasts even longer than that 
of the motor neuron. One of the most 
dramatic types of action potentials 
occurs in the cell bodies of cerebel- 
lar Purkinje neurons (Figure E). These 
potentials have several complex phases 
that result from the summation of mul- 
tiple, discrete action potentials. 
The variety of action potential 
waveforms could mean that each 
type of neuron has a different mecha- 
nism of action potential production. 
Fortunately, however, these diverse 
waveforms all result from relatively 
minor variations in the scheme used by 
the squid giant axon. For example, pla- 
teaus in the repolarization phase result 
from the presence of ion channels that 
are permeable to Ca'*, and long-lasting 
undershoots result from the presence 
of additional types of membrane K* 
channels. The complex action potential 
of the Purkinje cell results from these 
extra features plus the fact that different 
types of action potentials are gener- 
; 
ated in various parts of the Purkinje 
neuron—cell body, dendrites, and 
axons—and are summed together in 
recordings from the cell body. Thus, the 
lessons learned from the squid axon are 
applicable to, and indeed essential for, 
understanding action potential genera- 
tion in all neurons.

CHAPTER 2 
Summary 
Nerve cells generate electrical signals to convey information 
over substantial distances and to transmit it to other cells 
by means of synaptic connections. These signals ultimately 
depend on changes in the resting electrical potential across 
the neuronal membrane. A resting potential occurs be- 
cause nerve cell membranes are permeable to one or more 
ion species subject to an electrochemical gradient. More 
specifically, a negative membrane potential at rest results 
from a net efflux of K* across neuronal membranes that 
are predominantly permeable to K*. In contrast, an action 
potential occurs when a transient rise in Na* permeability 
allows a net flow of Na* in the opposite direction across the 
membrane, which is now predominantly permeable to Na'*. 
The brief rise in membrane Na* permeability is followed by 
a secondary, transient rise in membrane K* permeability 
that repolarizes the neuronal membrane and produces a 
brief undershoot of the action potential. As a result of these 
processes, the membrane is depolarized in an all-or-none 
fashion during an action potential. When these active per- 
meability changes subside, the membrane potential returns 
to its resting level because of the high resting membrane 
permeability to K*.

VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT 
MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY 
Overview 
THE ACTION POTENTIAL IS THE PRIMARY electrical signal generated by nerve 
cells and arises from changes in membrane permeability to specific ions. Present un- 
derstanding of these changes in ionic permeability is based on evidence obtained by 
the voltage clamp technique, which permits detailed characterization of permeability 
changes as a function of membrane potential and time. For most types of axons, these 
changes consist of a rapid and transient rise in sodium (Na*) permeability, followed 
by a slower but more prolonged rise in potassium (K*) permeability. Both permeabili- 
ties are voltage-dependent, increasing as the membrane potential depolarizes. The 
kinetics and voltage dependence of Na* and K* permeabilities provide a complete 
explanation of action potential generation. Depolarizing the membrane potential to 
the threshold level causes a rapid, self-sustaining increase in Na* permeability that 
produces the rising phase of the action potential; however, the Na* permeability 
increase is short-lived and is followed by a slower increase in K* permeability that 
restores the membrane potential to its usual negative resting level. A mathematical 
model that describes the behavior of these ionic permeabilities predicts virtually all 
of the observed properties of action potentials. Importantly, this same ionic mecha- 
nism permits action potentials to be propagated along the length of neuronal axons, 
explaining how electrical signals are conveyed throughout the nervous system. 
lonic Currents across Nerve Cell Membranes 
The previous chapter introduced the idea that nerve cells generate electrical signals 
by virtue of a membrane that is differentially permeable to various ion species. In 
particular, a transient increase in the permeability of the neuronal membrane to Na* 
initiates the action potential. This chapter considers exactly how this increase in Na* 
permeability occurs. A key to understanding this phenomenon is the observation that 
action potentials are initiated only when the neuronal membrane potential becomes 
more positive than a threshold level. This observation suggests that the mechanism 
responsible for the increase in Na* permeability is sensitive to the membrane po- 
tential. Therefore, if one could understand how a change in membrane potential 

42 
CHAPTER 3 
activates Na* permeability, it should be possible to explain 
how action potentials are generated. 
The fact that the Na* permeability that generates the 
membrane potential change is itself sensitive to the mem- 
brane potential presents both conceptual and practical ob- 
stacles to studying the mechanisms underlying the action 
potential. A practical problem is the difficulty of systemati- 
cally varying the membrane potential to study the permea- 
bility change, because such changes in membrane potential 
will produce an action potential, which causes further, un- 
controlled changes in the membrane potential. Historically, 
then, it was not really possible to understand action poten- 
tials until a technique was developed that allowed experi- 
menters to control membrane potential and simultaneously 
measure the underlying permeability changes. This tech- 
nique, the voltage clamp method (Box 3A), provides the 
information needed to define the ionic permeability of the 
membrane at any level of membrane potential. 
In the late 1940s, Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley, 
working at the University of Cambridge, used the voltage 
clamp technique to work out the permeability changes un- 
derlying the action potential. They again chose to use the

(3). This electronic feedback circuit 
holds the membrane potential at the 
desired level, even in the face of perme- 
ability changes that would normally 
alter the membrane potential (such 
as those generated during the action 
potential). Most importantly, the device 
permits the simultaneous measurement 
of the current needed to keep the cell 
at a given voltage (4). This current is 
exactly equal to the amount of current 
flowing across the neuronal membrane, 
allowing direct measurement of these 
membrane currents. Therefore, the volt- 
age clamp technique can indicate how 
membrane potential influences ionic 
current flow across the membrane. This

potential to the desired

3 When V,n is different from the 
command potential, the clamp 
amplifier injects current into the axon 
through a second electrode. This 
information gave Hodgkin and Huxley 
the key insights that led to their model 
for action potential generation. 
Today, the voltage clamp method 
remains widely used to study ionic cur- 
rents in neurons and other cells. The 
most popular contemporary version of 
this approach is the patch clamp tech- 
nique, a method that can be applied to 
virtually any cell and has a resolution 
high enough to measure the minute 
electrical currents flowing through 
single ion channels (see Box 4A).

giant neuron of the squid because its large size (up to 1 mm 
in diameter; see Box 2B ) allowed insertion of the electrodes 
necessary for voltage clamping. They were the first investi- 
gators to test directly the hypothesis that potential-sensitive 
Na* and K* permeability changes are both necessary and 
sufficient for the production of action potentials. 
Hodgkin and Huxley's first goal was to determine 
whether neuronal membranes do, in fact, have voltage- 
dependent permeabilities. To address this issue, they asked 
whether ionic currents flow across the membrane when its 
potential is changed. The result of one such experiment is 
shown in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1A illustrates the currents pro- 
duced by a squid axon when its membrane potential, V., is 
hyperpolarized from the resting level (65 mV) to -130 mV. 
The initial response of the axon results from the redistribu- 
tion of charge across the axonal membrane. This capacitive 
current is nearly instantaneous, ending within a fraction of 
a millisecond. Aside from this brief event, very little cur- 
rent flows when the membrane is hyperpolarized. How- 
ever, when the membrane potential is depolarized from -65 
mV to 0 mV, the response is quite different (Figure 3.1B). 
Following the capacitive current, the axon produces a rap- 
idly rising inward ionic current (inward refers to a positive 
charge entering the cell—that is, cations in or anions out), 
which gives way to a more slowly rising, delayed outward 
current. The fact that membrane depolarization elicits these 
ionic currents establishes that the membrane permeability 
of axons is indeed voltage-dependent. 
Two Types of Voltage-Dependent 
lonic Currents 
The results shown in Figure 3.1 demonstrate that the ionic 
permeability of neuronal membranes is voltage-sensitive, 
but the experiments do not identify how many types of per- 
meability exist, or which ions are involved. As discussed 
in Chapter 2 (see Figure 2.6), varying the potential across

Current flow across a squid axon membrane

capacitive current. (B) A 65 mV depolarization of the membrane

and a delayed but sustained outward current. (After Hodgkin et 
al., 1952.) 
a membrane makes it possible to deduce the equilibrium 
potential for the ionic fluxes through the membrane, and 
thus to identify the ions that are flowing. Because the volt- 
age clamp method allows the membrane potential to be 
changed while ionic currents are being measured, it was a 
straightforward matter for Hodgkin and Huxley to deter- 
mine ionic permeability by examining how the properties 
of the initial inward and later outward currents changed as 
the membrane potential was varied (Figure 3.2). As already 
noted, no appreciable ionic currents flow at membrane po- 
tentials more negative than the resting potential. At more 
positive potentials, however, the currents not only flow but 
change in magnitude. The early current has a U-shaped 
dependence on membrane potential, increasing over a 
range of depolarizations up to approximately 0 mV but de- 
creasing as the potential is depolarized further. In contrast, 
the late current increases monotonically with increasingly 
positive membrane potentials. These different responses to 
membrane potential can be seen more clearly when the 
magnitudes of the two current components are plotted as 
a function of membrane potential, as in Figure 3.3. 
The voltage sensitivity of the early current gives an im- 
portant clue about the nature of the ions carrying the cur- 
rent—namely, that no current flows when the membrane 
potential is clamped at +52 mV. For the squid neurons 
studied by Hodgkin and Huxley, the external Na* concen- 
tration is 440 mM, and the internal Na* concentration is 
50 mM. For this concentration gradient, the Nernst equa- 
tion predicts that the equilibrium potential for Na* should

be +55 mV. Recall further from Chapter 2 that at the Na* 
equilibrium potential there is no net flux of Na* across the 
membrane, even if the membrane is highly permeable to 
Na*. Thus, the experimental observation that no early cur- 
rent flows at the membrane potential where Na* cannot 
flow is a strong indication that the current is carried by entry 
of Na*into the axon. 
An even more demanding way to test whether Na* car- 
ries the early current is to examine the behavior of this cur- 
rent after removing external Na*. Removing Na* outside the

axon makes E,,, negative; if the permeability to Na*is in- 
creased under these conditions, current should flow out- 
ward as Na' leaves the neuron, due to the reversed elec- 
- trochemical gradient. Hodgkin and Huxley performed this 
experiment, and found that removing external Na* caused 
the early current to reverse its polarity and become an out- 
ward current at a membrane potential that gave rise to an 
inward current when external Na* was present (Figure 3.4). 
This result demonstrates convincingly that the early inward 
current measured when Na' is present in the external me- 
dium must be due to Na* entering the neuron. 
In the experiment shown in Figure 3.4, removal of exter- 
nal Na* has little effect on the outward current that flows 
after the neuron has been kept at a depolarized membrane 
voltage for several milliseconds. This further result shows 
that the late, outward current must be due to the flow of an 
ion other than Na'. Several lines of evidence presented by 
Hodgkin, Huxley, and others showed that this outward cur- 
rent is caused by K* exiting the neuron. Perhaps the most 
compelling demonstration of K* involvement is that the 
amount of K* efflux from the neuron (measured by loading 
the neuron with radioactive K*) is closely correlated with 
the magnitude of the late outward current. 
Taken together, these experiments show that changing 
the membrane potential to a level more positive than the 
resting potential produces two effects: an early influx of 
Na* into the neuron, followed by a delayed efflux of K*. 
The early influx of Na* produces a transient inward cur- 
rent, whereas the delayed efflux of K* produces a sustained 
outward current. The differences in the time course and 
FIGURE 3.3 
Relationship between current amplitude and membrane potential. 
Experiments such as the one shown in Figure 3.2, indicate that the late, outward current 
increases steeply with increasing depolarization, whereas the early, inward current first 
increases in magnitude but then decreases and reverses to outward current at about 
+55 mV (the sodium equilibrium potential). (After Hodgkin et al., 1952.)

ionic selectivity of the two fluxes suggest that 
two different ionic permeability mechanisms 
are activated by changes in membrane po- 
tential. Confirmation that there are indeed 
two distinct mechanisms has come from 
pharmacological studies of drugs that spe- 
cifically affect these two currents (Figure 3.5). 
Tetrodotoxin, an alkaloid neurotoxin found in 
certain puffer fish, tropical frogs, and sala- 
manders, blocks the Na* current without af- 
fecting the K* current. Conversely, tetraeth- 
ylammonium ions block K* currents without 
affecting Na* currents. The differential sen- 
sitivity of Na* and K* currents to these drugs 
provides strong additional evidence that Na* 
and K+ flow through independent perme- 
ability pathways. As discussed in Chapter 4, 
it is now known that these pathways are ion 
channels that are selectively permeable to ei- 
ther Na' or K*. In fact, tetrodotoxin, tetraeth- 
ylammonium, and other drugs that interact 
with specific types of ion channels have been

proteins (see Chapter 4). 
Two Voltage-Dependent Membrane 
Conductances 
The next goal Hodgkin and Huxley set for themselves was 
to describe Na* and K* permeability changes mathemati- 
cally. To do this, they assumed that the ionic currents are 
due to a change in membrane conductance, defined as 
the reciprocal of the membrane resistance. Membrane 
conductance is thus closely related, although not identical, 
to membrane permeability. When evaluating ionic move- 
ments from an electrical standpoint, it is convenient to 
describe them in terms of ionic conductances rather than 
ionic permeabilities. For present purposes, permeability and 
conductance can be considered synonymous. If membrane 
conductance (g) obeys Ohm's Law (which states that volt- 
age is equal to the product of current and resistance), then 
the ionic current that flows during an increase in membrane 
conductance is given by

CHAPTER 3 
where I, is the ionic current, V,, is the membrane poten- 
tial, and 'E,, is the equilibrium potential for the ion flowing 
through the conductance, 8... Lhe difference between V,, 
and E,. is the electrochemical driving force acting on the ion. 
Hodgkin and Huxley used this simple relationship to cal- 
culate the dependence of Na* and K* conductances on time 
and membrane potential. They knew V_, which was set by 
their voltage clamp device (Figure 3.6A), and they could 
determine E., and E,, from the ionic concentrations on the 
two sides of the axonal membrane (see Table 2.1). The cur- 
rents carried by Na* and K*—that is, I,, and I,—could be 
determined separately from recordings of the membrane 
currents resulting from depolarization (Figure 3.6B) by 
measuring the difference between currents recorded in the 
presence and absence of external Na* (as shown in Figure 
3.4). From these measurements, Hodgkin and Huxley were 
able to calculate g. and g, (Figure 3.6C,D), from which they 
drew two fundamental conclusions. The first conclusion is 
that the Na* and K* conductances change over time. For 
example, both Na* and K* conductances require some time 
to activate, or turn on. In particular, the K* conductance 
has a pronounced delay, requiring several milliseconds to 
reach its maximum (Figure 3.6D), whereas the Na* con- 
ductance reaches its maximum more rapidly (Figure 3.6C). 
The more rapid activation of the Na* conductance allows 
the resulting inward Na* current to precede the delayed 
outward K* current (Figure 3.6B). Although the Na* con- 
ductance rises rapidly, it quickly declines, even though the 
membrane potential is kept at a depolarized level. This fact 
shows that depolarization not only causes the Na* conduc- 
tance to activate, but also causes it to decrease over time, 
or inactivate. The K* conductance of the squid axon does 
FIGURE 3.6 Membrane conductance changes underlying 
the action potential are time- and voltage-dependent. 
Depolarizations to various membrane potentials (A) elicit differ- 
ent membrane currents (B). Shown below are the conductances 
of Na* (C) and K* (D) calculated from these currents. Both peak 
Na* conductance and steady-state K* conductance increase as 
the membrane potential becomes more positive. In addition, 
the activation of both conductances, as well as the rate of inac- 
tivation of the Na* conductance, occur more rapidly with larger 
depolarizations. (After Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952b.)

not inactivate in this way; thus, while the Na* and K* con- 
ductances share the property of time-dependent activa- 
tion, only the Na* conductance inactivates. (Inactivating K* 
conductances have since been discovered in other types of 
nerve cells; see Chapter 4.) The time courses of the Na* and 
K* conductances are voltage-dependent, with the speed of 
both activation and inactivation increasing at more depolar- 
ized potentials. This finding accounts for more rapid time 
courses of membrane currents measured at more depolar- 
ized potentials. 
The second conclusion derived from Hodgkin and Hux- 
ley's calculations is that both the Na* and K* conductances 
are voltage-dependent—that is, both conductances in- 
crease progressively as the neuron is depolarized. Figure 
3.7 illustrates this by plotting the relationship between peak 
value of the conductances (from Figure 3.6C,D) against the 
membrane potential. Note the similar voltage dependence 
for each conductance; both conductances are quite small at 
negative potentials, maximal at very positive potentials, and 
exquisitely dependent on membrane voltage at interme- 
diate potentials. The observation that these conductances 
are sensitive to changes in membrane potential shows that 
the mechanism underlying the conductances somehow 
"senses" the voltage across the membrane. 
All told, the voltage clamp experiments carried out by 
Hodgkin and Huxley showed that the ionic currents that 
flow when the neuronal membrane is depolarized are due 
to three different voltage-sensitive processes: (1) activation 
of Na* conductance, (2) activation of K* conductance, and 
(3) inactivation of Na* conductance. 
Reconstruction of the Action 
Potential 
From their experimental measurements, Hodgkin and Hux- 
ley were able to construct a detailed mathematical model 
of the Nat and K* conductance changes. The goal of these 
modeling efforts was to determine whether the Na* and K* 
conductances alone are sufficient to produce an action po- 
tential. Using this information, they could in fact generate the 
form and time course of the action potential with remarkable 
kt

accuracy (Figure 3.8A). The Hodgkin—Huxley model could 
simulate many other features of action potential behavior in 
the squid axon. For example, it was well known that, fol- 
lowing an action potential, the axon becomes refractory to 
further excitation for a brief period of time, termed the refrac- 
tory period (Figure 3.8B). The model was capable of closely 
mimicking such behavior (Figure 3.8C). 
The Hodgkin—Huxley model also provided many in- 
sights into how action potentials are generated. Figure 
3.8A shows a reconstructed action potential, together with 
the time courses of the underlying Na* and K* conduc- 
tances. The coincidence of the initial increase in Na* con- 
ductance with the rapid rising phase of the action potential 
demonstrates that a selective increase in Na* conductance 
is responsible for action potential initiation. The increase in 
Na* conductance causes Na* to enter the neuron, thus de- 
polarizing the membrane potential, which approaches E,... 
The rate of depolarization subsequently falls both because 
the electrochemical driving force on Na* decreases and be- 
cause the Na* conductance inactivates. At the same time, 
depolarization slowly activates the voltage-dependent K* 
conductance, causing K* to leave the cell and repolariz- 
ing the membrane potential toward E,. Because the K* 
conductance becomes temporarily higher than it is in the 
resting condition, the membrane potential briefly becomes 
more negative than the normal resting potential, to yield 
the undershoot. The hyperpolarization of the membrane 
potential causes the voltage-dependent K* conductance 
(and any Na* conductance not inactivated) to turn off, 
allowing the membrane potential to return to its resting 
level. The relatively slow time course of turning off the K* 
conductance, as well as the persistence of Na* conductance 
inactivation, is responsible for the refractory period (see 
also Figure 3.10). 
This mechanism of action potential generation rep- 
resents a positive feedback loop: Activating the voltage- 
dependent Na* conductance increases Na* entry into the 
neuron, which makes the membrane potential depolarize, 
which leads to the activation of still more Na* conduc- 
tance, more Na* entry, and still further depolarization (Fig- 
ure 3.9). Positive feedback continues unabated until Na*

this positive feedback loop, once initiated, is sustained by 
the intrinsic properties of the neuron—namely, the voltage

quality explains why action potentials exhibit all-or-none 
behavior (see Figure 2.1) and why they have a threshold 
(Box 3B). The delayed activation of the K+ conductance rep- 
resents a negative feedback loop that eventually restores 
the membrane to its resting state.

of the action potential down the axon. 
Why the action potential "takes 
off" at a particular level of depolariza- 
tion can be understood by comparing 
the underlying events to a chemical 
explosion (Figure A). Exogenous heat 
(analogous to the initial depolarization 
of the membrane potential) stimulates 
an exothermic chemical reaction, which 
produces more heat, which further 
enhances the reaction (Figure B). As a 
result of this positive feedback loop, the 
rate of the reaction builds up exponen- 
tially—the definition of an explosion. 
In any such process, however, there is 
a threshold, that is, a point up to which 
heat can be supplied without result- 
ing in an explosion. The threshold for 
the chemical explosion diagrammed 
here is the point at which the amount 
of heat supplied exogenously is just 
equal to the amount of heat that can be 
dissipated by the circumstances of the 
reaction (such as escape of heat from 
the beaker). 
The threshold of action potential 
initiation is, in principle, similar (Figure 
C). There is a range of "subthreshold" 
depolarization, within which the rate of 
increased sodium entry is less than the 
rate of potassium exit (remember that 
the membrane at rest is highly perme- 
able to K*, which therefore flows out 
as the membrane is depolarized). The 
point at which Na* inflow just equals 
K* outflow represents an unstable equi- 
librium analogous to the ignition point 
of an explosive mixture. The behavior 
of the membrane at threshold reflects 
this instability: The membrane potential 
may linger at the threshold level for a 
variable period before either returning 
to the resting level or flaring up into a 
full-blown action potential. In theory 
at least, if there is a net internal gain 
of a single Na* ion, an action potential 
occurs; conversely, the net loss of a 
single K* ion leads to repolarization. A 
more precise definition of threshold, 
therefore, is that value of membrane 
potential, in depolarizing from the 
resting potential, at which the current 
carried by Na* entering the neuron is 
exactly equal to the K* current that is 
flowing out. Once the triggering event 
depolarizes the membrane beyond this 
point, the positive feedback loop of Na* 
entry on membrane potential closes 
and the action potential "fires." 
Because the Na* and K* conduc- 
tances change dynamically over time, 
the threshold potential for producing 
an action potential also varies as a 
consequence of the previous activity 
of the neuron. For example, follow- 
ing an action potential, the membrane 
becomes temporarily refractory to fur- 
ther excitation because the threshold 
for firing an action potential transiently 
rises. There is, therefore, no specific 
value of membrane potential that 
defines the threshold for a given nerve 
cell in all circumstances.

Action potential conduction requires both active and passive 
current flow. Depolarization opens Na* channels locally and produces an action 
potential at point A of the axon (time t= 1). The resulting inward current flows pas- 
sively along the axon, depolarizing the adjacent region (point B) of the axon. Ata later 
time (t = 2), the depolarization of the adjacent membrane has opened Na* channels 
at point B, resulting in the initiation of the action potential at this site and additional 
inward current that again spreads passively to an adjacent point (point C) farther 
along the axon. Ata 
still later time (t = 3), the action potential has propagated even 
farther. This cycle continues along the full length of the axon. Note that as the action 
potential spreads, the membrane potential repolarizes due to K+ channel Opening and 
Na* channel inactivation, leaving a "wake" of refractoriness behind the action poten- 
tial that prevents its backward propagation (panel 4). The final panel graphs the time 
course of membrane potential changes at the points indicated. 

Hodgkin and Huxley's reconstruction of the action po- 
tential and all its features shows that the properties of the 
voltage-sensitive Na* and K* conductances, together with 
the electrochemical driving forces created by ion transport- 
ers, are sufficient to explain action potentials. Their use of 
both empirical and theoretical methods brought an unprec- 
edented level of rigor to a long-standing problem, setting a 
standard of proof that is achieved only rarely in biological 
research.

The voltage-dependent mechanisms of action potential 
generation also explain the long-distance transmission of 
these electrical signals. Recall from Chapter 2 that neurons 
are relatively poor passive conductors of electricity, at least 
compared to a wire. Nonetheless, action potentials can tra- 
verse great distances along axons despite these poor passive 
properties. How does this occur? The mechanism of action 
potential propagation is easy to grasp once one understands 
how action potentials are generated and how current pas- 
sively flows along an axon. A depolarizing stimulus—a syn- 
aptic potential or a receptor potential in an intact neuron, or 
an injected current pulse in an experiment such as the one 
depicted in Figure 3.10—locally depolarizes the axon, thus 
opening the voltage-sensitive Na* channels in that region. 
The opening of Na* channels causes inward movement 
of Na*, and the resultant depolarization of the membrane 
potential generates an action potential at that site. Some 
of the local current generated by the action potential will 
then flow passively down the axon, in the same way that 
subthreshold currents spread along an axon (see Figure 
2.3). Note that this passive current flow does not require 
the movement of Na* along the axon but, instead, occurs 
by a shuttling of charge, somewhat similar to what happens 
when wires passively conduct electricity by transmission of 
electron charge. This passive current flow depolarizes the 
membrane potential in the adjacent region of the axon, thus 
opening the Na* channels in the neighboring membrane. 
The local depolarization triggers an action potential in this 
region, which then spreads again in a continuing cycle until 
the action potential reaches the end of the axon. Thus, ac- 
tion potential propagation requires the coordinated action 
of two forms of current flow: the passive flow of current as 
well as active currents flowing through voltage-dependent 
ion channels. The regenerative properties of Na* channel 
opening allow action potentials to propagate in an all-or- 
none fashion by acting as a booster at each point along 
the axon, thus ensuring the long-distance transmission of 
electrical signals. 
Recall that the axons are refractory following an action 
potential: generation of an action potential briefly makes it 
harder for the axon to produce subsequent action potentials 
VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY 
514 
(see Figure 3.8B). Refractoriness limits the number of action 
potentials that a neuron can produce per unit time, with dif- 
_ 
ferent types of neurons having different maximum rates of 
action potential firing due to different types and densities of 
ion channels. As described in a previous section, the refrac- 
tory period arises because the depolarization that produces 
Na* channel opening also causes delayed activation of K* 
channels and Na* channel inactivation, which temporar- 
ily makes it more difficult for the axon to produce another 
action potential. This refractoriness also has important im- 
plications for action potential conduction along axons. As 
the action potential sweeps along the length of an axon, 
in its wake the action potential leaves the Na* channels 
inactivated and K* channels activated for a brief time. The 
resulting refractoriness of the membrane region where an 
action potential has been generated prevents subsequent 
re-excitation of this membrane as action potentials are gen- 
erated in adjacent regions of the axon (see Figure 3.10). This 
important feature prevents action potentials from propagat- 
ing backward, toward their point of initiation, as they travel 
along an axon. Thus, refractory behavior ensures polarized 
propagation of action potentials from their usual point of 
initiation near the neuronal cell body, toward the synaptic 
terminals at the distal end of the axon. 
Increased Conduction Velocity as a 
Result of Myelination 
As a consequence of their mechanism of propagation, ac- 
tion potentials occur later and later at greater distances 
along the axon (Figure 3.10, bottom left). Thus, the action 
potential has a measurable rate of transmission, called the 
conduction velocity. Conduction velocity is an important 
parameter because it defines the time required for electrical 
information to travel from one end of a neuron to another 
and, thus, limits the flow of information within the nervous 
system. It is not surprising, then, that various mechanisms 
have evolved to optimize the propagation of action po- 
tentials along axons. Because action potential conduction 
requires passive and active flow of current, the rate of ac- 
tion potential propagation is determined by both of these 
phenomena. One way of improving passive current flow is 
to increase the diameter of an axon, which effectively de- 
creases the internal resistance to passive current flow. The 
consequent increase in action potential conduction velocity 
presumably explains why giant axons evolved in inverte- 
brates such as squid, and why rapidly conducting axons in 
all animals tend to be larger than slowly conducting ones. 
Another strategy to improve the passive flow of electri- 
cal current is to insulate the axonal membrane, reducing the 
ability of current to leak out of the axon and thus increasing 
the distance along the axon that a given local current can 
flow passively. This strategy is evident in the myelination 
of axons, a process by which oligodendrocytes in the central

However, the presence of myelin prevents the local current from leaking across the 
internodal membrane; it therefore flows farther along the axon than it would in the 
absence of myelin. Moreover, voltage-gated Na* channels are present only at the nodes 
of Ranvier (voltage-gated K* channels are present at the nodes of some neurons, but 
not others). This arrangement means that the generation of active, voltage-gated 
Na* 
currents need occur only at these unmyelinated regions. The result is greatly enhanced 
speed of action potential conduction. The final panel graphs the time course of mem- 
brane potential changes at the points indicated. (B from Chen et al., 2004.)

Myelin increases action potential conduction speed. The diagram 
compares the speed of action potential conduction in unmyelinated (upper panel in 
each pair) and myelinated (lower panels) axons. For clarity, passive conduction (arrows) is 
shown only for the direction of action potential propagation. 
For example, whereas unmyelinated axon 
conduction velocities range from about 
0.5 to 10 meters per second, myelinated 
axons can conduct at velocities of up to 
150 meters per second. The major reason 
underlying this marked increase in speed 
is that the time-consuming process of 
action potential generation occurs only 
at specific points along the axon, called 
nodes of Ranvier, where there is a gap 
in the myelin wrapping (see Figure 1.3G). 
If the entire surface of an axon were insu- 
lated, there would be no place for current 
to flow out of the axon, and action po- 
tentials could not be generated. Thus, the 
voltage-gated Na* channels required for 
action potentials are found only at these 
nodes of Ranvier (Figure 3.11B). An ac- 
tion potential generated at one node of 
Ranvier elicits current that flows passively 
within the myelinated segment until the 
next node is reached. This local current 
flow then generates an action potential in 
the neighboring segment, and the cycle 
is repeated along the length of the axon. 
Because current flows across the neuro- 
nal membrane only at the nodes (Figure 
3.11C), this type of propagation is called 
saltatory, meaning that the action po- 
tential jumps from node to node. Loss 
of myelin, as occurs in diseases such as 
multiple sclerosis, causes a variety of seri- 
ous neurological problems because of the 
resulting defects in axonal conduction of 
action potentials (Box 3C). 
Summary 
The action potential and all its complex 
properties can be explained by time- 
and voltage-dependent changes in the 
Na* and K* permeabilities of neuronal 
membranes. This conclusion derives 
primarily from evidence obtained by 
a device called the voltage clamp. The 
voltage clamp technique is an electronic 
feedback method that allows control of 
neuronal membrane potential and, si- 
multaneously, direct measurement of

CHAPTER 3 
_ Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of 
_ the central nervous system character- 
_ ized by a variety of clinical problems 
_ that arise from demyelination and 
_ inflammation along axonal pathways. 
_ The disorder commonly manifests 
_ between the ages 20 and 40 with an 
_ abrupt onset of neurological deficits 
_ that persist for days or weeks and then 
_ remit. The clinical course ranges from 
_ patients with no persistent neurologi- 
_ cal loss, some of whom experience only 
- occasional later symptoms, to others 
who progressively deteriorate as a result 
| of extensive and relentless central ner- 
vous system involvement. 
The signs and symptoms of MS 
are determined by the location of the 
_ affected regions. Particularly common 
_ 
are monocular blindness (due to lesions 
_ of the optic nerve), motor weakness 
_ 
or paralysis (due to lesions of the cor- 
ticospinal tracts), abnormal somatic 
sensations (due to lesions of somatic 
sensory pathways, often in the posterior 
columns), double vision (due to lesions 
_ of medial longitudinal fasciculus), and 
dizziness (due to lesions of vestibular 
pathways). Abnormalities are often 
apparent in the cerebrospinal fluid, 
which usually contains an abnormal 
number of cells associated with inflam- 
| mation and an increased content of 
antibodies (a sign of an altered immune 
response). Multiple sclerosis is a dif- 
ficult diagnosis, generally relying on 
the presence of a neurological problem 
that remits, only to return at an unre- 
lated site. Confirmation can sometimes 
be obtained from magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) or from functional evi- 
dence of lesions in a particular pathway 
by abnormal evoked potentials. The 
histological hallmark of MS at post 
mortem is multiple lesions at different 
sites showing loss of myelin associated 
with infiltration of inflammatory cells 
and, in some instances, loss of axons 
themselves. 
The concept of MS as a demyelinat- 
ing disease is deeply embedded in the 
clinical literature, although precisely 
how the demyelination translates into 
functional deficits is poorly understood. 
The loss of the myelin sheath surround- 
ing many axons clearly compromises 
action potential conduction, and the 
abnormal patterns of nerve conduction 
that result presumably produce most of 
the clinical deficits that characterize the 
disease. However, MS may have effects 
that extend beyond loss of the myelin 
sheath. It is clear that some axons are 
actually destroyed, probably as a result 
of inflammatory processes in the overly- 
ing myelin and/or loss of trophic sup- 
port of the axon by oligodendrocytes. 
Thus, axon loss contributes to functional 
deficits in MS, especially in the chronic, 
progressive forms of the disease. 
The ultimate cause of MS remains 
unclear. The immune system undoubt- 
edly contributes to the damage, and 
new immunoregulatory therapies 
provide substantial benefits to some 
patients. Precisely how the immune 
system is activated to cause the injury is 
not known. The most popular hypothe- 
sis is that MS is an autoimmune disease 
(i.e., the immune system attacks the 
body's proper constituents). The fact 
that immunization of experimental ani- 
mals with any one of several molecular 
constituents of the myelin sheath can 
induce a demyelinating disease (called 
experimental allergic encephalomyeli- 
tis) shows that an autoimmune attack 
on the myelin membrane is sufficient 
to produce a picture similar to MS. 
Very recent evidence suggests that one 
important target of autoimmune attack 
is contactin-2, a protein found on glia 
and axons at the node of Ranvier. A 
possible explanation of the human 
disease is that a genetically susceptible 
individual becomes transiently infected 
(by a minor viral illness, for example) 
with a microorganism that expresses 
a molecule structurally similar to con- 
tactin-2 or some other component of 
myelin. An immune response to this 
antigen is mounted to attack the invad- 
er, but the failure of the immune sys- 
tem to discriminate between the foreign 
protein and self results in destruction 
of otherwise normal myelin, a scenario 
occurring in mice infected with Theiler's 
virus. 
BOX 3C Multiple Sclerosis 
An alternative hypothesis is that MS 
is caused by a persistent infection by a 
virus or other microorganism. In this 
scenario, the immune system's ongoing 
efforts to get rid of the pathogen cause 
the damage to myelin. Tropical spastic 
paraparesis (TSP) provides a precedent 
for this idea. TSP is characterized by the 
eradual progression of weakness of the 
legs and impaired control of bladder 
function associated with increased deep 
tendon reflexes and a positive Babinski 
sign (see Figure 17.16). This clinical 
picture is similar to that of rapidly 
advancing MS, and TSP is known to 
be caused by persistent infection with 
a retrovirus (human T lymphotropic 
virus-1). Proving the persistent viral 
infection hypothesis for MS, however, 
requires unambiguous demonstra- 
tion of the presence of a virus. Despite 
periodic reports of a virus associated 
with MS, convincing evidence has not 
been forthcoming. In sum, despite the 
benefits to some patients of immuno- 
modulatory therapies, the diagnosis and 
treatment of multiple sclerosis remains 
a daunting clinical challenge.

Mathematical modeling of the properties of these conduc- 
tances indicates that they, and they alone, are responsible 
for the production of all-or-none action potentials in the 
squid axon. Action potentials propagate along the nerve 
cell axons, initiated by the voltage gradient between the 
active and inactive regions of the axon by virtue of the lo- 
cal current flow. In this way, action potentials compensate 
for the relatively poor passive electrical properties of nerve 
cells and enable neural signaling over long distances. These 
classical electrophysiological findings provide a solid ba- 
sis for considering the functional and ultimately molecular 
variations on neural signaling that will be taken up in the

ION CHANNELS 
Overview 
THE GENERATION OF ELECTRICAL SIGNALS in neurons requires that plasma 
membranes establish concentration gradients for specific ions and that these mem- 
branes undergo rapid and selective changes in their permeability to these ions. The 
membrane proteins that create and maintain ion gradients are called active transport- 
ers; other proteins, called ion channels, give rise to selective ion permeability changes. 
Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that contain a specialized structure, the pore, 
that permits particular ions to cross the neuronal membrane. Some ion channels also 
contain structures that are able to sense the electrical potential across the membrane. 
Such voltage-gated channels open or close in response to the magnitude of the mem- 
brane potential, allowing the membrane's permeability to be regulated by changes 
in this potential. Other types of ion channels are gated by chemical signals, either by 
extracellular signals such as neurotransmitters or by intracellular signals such as sec- 
ond messengers. Still others respond to mechanical stimuli, temperature changes, or 
a combination of such signals. Many types of ion channels have been characterized at 
both the gene and protein levels, resulting in the identification of a large number of 
channel subtypes that are differentially present in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. 
Having different types of ion channels in different cell types can generate a wide spec- 
trum of electrical characteristics. In contrast to ion channels, active transporters are 
membrane proteins that produce and maintain ion concentration gradients. The most 
important of these is the Na* pump, which hydrolyzes ATP to regulate the intracellular 
concentrations of both Na* and K*. Other active transporters produce concentration 
eradients for the full range of physiologically important ions, including Cl, Ca**, and 
H+. From the perspective of electrical signaling, active transporters and ion channels 
are complementary: transporters create the concentration gradients that help drive ion 
fluxes through open ion channels, thus generating electrical signals. 
lon Channels Underlying Action Potentials 
Although Hodgkin and Huxley had no knowledge of the physical nature of the con- 
ductance mechanisms underlying action potentials, they nonetheless proposed that 
nerve cell membranes have channels that allow ions to pass selectively from one side

ionic conductances and currents measured in voltage clamp 
experiments, the postulated channels had to have several 
properties. First, because the ionic currents are quite large, 
the channels had to be capable of allowing ions to move

across the membrane at high rates. Second, because the 
currents depend on the electrochemical gradient across the 
membrane, the channels had to make use of these gradi- 
ents. Third, because Na* and K* flow across the membrane 
independently of each other, different channel types had 
to be capable of discriminating between Na* and K*, al- 
lowing only one of these ions to flow across the membrane 
under the relevant conditions. Finally, given that the ionic 
conductances are voltage-dependent, the channels had to 
be able to sense the voltage drop across the membrane, 
opening only when the voltage reached appropriate levels. 
While this concept of channels was highly speculative in 
the 1950s, later experimental work established beyond any 
doubt that transmembrane proteins called voltage-sensitive 
ion channels indeed exist and are responsible for action po- 
tentials and all of the other electrical signals described in 
Chapters 2 and 3. 
The first direct evidence for the presence of voltage-sen- 
sitive, ion-selective channels in nerve cell membranes came 
from measurements of the ionic currents flowing through 
individual ion channels. The voltage-clamp apparatus used 
by Hodgkin and Huxley could only resolve the aggregate 
current resulting from the flow of ions through many thou- 
sands of channels. A technique capable of measuring the 
currents flowing through single channels was devised in 
1976 by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann at the Max Planck 
Institute in Germany. This remarkable approach, called 
patch clamping, revolutionized the study of membrane 
currents (Box 4A). In particular, the patch clamp method 
provided the means to test directly Hodgkin and Huxley's 
proposals about the characteristics of ion channels. 
Currents flowing through Na* channels are best exam- 
ined in experimental circumstances that prevent the flow of 
current through other types of channels that are present in 
the membrane (e.g., K* channels). Under such conditions, 
depolarizing a patch of membrane from a squid giant axon 
causes tiny inward currents to flow, but only occasionally 
(Figure 4.1). The size of these currents is minuscule—ap- 
proximately l-2 pA (i.e., 10" ampere)—but is stereotyped, 
reaching discrete values that suggest ion flux though 
FIGURE 4.1

to the axon to block voltage-gated K* channels. Depolarizing voltage pulses (A)

which the probability of channel openings diminishes because of channel inactiva- 
0.2 
tion. (D) A macroscopic current measured from another axon shows the close cor- 
relation between the time courses of microscopic and macroscopic Na* currents. (E) 
The probability of an Na* channel opening depends on the membrane potential, 
increasing as the membrane is depolarized. (B,C after Bezanilla and Correa, 1995; D - 
after Vandenburg and Bezanilla, 1991; E after Correa and Bezanilla, 1994.) 

_ A wealth of new information about ion 
_ channels has resulted from the inven- 
_ tion of the patch clamp method. This 
technique is based ona very simple 
idea. A glass pipette with a very small 
_ opening is used to make tight contact 
with a tiny area, or patch, of neuronal 
membrane. After the application of a 
small amount of suction to the back 
_ of the pipette, the seal between the 
pipette and membrane becomes so 
tight that no ions can flow between 
the pipette and the membrane. Thus, 
all the current that flows when a single 
ion channel opens must flow into the 
pipette. This minute electrical current 
can be measured with an ultrasensitive 
electronic amplifier connected to the 
pipette. This arrangement is the cell- 
attached patch clamp recording method. 
As with the conventional 
voltage clamp method, the 
patch clamp method allows 
experimental control of the 
membrane potential to char- 
acterize the voltage depen- 
dence of membrane currents. 
Minor manipulations 
allow other recording config- 
urations. For example, if the 
membrane patch within the 
pipette is disrupted by briefly 
applying strong suction, 
the interior of the pipette 
becomes continuous with the 
cell cytoplasm. This arrange- 
ment allows measurements 
of electrical potentials and 
currents from the entire 
cell and is therefore called 
whole-cell recording. The 
whole-cell configuration also 
allows diffusional exchange 
between the solution in the 
pipette and the cytoplasm, 
producing a convenient way 
to inject substances into the 
interior of a "patched" cell. 
Two other variants of the 
patch clamp method origi- 
nate from the finding that

the cell without disrupting the seal; 
this yields a preparation that is free of 
the complications imposed by the rest 
of the cell. Simply retracting a pipette 
that is in the cell-attached configura- 
tion causes a small vesicle of membrane 
to remain attached to the pipette. 
By exposing the tip of the pipette to 
air, the vesicle opens to yield a small 
patch of membrane with its (former) 
intracellular surface exposed. This 
arrangement, called the inside-out patch 
recording configuration, makes it possible 
to change the medium to which the 
intracellular surface of the membrane 
is exposed. Thus, the inside-out con- 
figuration is particularly valuable when 
studying the influence of intracellular 
molecules on ion channel function.

recording configuration, is optimal for 
studying how channel activity is influ- 
enced by extracellular chemical signals 
such as neurotransmitters (see Chapter 
5). This range of possible configura- 
tions makes the patch clamp method an 
unusually versatile technique for studies 
of ion channel function. Robotic ver- 
sions of the patch clamp technique are 
even making their way into industry, 
serving as a very sensitive and rapid 
means of screening therapeutic drugs 
that act upon ion channels.

of magnitude smaller than the Na* currents measured by

a much more extensive region of surface membrane. Al- 
though microscopic currents are certainly small, a current 
of 1 pA nonetheless reflects the flow of thousands of ions 
per millisecond. Thus, as predicted, a single channel can let 
many ions pass through the membrane in a very short time. 
Several observations further proved that the microscopic 
currents in Figure 4.1B are due to the opening of single, 
voltage-activated Na* channels. First, the currents are car- 
ried by Na'; thus, they are directed inward when the mem- 
brane potential is more negative than E,,, reverse their po- 
larity at E,, are outward at more positive potentials, and are 
reduced in size when the Na* concentration of the external 
medium is decreased. This behavior exactly parallels that of 
the macroscopic Na* currents described in Chapter 3. Sec- 
ond, the channels have a time course of opening, closing, 
and inactivating that matches the kinetics of macroscopic 
Na* currents. This correspondence is difficult to appreciate 
inthe measurement of microscopic currents flowing through 
a single open channel, because individual channels open and 
close in a stochastic (random) manner, as can be seen by 
examining the individual traces in Figure 4.1B. However, 
repeated depolarization of the membrane potential causes 
each Na* channel to open and close many times. When the 
current responses to a large number of such stimuli are aver- 
aged together, the collective response has a time course that 
looks much like the macroscopic Na* current (Figure 4.1C). 
In particular, the channels open mostly at the beginning of 
a prolonged depolarization, showing that they subsequently 
inactivate, as predicted from the macroscopic Na* current 
(compare Figures 4.1C and 4.1D). Third, both the opening 
and closing of the channels are voltage-dependent; thus, the 
channels are closed at -80 mV but open when the membrane 
potential is depolarized. In fact, the probability that any given 
channel will be open varies with membrane potential (Figure 
4.1E), again as predicted from the macroscopic Na* conduc- 
tance (see Figure 3.7). Finally, tetrodotoxin, which blocks 
the macroscopic Na* current (see Box 4B), also blocks mi- 
croscopic Na* currents. Taken together, these results show 
that the macroscopic Na* current measured by Hodgkin and 
Huxley does indeed arise from the aggregate effect of many 
thousands of microscopic Na* currents, each representing 
the opening of a single voltage-sensitive Na* channel.

Patch clamp experiments also revealed the properties of 
the channels responsible for the macroscopic K* currents 
associated with action potentials. When the membrane po- 
tential is depolarized (Figure 4.2A), microscopic outward 
currents (Figure 4.2B) can be observed under conditions 
that block Na* channels. The microscopic outward cur- 
rents exhibit all the features expected for currents flowing 
through action potential-related K* channels. Thus, the 
microscopic currents (Figure 4.2C), like their macroscopic 
counterparts (Figure 4.2D), fail to inactivate during brief de- 
polarizations. Moreover, these single-channel currents are 
sensitive to ionic manipulations and drugs that affect the 
macroscopic K* currents and, like the macroscopic K* cur- 
rents, are voltage-dependent (Figure 4.2E). This and other 
evidence shows that macroscopic K* currents associated 
with action potential repolarization arise from the opening 
of many voltage-sensitive K* channels. 
In summary, patch clamping has allowed direct observa- 
tion of microscopic ionic currents flowing through single 
ion channels, confirming that voltage-sensitive Na* and K* 
channels are responsible for the macroscopic conductances 
and currents that underlie the action potential. Measure- 
ments of the behavior of single ion channels has also pro- 
vided insight into the molecular attributes of these chan- 
nels. For example, single channel studies show that the

membrane of the squid axon contains at least two types of 
channels—one selectively permeable to Na* and a second. 
selectively permeable to K*. This ion selectivity means that 
these channels are able to discriminate between Na* and K*. 
Because their opening is influenced by membrane potential, 
both channel types are voltage-gated. For each channel, 
depolarization increases the probability of channel open- 
ing, whereas hyperpolarization closes them (see Figures 
4.1E and 4.2E). Thus, both channel types must have a volt- 
age sensor that detects the potential across the membrane 
(Figure 4.3). However, these channels differ in important 
respects. In addition to their different ion selectivities, depo- 
larization inactivates the Na* channel but not the K* chan- 
nel, causing Na* channels to pass into a non-conducting 
state. The Na* channel must therefore have an additional 
molecular mechanism responsible for inactivation. And, as 
expected from the macroscopic behavior of the Na* and K* 
currents described in Chapter 3, the kinetic properties of 
the gating of the two channels differ. Finally, these channel 
proteins provide unique binding sites for drugs and for vari- 
ous neurotoxins known to block specific subclasses of ion 
channels (Box 4B). This information about the physiology of 
single channels set the stage for subsequent studies of the 
molecular diversity of ion channels in various cell types, and 
of their detailed functional characteristics.

Nat channels also inactivate during prolonged 
depolarization, whereas many types of K* 
channels do not.

CHAPTER 4 
BOX 4B Toxins That Poison lon Channels 
_ Given the importance of Na* and K* 
' channels for neuronal excitation, it is . 
_ not surprising that channel-specific tox- 
_ ins have evolved in a number of organ- 
_ isms as mechanisms for self-defense or 
_ for capturing prey. A rich collection of 
_ natural toxins selectively target the ion 
_ channels of neurons and other cells. 
| These toxins are valuable not only for 
_ survival, but for studying the function of 
_ cellular ion channels. The best-known 
_ channel toxin is tetrodotoxin, produced 
by certain puffer fish and other animals. 
Tetrodotoxin produces a potent and 
specific obstruction of the Na* chan- 
_ nels responsible for action potential 
generation, thereby paralyzing the 
animals unfortunate enough to ingest 
it. Saxitoxin, a chemical homologue of 
tetrodotoxin produced by dinoflagel- 
lates, has a similar action on Na* chan- 
nels. The potentially lethal effects of 
eating shellfish that have ingested these 
"red tide" dinoflagellates are due to the 
potent neuronal actions of saxitoxin. 
Scorpions paralyze their prey by 
injecting a potent mix of peptide toxins 
that also affect ion channels. Among 
these are the a-toxins, which slow the

inactivation of Na* channels (Figure 
A1); exposure of neurons to a-toxins 
prolongs the action potential (Figure 
A2), thereby scrambling information 
flow within the nervous system of the 
soon-to-be-devoured victim. Other 
peptides in scorpion venom, called 
B-toxins, shift the voltage dependence 
of Na* channel activation (Figure B). 
These toxins cause Na' channels to 
open at potentials much more negative 
than normal, inducing uncontrolled 
action potential firing. Some alkaloid 
toxins combine these actions, both 
removing inactivation and shifting acti- 
vation of Na* channels. One such toxin 
is batrachotoxin, produced by a species 
of frog (some tribes of South American 
Indians use this poison on their arrow 
tips). A number of plants produce 
similar toxins, including aconitine, from 
buttercups; veratridine, from lilies; and 
a number of insecticidal toxins (pyre- 
thrins) produced by plants such as 
chrysanthemums and rhododendrons. 
Potassium channels have also been 
targeted by toxin-producing organ- 
isms. Peptide toxins affecting K* chan- 
nels include dendrotoxin, from wasps;

discovery.

The Diversity of lon Channels 
Molecular genetic studies, in conjunction with the patch 
clamp method and other techniques, have led to many 
advances in understanding ion channels. Genes encoding 
Na* and K* channels, as well as many other channel types, 
have been identified and cloned. A surprising fact that has 
emerged from these molecular studies is the number and 
ION CHANNELS AND TRANSPORTERS 
63 
diversity of genes that code for ion channels. Well over 100 
ion channel genes have been discovered—a number that 
could not have been anticipated from early studies of ion 
channel function. To understand the functional significance 
of this multitude of ion channel genes, the channels can 
be selectively expressed in well-defined experimental sys- 
tems, such as cultured cells or frog oocytes (Box 4C), and 
then studied with patch clamping and other physiological 
BOX 4C Expression of lon Channels in Xenopus Oocytes 
Bridging the gap between the DNA 
sequence of an ion channel gene and 
understanding channel function is a 
challenge. To meet this challenge, it 
_ 
is essential to have an experimental 
system in which the gene product can 
be expressed efficiently, and in which 
the function of the resulting channel 
can be studied with methods such as 
the patch clamp technique. Ideally, the 
vehicle for expression should be readily 
available, have few endogenous chan- 
nels, and be large enough to permit 
mRNA and DNA to be microinjected 
with ease. Oocytes (immature eggs) 
from the clawed African frog, Xenopus 
laevis (Figure A), fulfill all these 
demands. These huge cells (approxi- 
mately 1 mm in diameter; Figure B) 
are easily harvested from the female 
Xenopus. Work performed in the 1970s 
by John Gurdon, a developmental 
biologist, showed that injection of 
exogenous mRNA into frog oocytes 
causes them to synthesize foreign 
protein in prodigious quantities. In 
the early 1980s, Ricardo Miledi, Eric 
Barnard, and other neurobiologists 
demonstrated that Xenopus oocytes 
could express exogenous ion channels, 
and that physiological methods could 
be used to study the ionic currents 
generated by the newly-synthesized 
channels (Figure C). 
As a result of these pioneering stud- 
ies, heterologous expression experi- 
ments have now become a standard 
way of studying ion channels. The 
approach has been especially valu- 
able in deciphering the relationship 
between channel structure and func- 
tion. In such experiments, defined 
mutations (often affecting a single 
nucleotide) are made in the part of the 
channel gene that encodes a structure 
(A) 
of interest; the resulting channel pro- 
teins are then expressed in oocytes to 
assess the functional consequences of 
the mutation. 
The ability to combine molecular 
and physiological methods in a single 
cell system has made Xenopus oocytes 
a powerful experimental tool. Indeed, 
this system has been as valuable to 
contemporary studies of voltage-gated 
ion channels as the squid axon was to 
such studies in the 1950s and 1960s.

techniques. Channel genes can also be deleted from ge- 
netically tractable organisms, such as mice or fruit flies, to 
determine the roles these channels play in the intact organ- 
ism. Such studies have found many voltage-gated chan- 
nels that respond to membrane potential in much the same 
way as do the Na* and K* channels that underlie the action 
potential. Other channels, however, are gated by chemical 
signals that bind to extracellular or intracellular domains 
on these proteins and are insensitive to membrane voltage. 
Still others are sensitive to mechanical displacement, or to 
changes in temperature. 
Further magnifying the diversity of ion channels are a 
number of mechanisms that can produce functionally dif- 
ferent types of ion channels from a single gene. Ion chan- 
nel genes contain a large number of coding regions that 
can be spliced together in different ways, giving rise to 
channel proteins that can have dramatically different func- 
tional properties. RNAs encoding ion channels also can be 
edited, modifying their base composition after transcrip- 
tion from the gene. For example, editing the RNA encod- 
ing of some receptors for the neurotransmitter glutamate 
(Chapter 6) changes a single amino acid within the recep- 
tor, which in turn gives rise to channels that differ in their 
selectivity for cations and in their conductance. Channel 
proteins can also undergo posttranslational modifications, 
such as phosphorylation by protein kinases (see Chapter 
7), which can further regulate their functional character- 
istics. In addition, channels are often made up of subunits 
encoded by different genes, with different combinations 
of subunits producing channels of different function. Thus, 
although the basic electrical signals of the nervous sys- 
tem are relatively stereotyped, the proteins responsible for 
generating these signals are remarkably diverse, confer- 
ring specialized signaling properties to many of the neu- 
ronal cell types that populate the nervous system. These 
channels also are involved in a broad range of neurological 
diseases (see Box 4D).

Voltage-Gated lon Channels 
Voltage-gated ion channels that are selectively perme- 
able to each of the major physiological ions—Na*, K*, Ca', 
and Cl-—have been described (Figure 4.4A—D). Indeed, 
many different genes have been discovered for each type 
of voltage-gated channel; an example is the identification of 
10 human Na* channel genes. This finding was unexpected 
because Na* channels from many different cell types have 
similar functional properties, consistent with their origin 
from a single gene. It is now clear, however, that all of these 
Na* channel genes (called SCN genes) produce proteins 
that differ in their structure, function, and distribution in 
specific tissues. For instance, in addition to the rapidly in- 
activating Na* channels discovered by Hodgkin and Huxley 
in squid axon, a voltage-sensitive Na* channel that does 
not inactivate has been identified in mammalian neurons. 
This channel gives rise to a "persistent" Na* current that 
helps regulate action potential threshold and repetitive fir- 
ing. This channel serves as a target of local anesthetics such 
as benzocaine and lidocaine. 
Other electrical responses in neurons entail the activa- 
tion of voltage-gated Ca?* channels (Figure 4.4B). In some 
neurons, voltage-gated Ca"* channels give rise to action 
potentials in much the same way as voltage-sensitive Na* 
channels. In other neurons, Ca?* channels control the shape 
of action potentials generated primarily by Na* conductance 
changes. More generally, by affecting intracellular Ca?* con- 
centrations, the activity of Ca** channels regulates an enor- 
mous range of biochemical signaling processes within cells 
(see Chapter 7). Perhaps the most important brain process

include those activated by the extracellular presence of neu- 
rotransmitters, such as glutamate (E). Other ligand-gated chan- 
nels are activated by intracellular second messengers, such as

regulated by voltage-sensitive Ca?* channels is the 
release of neurotransmitters at synapses (see Chap-. 
ter 5). Given these crucial functions, it is perhaps 
not surprising that 10 different Ca?* channel genes 
(called CACNA genes) have been identified. Like 
Na* channels, Ca?* channels differ in their activa- 
tion and inactivation properties, allowing subtle 
variations in both electrical and chemical signaling 
processes mediated by Ca'. As a result, drugs that 
block voltage-gated Ca** channels are especially 
valuable in treating a variety of conditions ranging 
from heart disease to anxiety disorders. 
By far the largest and most diverse class of volt- 
age-gated ion channels are the K* channels (Fig- 
ure 4.4C). Nearly 100 K* channel genes are known; 
these fall into several distinct groups that differ sub- 
stantially in their activation, gating, and inactivation 
properties. Some take minutes to inactivate, as in 
the case of squid axon K* channels (Figure 4.5A). 
Others inactivate within milliseconds, as is typical of 
most voltage-gated Na* channels (Figure 4.5B), and 
still others even faster (Figure 4.5C). These proper- 
ties influence the duration and rate of action poten- 
tial firing, with important consequences for axonal 
conduction and synaptic transmission. Yet other K* 
channels respond to membrane hyperpolarization 
(Figure 4.5D) or to intracellular Ca** levels (Figure 
4.5E). The 2-P K* channels that are primarily re- 
sponsible for the resting potential of neurons (see 
Chapter 2) have little voltage-dependent gating but 
are sensitive to chemical signals (Figure 4.5F). 
FIGURE 4.5 
Diverse properties of K* channels. 
Different types of K* channels were expressed in Xenopus 
oocytes (see Box 4C), and the voltage clamp method 
was used to change the membrane potential (top) and 
measure the resulting currents flowing through each 
type of channel. These K* channels vary markedly in their 
gating properties, as evident in their currents (left) and 
conductances (right). (A) Ky, channels show little inac- 
tivation and are closely related to the delayed rectifier 
K+ channels involved in action potential repolarization. 
(B) K,,, channels inactivate during a depolarization. (C) 
HERG channels inactivate so rapidly that current flows 
only when inactivation is rapidly removed at the end of 
a depolarization. (D) Inward rectifying K* channels allow 
more K* current to flow at hyperpolarized potentials than 
at depolarized potentials. (E) Ca?*-activated K* channels 
open in response to intracellular Ca** ions and, in some 
cases, membrane depolarization. (F) 2-P K* channels usu- 
ally respond to chemical signals, rather than changes in 
membrane potential. In the case of the TASK channel 
shown here, changes in extracellular pH regulate channel 
opening while membrane potential changes do not.

CHAPTER 4 
Finally, several types of voltage-gated Cl channel have 
been identified (see Figure 4.4D). These channels are pres- 
ent in every type of neuron, where they control excitabil- 
ity, contribute to the resting membrane potential, and help 
regulate cell volume.

Many types of ion channels respond to chemical signals 
(ligands) rather than to changes in the membrane poten- 
tial (Figure 4.4E-G). The most important of these ligand- 
gated ion channels in the nervous system is the class ac- 
tivated by binding neurotransmitters (Figure 4.4E). These 
channels are essential for synaptic transmission and other 
forms of cell-cell signaling phenomena discussed in Chap- 
ters 5-7. Whereas the voltage-gated ion channels underly- 
ing the action potential typically allow only one type of ion 
to permeate, channels activated by extracellular ligands are 
usually less selective, often allowing two or more types of 
ions to flow. 
Other ligand-gated channels are sensitive to chemical 
signals arising within the cytoplasm of neurons (see Chap- 
ter 7), and can be selective for specific ions such as K* or 
Cr, or permeable to all physiological cations. Such chan- 
nels are distinguished by ligand-binding domains on their 
intracellular surfaces that interact with second messengers 
such as Ca**, the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP, or 
protons. Examples of channels that respond to intracellular 
cues include Ca**-activated K* channels (Figure 4.4.F), the 
cyclic nucleotide gated cation channel (Figure 4.4G), and 
acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs). The main function of 
these channels is to convert intracellular chemical signals 
into electrical information. This process is particularly im- 
portant in sensory transduction, where intracellular second 
messenger signals associated with sensory stimuli—such as 
odors and light—are transduced into electrical signals by 
cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. 
Although many ligand-gated ion channels are located in 
the cell surface membrane, others are found in the mem- 
branes of intracellular organelles such as mitochondria or the 
endoplasmic reticulum. Some of these latter channels are se- 
lectively permeable to Ca** and regulate the release of Ca?* 
from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum into the cyto- 
plasm, where this second messenger can trigger a spectrum 
of cellular responses such as those described in Chapter 7. 
Stretch- and Heat-Activated Channels 
Still other ion channels respond to heat or to membrane 
deformation. Heat-activated ion channels, such as some 
members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) gene 
family, contribute to the sensations of pain and temper- 
ature and help mediate inflammation (see Chapter 10). 
These channels are often specialized to detect specific 
temperature ranges, and some are even activated by cold. 
Other ion channels respond to mechanical distortion of the 
plasma membrane and are the basis of stretch receptors and 
neuromuscular stretch reflexes (see Chapters 9, 16, and cy 
A specialized form of these channels apparently enables 
hearing by allowing auditory hair cells to respond to sound 
waves (see Chapter 13). 
In summary, this tremendous variety of ion channels al- 
lows neurons to generate electrical signals in response to 
changes in membrane potential, synaptic input, intracel- 
lular second messengers, light, odors, heat, sound, touch, 
and many other stimuli. 
The Molecular Structure 
of lon Channels 
Understanding the physical structure of ion channels is ob- 
viously key to sorting out how they actually work. Much 
information about channel structure has been derived in- 
directly, from studies of the amino acid composition and 
physiological properties of these proteins. For example, a 
great deal has been learned about the functions of particular 
amino acids within the proteins by using mutagenesis and 
then expressing the resulting mutant channel proteins in 
non-neuronal cells, such as Xenopus oocytes (see Box 4C). 
Such studies have revealed a general transmembrane ar- 
chitecture common to all the major ion channel families. 
These molecules are all integral membrane proteins that 
span the plasma membrane repeatedly. Na* and Ca** chan- 
nel proteins consist of repeating motifs of six membrane- 
spanning regions that are repeated four times, for a total 
of 24 transmembrane regions (Figure 4.6A,B). Na* or Ca?* 
channels can be produced by just one of these proteins, 
although accessory proteins, called 8 subunits, can regulate 
the function of these channels. K* channel proteins typi- 
cally span the membrane six times (Figure 4.6C), though 
there are some K* channels that span the membrane only 
twice (Figure 4.6D), and others that span the membrane 
four times (Figure 4.6F) or seven times (Figure 4.6E). Each 
of these proteins serves as a K* channel subunit, with four 
subunits typically assembling to form a single functional ion 
channel. Most voltage-gated ion channels also contain a 
distinct type of transmembrane helix that possesses a num- 
ber of positively charged amino acids and serves as the volt- 
age sensor that detects changes in the electrical potential 
across the membrane (yellow structures in Figure 4.6). 
FIGURE 4.6 Topology of the principal subunits of voltage- > 
gated Na', Ca*, K*, and Cl channels. Repeating motifs of 
Na* (A) and Ca** (B) channels are labeled |, Il, Ill, and IV; (C-F) K+ 
channels are more diverse. In all cases, four subunits combine to 
form a functional channel. (G) Chloride channels are structurally 
distinct from all other voltage-gated channels. 

Direct information about the structural underpinnings of 
ion channel function has come from X-ray crystallography 
studies of K* channels done by Rod MacKinnon at Rock- 
efeller University (Figure 4.7). The structure of the K* chan- 
nel pore was revealed by studies of a bacterial K+ channel, 
which was chosen for analysis because the large quantity 
of channel protein needed for crystallography could be ob- 
tained by growing large numbers of bacteria. MacKinnon's 
results showed that the channel is formed by subunits that 
each cross the plasma membrane twice; between these 
two helical membrane-spanning structures is a pore loop 
that inserts into the plasma membrane (Figure 4.7A). Four 
subunits are assembled together to form a channel (Figure 
4.7B). In the center of the assembled channel, the channel 
pore can be observed as a narrow tunnel that allows K* to 
flow through the protein and thus cross the membrane. The 
channel pore is formed by the pore loops of each subunit, as 
well as by the membrane-spanning domains. The structure 
of the pore is well suited for conducting K*; the narrowest

the bottleneck (Figure 4.7C). Larger cations, such as Cs', 
cannot traverse this region of the pore, and smaller cations 
such as Na* cannot enter the pore because the pore "walls" 
are too far apart to stabilize a dehydrated Na' ion. This part 
of the channel complex is responsible for the selective per- 
meability to K* and is therefore called the selectivity filter. 
Deeper within the channel is a water-filled cavity that con- 
nects to the interior of the cell. This cavity evidently col- 
lects K* from the cytoplasm and, utilizing negative charges 
from the protein, allows K* ions to become dehydrated so 
they can enter the selectivity filter. These "naked" ions are 
then able to move through four K* binding sites within the 
selectivity filter to eventually reach the extracellular space 
(recall that the physiological concentration gradient nor- 
mally drives K* out of cells). The presence of multiple (up to 
four) K* ions within the selectivity filter causes electrostatic 
repulsion between the ions that helps to speed their transit

Further crystallographic studies of a mammalian volt- 
age-gated K* channel have yielded many structural insights 
into how voltage-dependent gating of ion channels occurs. 
As was the case for the bacterial K* channels described 
above, four subunits assemble to form the voltage-gated 
K* channel (Figure 4.8A). The central pore region of this 
channel is very similar to that of the bacterial K* channels, 
consisting of two membrane-spanning structures and pore 
loops contributed by each of the four subunits (Figure 4.8B). 
This voltage-gated channel has additional structures on its 
cytoplasmic side, such as a 8 subunit and a T1 domain that 
links the 8 subunit to the channel (see Figure 4.8A). Most 
importantly, each channel subunit has four additional trans- 
membrane structures that form the voltage sensors of this 
channel. These voltage sensors can be observed as separate 
domains that extend into the plasma membrane and are 
linked to the central pore of the channel (see Figure 4.8B).

Three-dimensional arrangement of four subunits (each in a different color) to form 
a Kt channel. The right-hand view is from the top of the channel, showing a K* ion 
(yellow) within the channel pore. (C) The permeation pathway of the K* channel 
consists of a large aqueous cavity connected to a narrow selectivity filter. Helical 
domains of the channel point negative charges (green) toward this cavity, allowing 
Kt ions (yellow) to become dehydrated and then move through the selectivity filter. 
(From Doyle et al., 1998.) 
The positive charges within these voltage sensors enable 
movement within the membrane in response to changes 
in membrane potential: depolarization pushes the sensors 
outward, while hyperpolarization pulls them inward. Such 
movements of the sensors then exert force on the helical 
linkers connecting the sensors to the channel pore, pulling 
the channel pore open or pushing it closed (Figure 4.8C). 
Thus, voltage-dependent gating of ion channels can now 
be understood in structural terms. The precise movements 
of the voltage sensor that occur during membrane depo- 
larization are not yet clear and are the subject of consider- 
able debate. One proposal is that depolarization causes the 
paddle-like sensor to flip from one side of the membrane 
to the other (Figure 4.8D). 
In summary, ion channels are integral membrane pro- 
teins with characteristic structures that allow them to 
conduct ions, to sense the transmembrane potential, to 
inactivate, and to bind to various neurotoxins. Detailed 
characterization of the structure of K* channels has yielded 
considerable insight into how ions are conducted from one 
side of the plasma membrane to the other, how a channel 
can be selectively permeable to a single type of ion, how 
channels are able to sense changes in membrane voltage,. 
and how they gate the opening of their pores. It is likely

that other ion channel types are similar to the K* channel 
in their functional architecture. This sort of work also has 
illuminated how mutations in ion channel genes can lead 
to a variety of neurological disorders (Box 4D). 
Active Transporters Create and 
Maintain lon Gradients 
Up to this point, the discussion of the molecular basis of 
electrical signaling has taken for granted the remarkable 
fact that nerve cells maintain ion concentration gradients 
across their surface membranes. However, none of the ions 
of physiological importance (Na*, K*, Cl, and Ca?*) are in 
electrochemical equilibrium. Because channels produce 
electrical effects by allowing one or more of these ions to 
diffuse down their electrochemical gradients, there would 
be a gradual dissipation of these concentration gradients 
unless nerve cells could restore ions displaced during the 
current flow that occurs as a result of both neural signaling 
and the continual ionic leakage that occurs at rest. The work 
of generating and maintaining concentration gradients for 
particular ions is carried out by plasma membrane proteins 
known as active transporters. 
Active transporters carry out their task by forming com- 
plexes with the ions they are translocating. The process of 
ion binding and unbinding for transport typically requires 
several milliseconds. As a result, ion translocation by active 
transporters is much slower than ion movement through 
pushes the voltage sensor toward the extracellular surface of 
the membrane, pulling on the linker (red) and thereby open- 
ing the channel pore (blue). Conversely, hyperpolarization pulls 
the sensor down, pushing down on this linker and shutting the 
channel pore. (D) Model for movement of the voltage sensor. 
Depolarization causes the paddle-like voltage sensor domain to 
move toward the extracellular surface of the membrane, while 
hyperpolarization causes it to move toward the intracellular sur- 
face. (A,B from Long et al., 2005; C from Tao et al., 2010; D after 
Lee, 2006.)

_ Several genetic diseases, collectively 
_ called channelopathies, result from small 
_ but critical mutations in ion channel 
_ genes (Figure A). The best characterized 
of these diseases are those that affect 
skeletal muscle cells. In these disorders, 
alterations in ion channel proteins pro- 
| duce either myotonia (muscle stiffness 
_ due to excessive electrical excitability) 
or paralysis (due to insufficient muscle 
_ excitability). Other disorders arise from 
_ ion channel defects in heart, kidney, 
and the inner ear. 
Channelopathies associated with ion 
~ channels localized in brain are much 
| more difficult to study. Nonetheless, 
voltage-gated Ca** channels have 
_ recently been implicated in a range of 
_ neurological diseases. These include 
episodic ataxia, spinocerebellar degen- 
_ eration, night blindness, and migraine 
_ headaches. Familial hemiplegic migraine 
_ (FHM) is characterized by migraine 
attacks that typically last one to three 
days. During such episodes, patients 
experience severe headaches and vom- 
_ 
iting. Several mutations in a human 
Ca?* channel have been identified in 
' families with FHM, each having differ- 
_ ent clinical symptoms. For example, a 
mutation in the pore-forming region 
_ of the channel produces hemiplegic 
migraine with progressive cerebellar 
ataxia, whereas other mutations cause 
only the usual FHM symptoms. How 
these altered Ca** channel properties 
lead to migraine attacks is not known. 
Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) is a neu- 
rological disorder in which affected 
individuals suffer recurrent attacks of 
abnormal limb movements and severe 
ataxia. These problems are sometimes 
accompanied by vertigo, nausea, and 
headache. Attacks usually are precipi- 
tated by emotional stress, exercise, or 
alcohol and last for a few hours. The 
mutations in EA2 cause Ca** channels to

Barchi, 1995.) 
A defect in brain Na* channels causes 
generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures 
(GEFS), which begins in infancy and 
usually continues through early puberty. 
This defect has been mapped to two 
mutations: one on chromosome 2 that 
encodes an a subunit for a voltage-gated 
Na* channel, and the other on chromo- 
some 19 that encodes a Na* channel 8 
subunit. These mutations cause a slow- 
ing of Na* channel inactivation (Figure 
B), which may explain the neuronal 
hyperexcitability underlying GEFS. 
Another type of seizure, benign famil- 
ial neonatal convulsion (BFNC), is due to 
K* channel mutations. This disease is 
characterized by frequent brief seizures 
commencing within the first week of 
life and disappearing spontaneously 
within a few months. The mutation has 
been mapped to at least two voltage- 
gated K* channel genes. A reduction in 
K* current flow through the mutated 
channels probably accounts for the 
hyperexcitability associated with this 
defect. A related disease, episodic ataxia 
type 1 (EA1), has been linked to a defect 
in another type of voltage-gated K* 
channel. EA1 is characterized by brief 
episodes of ataxia. Mutant channels 
inhibit the function of other, non- 
mutant K* channels and may produce 
clinical symptoms by impairing action 
potential repolarization. Mutations in 
the K* channels of cardiac muscle are 
responsible for the irregular heartbeat 
of patients with long Q-T syndrome. 
Numerous genetic disorders affect 
the voltage-gated channels of skeletal 
muscle and are responsible for a host 
of muscle diseases that either cause 
muscle weakness (paralysis) or muscle 
contraction (myotonia).

ION CHANNELS AND TRANSPORTERS 
71 
channels (recall that ion channels can conduct thousands of 
ions across a membrane each millisecond). In short, active 
transporters gradually store energy in the form of ion con- 
centration gradients, whereas the opening of ion channels 
rapidly dissipates this stored energy during relatively brief 
electrical signaling events. 
Several types of active transporter have been identified 
(Figure 4.9). Although the specific jobs of these transporters 
differ, all must translocate ions against their electrochemi- 
cal gradients. Moving ions uphill requires the consumption 
of energy, and neuronal transporters fall into two classes 
based on their energy source. ATPase pumps acquire en- 
ergy directly from the hydrolysis of ATP. The most promi- 
nent example of an ATPase pump is the Na* pump (or, 
more properly, the Na*/K* ATPase pump), which is re- 
sponsible for maintaining transmembrane concentration 
gradients for both Na* and K* (Figure 4.9A). Another is the 
Ca? pump, which provides one of the main mechanisms for 
removing Ca? from cells (Figure 4.9B). Two different types 
of Ca** pump have been identified. One, called PMCA, is 
found on the plasma membrane; the other, termed SERCA, 
is used to store Ca** within the endoplasmic reticulum (see 
Chapter 7). 
A second class of active transporter does not use ATP 
directly but instead uses the electrochemical gradients of 
other ions as an energy source. Such transporters carry 
one or more ions up its electrochemical gradient while si- 
multaneously taking another ion (most often Na*) down 
its gradient. These transporters can be further subdivided 
into two types according to the direction of ion movement. 
As the name of the first type implies, ion exchangers ex- 
change intracellular and extracellular ions. An example of 
such a transporter is the Na*/Ca** exchanger, which shares 
with the Ca?* pump the important job of keeping intracel- 
lular Ca?* concentrations low (Figure 4.9C). Another ion 
exchanger, the Na*/H* exchanger, regulates intracellular 
pH (Figure 4.9D). Transporters of the second type, the co- 
transporters, work by carrying multiple ions in the same

FIGURE 4.9 Examples of active transporters. Some trans- 
porters (A,B) are powered by the hydrolysis of ATP (ATPase 
pumps), whereas others use the electrochemical gradients of co- 
transported ions as a source of energy. The latter can be further 
subdivided into ion exchangers that swap ions on the two sides 
of the membrane (C,D) and co-transporters that carry multiple 
ions in the same direction (E-G). 
direction. Two such co-transporters regulate intracellular 
Cl concentration by translocating Cl along with extracel- 
lular Na* and/or K*; these are the Na*/K*/CI co-transporter, 
which transports Cl along with Na* and K* into cells (Fig- 
ure 4.9E), and the K*/Cl co-transporter, which swaps in- 
tracellular Cl for extracellular K* (Figure 4.9F). As we will 
see in Chapter 6, neurotransmitters are transported into 
synaptic terminals and glial cells via other co-transporters 
(Figure 4.9G). Although the electrochemical gradient of Na* 
(or other counter-ions) is the proximate source of energy 
for both ion exchangers and co-transporters, these gradi- 
ents ultimately depend on the hydrolysis of ATP by ATPase 
pumps such as the Na*/K* ATPase pump. 
Functional Properties of the 
Na'*/K* Pump 
The best understood active transporter is the 
Na*/K* pump. 
Its crucial importance for brain function is evident from 
the fact that this transporter accounts for 20%—40% of the 
brain's total energy consumption. The Na* pump was first 
discovered in neurons in the 1950s, when Richard Keynes 
at Cambridge University used radioactive Na* to demon- 
strate the energy-dependent efflux of Na* from squid giant 
axons. Keynes and his collaborators found that this efflux 
ceased when the axon's supply of ATP was interrupted by 
treatment with metabolic poisons (Figure 4.10A, point 4). 
Other conditions that lowered intracellular ATP also pre- 
vented Na* efflux. These experiments showed that remov- 
ing intracellular Na* requires cellular metabolism. Further

studies with radioactive K* demonstrated that Na* efflux 
is associated with the simultaneous ATP-dependent influx 
of K*. These opposing fluxes of Na* and K* are operation- 
ally inseparable—removal of external K* greatly reduces 
Na* efflux (Figure 4.10A, point 2), and vice versa. These 
energy-dependent movements of Na* and K* implicated 
an ATP-hydrolyzing Na*/K* pump in the generation of the 
transmembrane gradients of both Na* and K*. The pump is 
thought to alternately shuttle Na* and K* across the mem- 
branes in a cycle fueled by the transfer of a phosphate group 
from ATP to the pump protein, which switches the pump 
from removing intracellular Na* to accumulating intracel- 
lular K* (Figure 4.10B). 
Quantitative studies of the movements of Na* and K* 
indicate that the two ions are not pumped at identical rates. 
The rate of K* influx is only about two-thirds that of Na* ef- 
flux. Thus, the pump transports 2 K* into the cell for every 3 
Na* that are removed (see Figure 4.10B). This stoichiometry 
causes a net loss of one positively charged ion from inside 
of the cell during each round of pumping, meaning that the 
pump generates an electrical current that can hyperpolarize 
the membrane potential. For this reason, the Na*/K* pump 
is said to be electrogenic. However, because pumps act 
much more slowly than ion channels, the current produced 
by the Na*/K* pump is quite small. For example, in the 
squid axon, the electrical current generated by the pump is 
less than 1% of the current flowing through voltage-gated 
Na* channels and affects the resting membrane potential 
by only a millivolt or less. 
The Molecular Structure 
of ATPase Pumps 
The preceding observations imply that the Na*/K* pump 
must exhibit several molecular properties. First, it must 
bind both Na* and K*; second, it must possess sites that 
bind ATP and receive a phosphate group from this ATP;

and finally, it must bind ouabain, the toxin that 
blocks this pump (Figure 4.11A). A variety of 
studies have identified the structures of the Na*/ 
K* pump that account for all three of these prop- 
erties. This pump is a large, integral membrane 
protein made up of at least two subunits, called 
a and B. The primary sequence shows that the a 
subunit spans the membrane 10 times, with most 
of the molecule found on the cytoplasmic side, 
whereas the 8 subunit spans the membrane only 
once and is predominantly extracellular. Analysis 
of its amino acid sequence has identified structures 
involved in some of the pump's functions (Figure 
4.11B). One intracellular domain, the nucleotide- 
binding domain, is required for ATP binding and 
hydrolysis, and the amino acid phosphorylated by 
ATP has been identified. An extracellular domain 
represents the binding site for ouabain. Crystallo- 
graphic analysis of the Na*/K*pump reveals these 
structures in much greater detail (Figure 4.11C). 
Most importantly, such analyses reveal that two K* 
bind to the interior of the pump, within its mem- 
brane-spanning domain. This presumably reflects 
the conformation of the pump when it is translo- 
cating K* into the cell. 
Further insights into the structural basis of ion 
translocation have been obtained for a Ca** ATPase 
that is closely related to the Na*/K* pump. This 
pump uses ATP hydrolysis to power the transloca- 
tion of Ca?* from cytoplasm across the membrane

of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, an intracellular Ca** storage 
organelle of muscle that is analogous to the endoplasmic 
reticulum. The Ca** pump, like the Na*/K* pump, is a very 
large membrane protein than spans the membrane 10 times 
and consists of several domains (Figure 4.12A). Very similar 
to the Na*/K* pump, the Ca** pump possesses a nucleotide- 
binding domain that binds ATP/ADP, while other domains 
are involved in pump phosphorylation and ion transloca- 
tion. Just like the Na*/K* pump, phosphorylation of the Ca** 
pump fuels a cycle of conformational changes. By examin- 
ing the structure of the Ca** pump at different stages of 
this cycle, the mechanism of Ca** translocation has been 
clarified. Ca** first binds to the cytoplasmic side of the pump 
and then is driven through the membrane as a result of 
phosphorylation-induced conformational changes in the 
membrane-spanning domains, ultimately resulting in Ca?* 
being released on the other side of the membrane (Figure 
4.12B). Unlike ion channels, where ion translocation occurs 
by diffusion-based movement through an aqueous pore, 
translocation of Ca** by the pump occurs by sequestering 
the ion deeply within the protein, away from the aqueous 
medium. This explains how the pump is able to move Ca** 
uphill, against the steep electrochemical gradient for Ca?* 
present across the membrane, and presumably also ex- 
plains how the Na*/K* pump generates uphill movement 
of Na* and K'. 
Summary 
Ion channels and active transporters have complemen- 
tary functions. The primary purpose of transporters is to 
generate transmembrane concentration gradients, which 
are then exploited by ion channels to generate electri- 
cal signals. Ion channels are responsible for the voltage- 
dependent conductances of nerve cell membranes. The 
channels underlying the action potential are integral mem- 
brane proteins that open or close ion-selective pores in re- 
sponse to the membrane potential, allowing specific ions to 
diffuse across the membrane. The flow of ions through sin- 
gle open channels can be detected as tiny electrical currents, 
and the synchronous opening of many channels generates 
the macroscopic currents that produce action potentials. 
Molecular studies show that such voltage-gated channels 
have highly conserved structures that are responsible for 
features such as ion permeation and voltage sensing, as 
well as the features that specify ion selectivity and toxin 
sensitivity. Other types of channels are sensitive to chemical 
signals, such as neurotransmitters or second messengers, Or 
to heat or membrane deformation. A large number of ion 
channel genes create channels with a correspondingly wide 
range of functional characteristics, thus allowing different 
types of neurons to have a remarkable spectrum of electrical 
properties. Active transporter proteins are quite different in 
both structure and function. The energy needed to move 
ions against a concentration gradient (e.g., in maintaining 
the resting potential) is provided either by the hydrolysis of 
ATP or by the electrochemical gradient of co-transported 
ions. The Na*/K* pump produces and maintains the trans- 
membrane gradients of Na* and K*, while other transport- 
ers are responsible for the electrochemical gradients for 
other physiologically important ions, including Cl-, Ca?*, 
and H*. Together, transporters and channels provide a rea- 
sonably comprehensive molecular explanation for the abil- 
ity of neurons to generate electrical signals.

SYNAPTIC [TRANSMISSION 
Overview 
THE HUMAN BRAIN CONTAINS AT LEAST 100 BILLION NEURONS, each with 
the ability to influence many other cells. Clearly, sophisticated and highly efficient 
mechanisms are needed to enable communication among this astronomical num- 
ber of elements. Such communication is made possible by synapses, the functional 
contacts between neurons. Two different types of synapses—electrical and chemi- 
cal—can be distinguished on the basis of their mechanism of transmission. At electri- 
cal synapses, current flows through gap junctions, which are specialized membrane 
channels that connect two cells. In contrast, chemical synapses enable cell-to-cell 
communication via the secretion of neurotransmitters; these chemical agents re- 
leased by the presynaptic neurons produce secondary current flow in postsynaptic 
neurons by activating specific receptor molecules. The total number of neurotrans- 
mitters is well over 100. Virtually all neurotransmitters undergo a similar cycle of 
use: synthesis and packaging into synaptic vesicles; release from the presynaptic cell; 
binding to postsynaptic receptors; and, finally, rapid removal and/or degradation. The 
influx of Ca?* through voltage-gated channels triggers the secretion of neurotransmit- 
ters; this, in turn, gives rise to a transient increase in Ca** concentration within the 
presynaptic terminal. The rise in Ca** concentration causes synaptic vesicles to fuse 
with the presynaptic plasma membrane and release their contents into the space 
between the pre- and postsynaptic cells. Although it is not yet understood exactly 
how Ca?* triggers exocytosis, specific proteins on the surface of the synaptic vesicle 
and the presynaptic plasma membrane mediate this process. Neurotransmitters 
evoke postsynaptic electrical responses by binding to members of a diverse group of 
neurotransmitter receptors. There are two major classes of receptors: those in which 
the receptor molecule is also an ion channel, and those in which the receptor and 
ion channel are separate entities. These receptors give rise to electrical signals by 
transmitter-induced opening or closing of the ion channels. Whether the postsynap- 
tic actions of a particular neurotransmitter are excitatory or inhibitory is determined 
by the ionic permeability of the ion channel affected by the transmitter, and by the 
electrochemical gradient for the peremeant ions.

CHAPTER 5 
Electrical Synapses 
The many kinds of synapses within the human brain fall 
into two general classes: electrical synapses and chemical 
synapses. Although they are a distinct minority, electri- 
cal synapses are found in all nervous systems and permit 
direct, passive flow of electrical current from one neuron 
to another. The structure of an electrical synapse is shown 
schematically in Figure 5.1. The "upstream" neuron, which 
is the source of current, is called the presynaptic element, 
and the "downstream" neuron into which this current 
flows is termed postsynaptic. The membranes of the two 
communicating neurons come extremely close at the syn- 
apse and are actually linked together by an intercellular 
specialization called a gap junction. Gap junctions con- 
tain precisely aligned, paired channels called connexons.

Connexons are present in the membranes of both the pre- 
and postsynaptic neurons; six presynaptic connexins align 
with six postsynaptic connexins to form a pore that con- 
nects the two cells (Figure 5.1C). The pore of a connexon 
channel is much larger than the pores of the voltage-gated 
ion channels described in the previous chapter. As a result,

a variety of substances can simply diffuse between the cyto- 
plasm of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. In addition to 
ions, substances that diffuse through gap junction pores in- 
clude molecules with molecular weights as great as several 
hundred daltons. This permits ATP and other important 
intracellular metabolites, such as second messengers (see 
Chapter 7), to be transferred between neurons. Connexons 
are composed of a special family of ion channel proteins, 
the connexins (Figure 5.1D). There are several different

types of connexins, found in different cell types and yield- 
ing gap junctions with diverse physiological properties. 
Electrical synapses work by allowing ionic current to flow 
passively through the gap junction pores from one neuron 
to another. The usual source of this current is the poten- 
tial difference generated locally by the presynaptic action 
potential (see Chapter 3). This arrangement has a number 
of interesting consequences. One is that transmission can 
be bidirectional; that is, current can flow in either direction 
across the gap junction, depending on which member of 
the coupled pair is invaded by an action potential (although 
some types of gap junctions have special features that render 
their transmission unidirectional). Another important feature 
of the electrical synapse is that transmission is extraordinarily 
fast: because passive current flow across the gap junction is 
virtually instantaneous, communication can occur without 
the delay that is characteristic of chemical synapses. 
These features are apparent in the operation of the first 
electrical synapse to be discovered, which resides in the 
crayfish nervous system. A postsynaptic electrical signal is 
observed at this synapse within a fraction of a millisecond 
after the generation of a presynaptic action potential (Fig- 
ure 5.2A). In fact, at least part of this brief synaptic delay is 
caused by propagation of the action potential into the pre- 
synaptic terminal, so that there may be essentially no delay 
in the transmission of electrical signals across the synapse. 
Such synapses interconnect many of the neurons within the 
circuit that allows the crayfish to escape from its predators, 
thus minimizing the time between the presence of a threat- 
ening stimulus and a potentially lifesaving motor response. 
A more general purpose of electrical synapses is 
to synchronize electrical activity among populations 
of neurons. For example, the brainstem neurons 
that generate rhythmic electrical activity underlying 
breathing are synchronized by electrical synapses, as 
are populations of interneurons in the cerebral cortex, 
thalamus, cerebellum, and other brain regions (Figure 
5.2B). Electrical transmission between vasopressin- 
and oxytocin-secreting neurons within the hypothala- 
mus ensures that all cells fire action potentials at about 
the same time, thus facilitating a burst of secretion of 
these hormones into the circulation (see Box 21A). 
FIGURE 5.2 
Function of gap junctions at electrical 
synapses. (A) Rapid transmission of signals at an electrical 
synapse in the crayfish. An action potential in the presynap- 
tic neuron causes the postsynaptic neuron to be depolar- 
ized within a fraction of a millisecond. (B) Electrical synapses 
allow synchronization of electrical activity in hippocampal 
interneurons. In a pair of interneurons connected by elec- 
trical synapses, generation of an action potential in one 
neuron often results in the synchronized firing of an action 
potential in another neuron. (A after Furshpan and Potter, 
1959; B after Beierlein et al., 2000.) 

80 
CHAPTER 5 
The fact that gap junction pores are large enough to allow 
molecules such as ATP and second messengers to diffuse 
between cells also permits electrical synapses to coordinate 
the intracellular signaling and metabolism of coupled cells. 
This property may be particularly important for glial cells, 
which form large intracellular signaling networks via their 
gap junctions.

synapses than at electrical synapses and is called the synap- 
tic cleft. However, the key feature of all chemical synapses 
is the presence of small, membrane-bounded organelles 
called synaptic vesicles within the presynaptic terminal. 
These spherical organelles are filled with one or more neu- 
rotransmitters, the chemical signals secreted from the pre- 
synaptic neuron, and it is these chemical agents acting as 
messengers between the communicating neurons that gives 
this type of synapse its name. 
Transmission at chemical synapses is based on the elab- 
orate sequence of events depicted in Figure 5.3. The process

is initiated when an action potential invades the terminal 
of the presynaptic neuron. The change in membrane po- 
tential caused by the arrival of the action potential leads 
to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels in the 
presynaptic membrane. Because of the steep concentration 
gradient of Ca** across the presynaptic membrane (the ex- 
ternal Ca** concentration is approximately 10° M, whereas 
the internal Ca** concentration is approximately 10? M), 
the opening of these channels causes a rapid influx of Ca* 
into the presynaptic terminal, with the result that the Ca? 
concentration of the cytoplasm in the terminal transiently 
rises to a much higher value. Elevation of the presynaptic 
Ca** concentration, in turn, allows synaptic vesicles to fuse 
with the plasma membrane of the presynaptic neuron. The 
Ca**-dependent fusion of synaptic vesicles with the termi- 
nal membrane causes their contents, most importantly neu- 
rotransmitters, to be released into the synaptic cleft. 
Following exocytosis, transmitters diffuse across the syn- 
aptic cleft and bind to specific receptors on the membrane 
of the postsynaptic neuron. The binding of neurotransmit- 
ter to the receptors causes channels in the postsynaptic 
membrane to open (or sometimes to close), thus changing 
the ability of ions to flow into (or out of) the postsynaptic 
cells. The resulting neurotransmitter-induced current flow 
alters the conductance and (usually) the membrane poten- 
tial of the postsynaptic neuron, increasing or decreasing 
the probability that the neuron will fire an action potential. 
Subsequent removal of the neurotransmitter from the syn- 
aptic cleft, by uptake into glial cells or by enzymatic deg- 
radation, terminates the action of the neurotransmitter. In 
this way, information is transmitted transiently from one 
neuron to another.

Properties of Neurotransmitters 
The notion that electrical information can be transferred 
from one neuron to the next by means of chemical signal- 
ing was the subject of intense debate through the first half 
of the twentieth century. In 1926, the German physiologist 
Otto Loewi performed a key experiment that supported this 
idea. Acting on an idea that allegedly came to him in the 
middle of the night, Loewi proved that electrical stimula- 
tion of the vagus nerve slows the heartbeat by releasing a 
chemical signal. He isolated and perfused the hearts of two 
frogs, monitoring the rates at which they were beating (Fig- 
ure 5.4), When the vagus nerve innervating the first heart 
was stimulated, the beat of this heart slowed. Remarkably, 
even though the vagus nerve of the second heart had not 
been stimulated, its beat also slowed when exposed to the 
perfusate from the first heart. This result showed that the 
vagus nerve regulates the heart rate by releasing a chemi- 
cal that accumulates in the perfusate. Originally referred 
to as "vagus substance," the agent was later shown to be 
acetylcholine (ACh). ACh is now known to be a neu- 
rotransmitter that acts not only in the heart but also at a 
variety of postsynaptic targets in the central and peripheral 
nervous systems, preeminently at the neuromuscular junc- 
tion of striated muscles and in the visceral motor system 
(see Chapters 6 and 21). 
Over the years, a number of formal criteria have emerged 
that definitively identify a substance as a neurotransmitter 
FIGURE 5.4 
Loewi's experiment demonstrated chemical 
neurotransmission. (A) Loewi's experimental setup. (B) Where 
the vagus nerve of an isolated frog's heart was stimulated, the

heart was transferred to a second heart, the second heart's rate 
decreased as well (lower panel).

CHAPTER 5 
(Box 5A). These have led to the identification of more than 
100 different neurotransmitters, which can be classified into 
two broad categories: small-molecule neurotransmitters and 
neuropeptides (see Chapter 6). Having more than one trans- 
mitter diversifies the physiological repertoire of synapses. 
Multiple neurotransmitters can produce different types of 
responses on individual postsynaptic cells. For example, a 
neuron can be excited by one type of neurotransmitter and 
inhibited by another type of neurotransmitter. The speed of 
postsynaptic responses produced by different transmitters 
also differs, allowing control of electrical signaling over dif- 
ferent time scales. In general, small-molecule neurotransmit- 
ters mediate rapid synaptic actions, whereas neuropeptides 
tend to modulate slower, ongoing synaptic functions. 
Until relatively recently, it was believed that a given 
neuron produced only a single type of neurotransmitter. 
It is now clear, however, that many types of neurons syn- 
thesize and release two or more different neurotransmit- 
ters. When more than one transmitter is present within a 
nerve terminal, the molecules are called co-transmitters. 
Because different types of transmitters can be packaged in 
different populations of synaptic vesicles, co-transmitters 
need not be released simultaneously. When peptide and 
small-molecule neurotransmitters act as co-transmitters at 
the same synapse, they are differentially released according 
to the pattern of synaptic activity: low-frequency activity 
often results in the release of only small neurotransmitters, 
whereas high-frequency activity is required to release neu- 
ropeptides from the same presynaptic terminals. As a result, 
the chemical signaling properties of such synapses change 
according to the rate of activity. 
Effective synaptic transmission requires close control of 
the concentration of neurotransmitters within the synap- 
tic cleft. Neurons have therefore developed a sophisticated 
ability to regulate the synthesis, packaging, release, and 
degradation (or removal) of neurotransmitters to achieve 
the desired levels of transmitter molecules. The synthesis 
of small-molecule neurotransmitters occurs locally within 
presynaptic terminals (Figure 5.5A). The enzymes needed 
to synthesize these transmitters are produced in the neu- 
ronal cell body and are then transported to the nerve ter- 
minal cytoplasm at a rate of 0.5-5.0 millimeters a day by 
a mechanism called slow axonal transport. The precursor 
molecules required to make new molecules of neurotrans- 
mitter are usually taken into the nerve terminal by trans- 
porters found in the plasma membrane of the terminal. The 
enzymes synthesize neurotransmitters in the cytoplasm 
of the presynaptic terminal, and the transmitters are then 
loaded into synaptic vesicles via transporters in the vesicular 
membrane (see Chapter 4). For some small-molecule neu- 
rotransmitters, the final steps of synthesis occur inside the 
synaptic vesicles. Most small-molecule neurotransmitters 
are packaged in vesicles 40-60 nm in diameter, the centers 
of which appear clear in electron micrographs; accordingly, 
FIGURE 5.5 Metabolism of small-molecule and peptide 
transmitters. (A) Small-molecule neurotransmitters are synthe- 
sized at nerve terminals. The enzymes necessary for neurotrans- 
mitter synthesis are made in the cell body of the presynaptic 
cell (1) and are transported down the axon by slow axonal trans- 
port (2). Precursors are taken up into the terminals by specific 
transporters, and neurotransmitter synthesis and packaging 
take place within the nerve endings (3). After vesicle fusion and 
release (4), the neurotransmitter may be enzymatically degraded. 
The reuptake of the neurotransmitter (or its metabolites) begins 
another cycle of synthesis, packaging, release, and removal (5). 
(B) Small clear-core vesicles at a synapse between a presynaptic 
terminal and a dendritic spine in the central nervous system. 
Such vesicles typically contain small-molecule neurotransmitters. 
(© Peptide neurotransmitters, as well as the enzymes that mod- 
ify their precursors, are synthesized in the cell body (1). Enzymes 
and propeptides are packaged into vesicles in the Golgi appa- 
ratus. During fast axonal transport of these vesicles to the nerve 
terminals (2), the enzymes modify the propeptides to produce 
one or more neurotransmitter peptides (3). After vesicle fusion 
and exocytosis, the peptides diffuse away and are degraded by 
proteolytic enzymes (4). (D) Large dense-core vesicles in a central 
presynaptic terminal synapsing onto a dendrite. Such vesicles 
typically contain neuropeptides or, in some cases, biogenic 
amines. (B and D from Peters, Palay, and Webster, 1991.) 
these vesicles are referred to as small clear-core vesicles 
(Figure 5.5B). Neuropeptides are synthesized in the cell 
body of a neuron, meaning that the peptide is produced a 
long distance away from its site of secretion (Figure 5.5C). 
To solve this problem, peptide-filled vesicles are transported 
along an axon and down to the synaptic terminal via fast 
axonal transport. This process carries vesicles at rates up to 
400 mm/day along cytoskeletal elements called microtubules 
(in contrast with the slow axonal transport of the enzymes 
that synthesize small-molecule transmitters). Microtubules 
are long, cylindrical filaments, 25 nm in diameter, present 
throughout neurons and other celis. Peptide-containing 
vesicles move along these microtubule "tracks" by ATP- 
requiring "motor" proteins such as kinesin. Neuropeptides 
are packaged into synaptic vesicles that range from 90-250 
nm in diameter. Because the center of these vesicles appear 
electron-dense in electron micrographs, they are referred to 
as large dense-core vesicles (Figure 5.5D). 
After a neurotransmitter has been secreted into the syn- 
aptic cleft, it must be removed to enable the postsynaptic 
cell to engage in another cycle of synaptic transmission. The 
removal of neurotransmitters involves diffusion away from 
the postsynaptic receptors, in combination with reuptake 
into nerve terminals or surrounding glial cells, degradation 
by specific enzymes, or a combination of these mechanisms. 
Specific transporter proteins remove most small-molecule 
neurotransmitters (or their metabolites) from the synaptic 
> 
cleft, ultimately delivering them back to the presynaptic ter- 
minal for reuse (see Chapter 6).

CHAPTER 5 
BOX 5A Criteria That Define a Neurotransmitter 
Three primary criteria have been used 
to confirm that a molecule acts as a 
neurotransmitter at a given chemical 
synapse, 
_ 1. The substance must be present within 
| 
the presynaptic neuron. Clearly, a 
_ 
chemical cannot be secreted from 
a presynaptic neuron unless it is 
present there. Because elaborate 
_ biochemical pathways are required 
_ 
to produce neurotransmitters, show- 
| ing that the enzymes and precursors 
required to synthesize the substance 
are present in presynaptic neurons 
provides additional evidence that the 
substance is used as a transmitter. 
_ 
Note, however, that since the trans- 
| 
mitters glutamate, glycine, and aspar- 
tate are also needed for protein syn- 
thesis and other metabolic reactions

in all neurons, their presence is not 
sufficient evidence to establish them 
as neurotransmitters. 
2. The substance must be released in 
response to presynaptic depolarization, 
and the release must be Ca**-depen- 
dent. Another essential criterion for 
identifying a neurotransmitter is to 
demonstrate that it is released from 
the presynaptic neuron in response 
to presynaptic electrical activity, 
and that this release requires Ca* 
influx into the presynaptic terminal. 
Meeting this criterion is technically 
challenging, not only because it may 
be difficult to selectively stimulate 
the presynaptic neurons, but also 
because enzymes and transport- 
ers efficiently remove the secreted 
neurotransmitters. 
Ey Neurotransmitter 
receptors activated 
3. Specific receptors for the substance must 
be present on the postsynaptic cell. A 
neurotransmitter cannot act on its 
target unless specific receptors for 
the transmitter are present in the 
postsynaptic membrane. One way to 
demonstrate the presence of recep- 
tors is to show that application of 
exogenous transmitter mimics the 
postsynaptic effect of presynaptic 
stimulation. A more rigorous dem- 
onstration is to show that agonists 
and antagonists that alter the normal 
postsynaptic response have the same 
effect when the substance in question 
is applied exogenously. High-reso- 
lution histological methods can also 
be used to show that specific recep- 
tors are present in the postsynaptic 
membrane (by detection of radioac- 
tively labeled receptor antibodies, for 
example). 
Fulfilling these criteria establishes 
unambiguously that a substance is used 
as a transmitter at a given synapse. 
Practical difficulties, however, have 
prevented these standards from being 
applied at many types of synapses. It is 
for this reason that so many substances 
must be referred to as "putative" 
neurotransmitters. 
Demonstrating the identity of a neuro- 
transmitter at a synapse requires show- 
ing (1) its presence, (2) its release, and 
(3) the postsynaptic presence of specific 
receptors. 
Quantal Release of Neurotransmitters 
Much of the evidence leading to the present understanding 
of chemical synaptic transmission was obtained from ex- 
periments examining the release of ACh at neuromuscular 
junctions. These synapses between spinal motor neurons 
and skeletal muscle cells are simple, large, and peripherally 
located, making them particularly amenable to experimen- 
tal analysis. Such synapses occur at specializations called 
end plates because of the saucer-like appearance of the site 
on the muscle fiber where the presynaptic axon elaborates 
its terminals (Figure 5.6A). Most of the pioneering work 
on neuromuscular transmission was performed during the 
1950s and 1960s by Bernard Katz and his collaborators at 
University College London, and Katz has been widely rec- 
ognized for his remarkable contributions to understanding 
synaptic transmission. Though he worked primarily on the 
frog neuromuscular junction, numerous subsequent experi- 
ments have confirmed the applicability of his observations 
to transmission at all chemical synapses. 
When an intracellular microelectrode is used to record 
the membrane potential of a muscle cell, an action potential 
in the presynaptic motor neuron can be seen to elicit a tran- 
sient depolarization of the postsynaptic muscle fiber. This 
change in membrane potential, called an end plate poten- 
tial (EPP), is normally large enough to bring the membrane 
potential of the muscle cell well above the threshold for 
producing a postsynaptic action potential (Figure 5.6B). The

postsynaptic action potential triggered by the EPP causes 
the muscle fiber to contract. Unlike the case for electrical 
synapses, there is a pronounced delay between the time 
that the presynaptic motor neuron is stimulated and when 
the EPP occurs in the postsynaptic muscle cell. Such a delay 
is characteristic of all chemical synapses. 
One of Katz's seminal findings, in studies carried out 
with Paul Fatt in 1951, was that spontaneous changes in 
muscle cell membrane potential occur even in the absence 
of stimulation of the presynaptic motor neuron (Figure 
5.6C). These changes have the same shape as EPPs but are 
much smaller (typically less than 1 mV in amplitude, com- 
pared with an EPP of more than 50 mV). Both EPPs and 
these small, spontaneous events are sensitive to pharmaco- 
logical agents that block postsynaptic acetylcholine recep- 
tors, such as curare (see Box 6A). These and other parallels 
between EPPs and the spontaneously occurring depolariza- 
tions led Katz and his colleagues to call these spontaneous 
events miniature end plate potentials, or MEPPs. 
The relationship between the full-blown end plate po- 
tential and MEPPs was clarified by careful analysis of the 
EPPs. The magnitude of the EPP provides a convenient 
electrical assay of neurotransmitter secretion from a motor 
neuron terminal; however, measuring it is complicated by 
the need to prevent muscle contraction from dislodging the 
microelectrode. The usual means of eliminating muscle con- 
tractions is either to lower Ca?* concentration in the extra- 
cellular medium or to partially block the postsynaptic ACh 
receptors with the drug curare. As expected from the scheme 
illustrated in Figure 5.3, lowering the Ca** concentration re- 
duces neurotransmitter secretion, thus reducing the magni- 
tude of the EPP below the threshold for postsynaptic action

stimulation of a motor neuron are normally above threshold and therefore produce an action 
potential in the postsynaptic muscle cell. (C) Spontaneous miniature EPPs (MEPPs) occur in

potential production and allowing it to be measured more 
precisely. Under such conditions, stimulation of the motor 
neuron produces very small EPPs that fluctuate in ampli- 
tude from trial to trial (Figure 5.6D). These fluctuations give 
considerable insight into the mechanisms responsible for 
neurotransmitter release. In particular, the variable evoked 
response in low Ca"* is now known to result from the release 
of unit amounts of ACh by the presynaptic nerve terminal. 
Indeed, the amplitude of the smallest evoked response 
is strikingly similar to the size of single MEPPs (compare 
Figures 5.6C and D). Further supporting this similarity, in- 
crements in the EPP response (Figure 5.7A) occur in units 
about the size of single MEPPs (Figure 5.7B). These "quan- 
tal" fluctuations in the amplitude of EPPs indicated to Katz 
and his colleague, Jose del Castillo, that EPPs are made up 
of individual units, each equivalent to a MEPP. 
The idea that EPPs represent the simultaneous release of 
many MEPP-like units can be tested statistically. A method 
of statistical analysis based on the independent occurrence 
of unitary events (called Poisson statistics) predicts what 
the distribution of EPP amplitudes would look like during 
a large number of trials of motor neuron stimulation, under 
the assumption that EPPs are built up from unitary events 
represented by MEPPs (see Figure 5.7B). The distribution 
of EPP amplitudes determined experimentally was found 
to be just that expected if transmitter release from the mo- 
tor neuron is indeed quantal (the red curve in Figure 5.7A). 
Such analyses confirmed the idea that release of acetylcho- 
line does indeed occur in discrete packets, each equivalent 
to a MEPP. In short, a presynaptic action potential causes 
a postsynaptic EPP because it synchronizes the release of 
many transmitter quanta.

Release of Transmitters from 
Synaptic Vesicles 
The discovery of the quantal release of packets of neu- 
rotransmitter immediately raised the question of how 
such quanta are formed and discharged into the synaptic 
cleft. At about the time Katz and his colleagues were us- 
ing physiological methods to discover quantal release of 
neurotransmitter, electron microscopy revealed, for the 
first time, the presence of synaptic vesicles in presynap- 
tic terminals. Putting these two discoveries together, Katz 
and others proposed that synaptic vesicles loaded with 
transmitter are the source of the quanta. Subsequent bio- 
chemical studies confirmed that synaptic vesicles are the 
repositories of transmitters. These studies have shown that 
ACh is highly concentrated in the synaptic vesicles of mo- 
tor neurons, where it is present at a concentration of about 
100 mM. Given the diameter of a small clear-core synaptic 
FIGURE 5.7 
Quantized distribution of 
EPP amplitudes evoked in a low-Ca** 
solution. Peaks of EPP amplitudes (A) tend 
to occur in integer multiples of the mean 
amplitude of MEPPs, whose amplitude dis- 
tribution is shown in (B). The leftmost bar 
in the EPP amplitude distribution shows 
trials in which presynaptic stimulation 
failed to elicit an EPP in the muscle cell. 
The red curve indicates the prediction of a 
statistical model based on the assumption 
that the EPPs result from the independent 
release of multiple MEPP-like quanta. The 
observed match, including the predicted 
number of failures, supports this interpreta- 
tion. (After Boyd and Martin, 1955.) 
vesicle (~50 nm), approximately 10,000 molecules of 
neurotransmitter are contained in a single vesicle. This 
number corresponds quite nicely to the amount of ACh 
that must be applied to a neuromuscular junction to 
mimic a MEPP, providing further support for the idea 
that quanta arise from discharge of the contents of sin- 
gle synaptic vesicles. 
To prove that quanta are caused by the fusion of 
individual synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, 
it is necessary to show that each fused vesicle causes a 
single quantal event to be recorded postsynaptically. 
This challenge was met in the late 1970s, when John 
Heuser, Tom Reese, and colleagues correlated mea- 
surements of vesicle fusion with the quantal content of 
EPPs at the neuromuscular junction. They used elec- 
tron microscopy to determine the number of vesicles 
that fused with the presynaptic plasma membranes of 
terminals that had been treated with a drug (4-amino- 
pyridine, or 4-AP) that enhances the number of quanta 
released by single action potentials (Figure 5.8A). Par- 
allel electrical measurements were made of the quantal 
content of the EPPs elicited in this way. A comparison 
of the number of synaptic vesicle fusions observed with 
the electron microscope and the number of quanta re- 
leased at the synapse showed a good correlation be- 
tween these two measures (Figure 5.8B). These results 
remain one of the strongest lines of support for the idea 
that a quantum of transmitter release is due to fusion 
of a single synaptic vesicle with the presynaptic mem- 
brane. Subsequent evidence, based on other means 
of measuring vesicle fusion, has left no doubt about 
the validity of this general interpretation of chemi- 
cal synaptic transmission. Recent work has identified 
structures within the presynaptic terminal that connect 
vesicles to the plasma membrane and may be involved 
in membrane contact and/or fusion (Figure 5.8C). 
Local Recycling of Synaptic Vesicles 
The fusion of synaptic vesicles causes new membrane to 
be added to the plasma membrane of the presynaptic ter- 
minal, but the addition is not permanent. Although a bout 
of exocytosis can dramatically increase the surface area of 
presynaptic terminals, this extra membrane is removed 
within a few minutes. Heuser and Reese performed an- 
other important set of experiments showing that the fused 
vesicle membrane is actually retrieved and taken back into 
the cytoplasm of the nerve terminal (a process called en- 
docytosis). The experiments, again carried out at the frog 
neuromuscular junction, were based on filling the synaptic 
cleft with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), an enzyme that 
can be made to produce a dense reaction product that is vis- 
ible in an electron microscope. Under appropriate experi- - 
mental conditions, endocytosis could then be visualized by

the uptake of HRP into the nerve terminal (Figure 5.9). To 
activate endocytosis, the presynaptic terminal was stimu- 
lated with a train of action potentials, and the subsequent 
fate of the HRP was followed by electron microscopy. Im- 
mediately following stimulation, the HRP was found within 
special endocytotic organelles called coated vesicles (Figure 
5.9A,B). A few minutes later, however, the coated vesicles 
had disappeared, and the HRP was found in a different 
organelle, the endosome (Figure 5.9C). Finally, within an 
hour after stimulating the terminal, the HRP reaction prod- 
uct appeared inside synaptic vesicles (Figure 5.9D). 
These observations indicate that synaptic vesicle mem- 
brane is recycled within the presynaptic terminal via the 
sequence summarized in Figure 5.9E. In this process, called 
the synaptic vesicle cycle, the retrieved vesicular mem- 
brane passes through a number of intracellular compart- 
ments—such as coated vesicles and endosomes—and is 
eventually used to make new synaptic vesicles. After synap- 
tic vesicles are re-formed, they are stored in a reserve pool 
within the cytoplasm until they need to participate again 
in neurotransmitter release. These vesicles are mobilized 
lated presynaptic terminal. Right: Plasma membrane of a terminal stimulated by an 
action potential; stimulation causes the appearance of dimple-like structures that 
represent the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. The view 
in this image is as if looking down on the release sites from outside the presynaptic 
terminal. (B) Comparison of the number of observed vesicle fusions to the number of 
quanta released by a presynaptic action potential. Transmitter release was varied by 
using a drug (4-AP) that affects the duration of the presynaptic action potential, thus 
changing the amount of calcium that enters during the action potential. The diago- 
nal line is the 1:1 relationship expected if each vesicle that opened released a single 
quantum of transmitter. (C) Fine structure of vesicle fusion sites of frog presynaptic 
terminals. Synaptic vesicles are arranged in rows and are connected to each other 
and to the plasma membrane by a variety of proteinaceous structures (blue). The 
purple structures in the presynaptic membrane, corresponding to the rows of par- 
ticles seen in (A), are thought to be Ca?* channels. (A and B from Heuser et al., 1979; 
C after Harlow et al., 2001.) 
from the reserve pool, docked at the presynaptic plasma 
membrane, and primed to participate in exocytosis once 
again. More recent experiments, employing a fluorescent 
label rather than HRP, have determined the time course of 
synaptic vesicle recycling. These studies indicate that the 
entire vesicle cycle requires approximately 1 minute, with 
membrane budding during endocytosis requiring 10-20 
seconds of this time. As can be seen from the 1 millisecond 
delay in transmission following excitation of the presyn- 
aptic terminal (see Figure 5.6B), membrane fusion during 
exocytosis is much more rapid than budding during endo- 
cytosis. Thus, all of the recycling steps interspersed between 
membrane budding and subsequent refusion of a vesicle 
are completed in less than a minute. 
The precursors to synaptic vesicles originally are pro- 
duced in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus 
in the neuronal cell body. Because of the long distance be- 
tween the cell body and the presynaptic terminal in most 
neurons, transport of vesicles from the soma would not per- 
mit rapid replenishment of synaptic vesicles during con- 
tinuous neural activity. Thus, local recycling is well suited to

means to provide a continual supply of synaptic vesicles. 
The Role of Calcium 
in Transmitter Secretion 
As was apparent in the experiments of Katz and others 
described in the preceding sections, lowering the concen- 
tration of Ca** outside a presynaptic motor nerve termi- 
nal reduces the size of the EPP (compare Figures 5.6B and 
D). Moreover, measurement of the number of transmitter 
quanta released under such conditions shows that the rea- 
son the EPP gets smaller is that lowering Ca** concentration 
decreases the number of vesicles that fuse with the plasma 
membrane of the terminal. An important insight into how 
Ca** regulates the fusion of synaptic vesicles was the dis- 
covery that presynaptic terminals have voltage-gated Ca?* 
channels in their plasma membranes (see Chapter 4). 
The first indication of presynaptic Ca* channels was 
provided by Katz and Ricardo Miledi. They observed that 
presynaptic terminals treated with tetrodotoxin (which 
blocks voltage-gated Na* channels; see Chapter 3) could 
still produce a peculiarly prolonged type of action potential.

The explanation for this surprising finding was that cur- 
rent was still flowing through Ca** channels, substituting 
for the current ordinarily carried by the blocked Na* chan- 
nels. Subsequent voltage clamp experiments, performed by 
Rodolfo Llinas and others at a giant presynaptic terminal of 
the squid (Figure 5.10A), confirmed the presence of volt- 
age-gated Ca* channels in the presynaptic terminal (Figure 
5.10B). Such experiments showed that the amount of neu- 
rotransmitter released is very sensitive to the exact amount 
of Ca** that enters. Further, blockade of these Ca?* channels 
with drugs also inhibits transmitter release (Figure 5.10B, 
right). These observations all confirm that the voltage-gated 
Ca** channels are directly involved in neurotransmission. 
Thus, presynaptic action potentials open voltage-gated Ca?* 
channels, with a resulting influx of Ca?*. 
That Ca** entry into presynaptic terminals causes a rise 
in the concentration of Ca** within the terminal has been 
documented by microscopic imaging of terminals filled with 
Ca**-sensitive fluorescent dyes (Figure 5.11A). The:conse- 
quences of the rise in presynaptic Ca?* concentration for 
neurotransmitter release has been directly shown in two 
ways. First, microinjection of Ca** into presynaptic ter-

CHAPTER 5 
FIGURE 5.12 
Differential release of neuropep- 
tide and small-molecule co-transmitters. Low- 
frequency stimulation preferentially raises the Ca** 
concentration close to the membrane, favoring the 
release of transmitter from small clear-core vesicles 
docked at presynaptic specializations. High-frequency 
stimulation leads to a more general increase in Ca**, 
causing the release of peptide neurotransmitters from 
large dense-core vesicles, as well as small-molecule 
neurotransmitters from small clear-core vesicles. 
minals triggers transmitter release in the absence of presyn- 
aptic action potentials (Figure 5.11B). Second, presynaptic 
microinjection of calcium chelators (chemicals that bind 
Ca** and keep its concentration buffered at low levels) pre- 
vents presynaptic action potentials from causing transmitter 
secretion (Figure 5.11C). These results prove beyond any 
doubt that a rise in presynaptic Ca** concentration is both 
necessary and sufficient for neurotransmitter release. Thus, 
as is the case for many other forms of neuronal signaling 
(see Chapter 7), Ca'* serves as a second messenger during 
transmitter release. 
While Ca?* is a universal trigger for transmitter release, 
not all transmitters are released with the same speed. For 
example, while secretion of ACh from motor neurons re- 
quires only a fraction of a millisecond (see Figure 5.6), re- 
lease of neuropeptides requires high-frequency bursts of 
action potentials for many seconds. These differences in 
the rate of release probably arise from differences in the 
spatial arrangement of vesicles relative to presynaptic Ca** 
channels. This perhaps is most evident in cases where small 
molecules and peptides serve as co-transmitters (Figure 
5.12). Whereas the small clear-core vesicles containing 
small-molecule transmitters are typically docked at the 
plasma membrane in advance of Ca** entry, large dense- 
core vesicles containing peptide transmitters are farther 
away from the plasma membrane (see Figure 5.5D). At low 
firing frequencies, the concentration of Ca?* may increase 
only locally at the presynaptic plasma membrane, in the vi- 
cinity of open Ca** channels, limiting release to small-mole- 
cule transmitters from the docked small clear-core vesicles. 
Prolonged high-frequency stimulation increases the Ca? 
concentration throughout the presynaptic terminal, thereby 
inducing the slower release of neuropeptides.

Molecular Mechanisms 
of Synaptic Vesicle Cycling 
Precisely how an increase in presynaptic Ca?* concentration 
goes on to trigger vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter re- 
lease is not understood. However, many important insights 
have come from molecular studies that have identified and 
characterized the proteins found on synaptic vesicles (Fig- 
ure 5.13A) and their binding partners on the presynaptic 
plasma membrane and cytoplasm. Most, if not all, of these 
proteins act at one or more steps in the synaptic vesicle cy- 
cle. Although a complete molecular picture of neurotrans- 
mitter release is still lacking, the roles of several proteins in- 
volved in vesicle cycling have been deduced (Figure 5.13B). 
Several lines of evidence indicate that the protein synap- 
sin, which reversibly binds to synapti¢ vesicles, may keep 
these vesicles tethered within the reserve pool by cross- 
link vesicles to each other and to actin filaments in the 
cytoskeleton. Mobilization of these reserve pool vesicles 
is caused by phosphorylation of synapsin by proteins ki- 
nases, most notably the Ca**/calmodulin-dependent pro- 
tein kinase, type II (CaMKII; see Chapter 7), which allows 
synapsin to dissociate from the vesicles. Once vesicles are 
free from their reserve pool tethers, they make their way to 
the plasma membrane and are then attached to this mem- 
brane by poorly understood docking reactions. A series of 
priming reactions then prepares the vesicular and plasma

membranes for fusion. A large number of proteins are in- 
volved in priming, including some proteins that are also in- 
volved in other types of membrane fusion events common 
to all cells (see Figure 5.13B). For example, two proteins 
originally found to be important for the fusion of vesicles 
with membranes of the Golgi apparatus, the ATPase NSF 
(NEM-sensitive fusion protein) and SNAPs (soluble NSF- 
attachment proteins), are also involved in priming synaptic 
vesicles for fusion. These two proteins work by regulating 
the assembly of other proteins that are called SNAREs 
(SNAP receptors). Many of the other proteins involved in 
priming—such as munc-13, nSec-1, complexin, snapin, 
syntaphilin, and tomosyn—also interact with the SNAREs. 
One of the main purposes of priming seems to be to 
organize SNARE proteins into the correct conformation for 
membrane fusion. One of the SNARE proteins, synapto- 
brevin, is in the membrane of synaptic vesicles, while two 
other SNARE proteins called syntaxin and SNAP-25 are 
found primarily on the plasma membrane. These SNARE 
proteins can form a macromolecular complex that spans 
membrane fusion by binding to SNAREs 
and the plasma membrane 
ney 
SEE 
the two membranes, thus bringing therh into close appo- 
sition (Figure 5.14A). Such an arrangement is well suited 
to promote the fusion of the two membranes, and several 
lines of evidence suggest that this is what actually occurs. 
One important observation is that toxins that cleave the 
SNARE proteins block neurotransmitter release (Box 5B). In 
addition, putting SNARE proteins into artificial lipid mem- 
branes and allowing these proteins to form complexes with 
each other causes the membranes to fuse. 
Because the SNARE proteins do not bind Ca?*, still 
other molecules must be responsible for Ca?* regulation 
of neurotransmitter release. Several presynaptic proteins, 

BOX 5B Diseases That Affect the Presynaptic Terminal 
_ Defects in various steps in the exocyto- 
_ sis and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles 
_ have been shown to be at the root of a 
| number of rare but debilitating neuro- 
logical diseases. 
Myasthenic syndromes 
In myasthenic syndromes, abnormal 
transmission at neuromuscular synapses 
leads to weakness and fatigability of 
skeletal muscles (see Box 7B). One of 
the best understood examples of these 
disorders is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic 
syndrome, or LEMS, an occasional com- 
plication in patients with certain kinds 
of cancers. Biopsies of muscle tissue 
removed from LEMS patients allow 
intracellular recordings identical to those 
in Figure 5.6. These recordings from 
affected tissues show that when a motor 
neuron is stimulated, the number of 
quanta contained in individual EPPs is 
greatly reduced although the amplitude 
of spontaneous MEPPs is normal. Thus, 
LEMS impairs evoked neurotransmit- 
ter release but does not affect the size 
of individual quanta. Several lines of 
evidence indicate that this reduction in 
neurotransmitter release is due to a loss 
of voltage-gated Ca** channels in the 
presynaptic terminal of motor neurons 
_ 
(see Figure A); perhaps most compelling 
are anatomical studies that reveal a low- 
ered density of Ca** channel proteins in 
the presynaptic plasma membrane. 
The loss of presynaptic Ca** channels 
in LEMS patients apparently arises from 
an autoimmune disorder. Their blood 
has a very high concentration of anti- 
bodies that bind to Ca** channels, and it 
seems likely that these antibodies are the 
primary cause of LEMS. For example, 
removal of Ca* channel antibodies from 
the blood of LEMS patients by plasma 
exchange reduces muscle weakness. 
Similarly, immunosuppressant drugs 
also can alleviate LEMS symptoms. 
_ Perhaps most telling, injecting these 
antibodies into experimental animals 
elicits muscle weakness and abnormal 
neuromuscular transmission. Why the 
immune system generates antibod- 
ies against Ca** channels is not clear. 
Most LEMS patients have small-cell 
carcinoma, a form of lung cancer that 
may somehow initiate the immune 
response to Ca** channels. Whatever 
the origin, the binding of antibodies to 
Ca** channels causes a reduction in Ca?* 
channel currents. It is this antibody- 
induced defect in presynaptic Ca"* entry 
that accounts for the muscle weakness 
associated with LEMS. 
Congenital myasthenic syndromes are 
genetic disorders that, like LEMS, cause 
muscle weakness by affecting neuro- 
muscular transmission. Some of these 
syndromes affect the acetylcholinesterase 
that degrades acetylcholine in the synap- 
tic cleft, whereas others arise from auto- 
immune attack of acetylcholine receptors 
(see Box 6B). However, a number of con- 
genital myasthenic syndromes arise from 
defects in acetylcholine release from the 
motor neuron terminal. Neuromuscular 
synapses in some of these patients have 
EPPs with reduced quantal content, 
a deficit that is especially prominent 
when the synapse is activated repeat- 
edly. Electron microscopy shows that 
presynaptic motor nerve terminals have 
a greatly reduced number of synaptic 
vesicles. The defect in neu- 
rotransmitter release evidently 
results from an inadequate 
number of synaptic vesicles 
available for release during 
sustained presynaptic activity. 
The origins of this shortage of 
synaptic vesicles is not clear, 
but could result either from an 
impairment in endocytosis in 
the nerve terminal (see Figure 
(A) The presynaptic targets

pathologies.

A) or from a reduced supply of vesicles 
components from the motor neuron cell 
body. 
Still other patients suffering from 
familial infantile myasthenia appear to 
have neuromuscular weakness that 
arises from reductions in the size of 
individual quanta rather than the num- 
ber of quanta released. Motor nerve ter- 
minals from these patients have synap- 
tic vesicles that are normal in number, 
but smaller than normal in diameter. 
This finding suggests a different type 
of genetic lesion that somehow alters 
formation of new synaptic vesicles 
following endocytosis, leading to less 
acetylcholine in each vesicle. 
Botulism and tetanus 
Impairment of synaptic transmitter 
release also results from poisoning by 
anaerobic Clostridium bacteria. This 
genus of microorganisms produces 
some of the most potent toxins known, 
including several botulinum toxins and 
tetanus toxin. Both botulism and teta- 
nus are potentially deadly disorders.

BOX 5B (continued) 
___ 
Botulism can occur by consuming 
_ food containing Clostridium bacteria, 
_ or by infection of wounds with the 
_ spores of these ubiquitous organisms. 
In either case, the presence of the toxin 
can cause paralysis of peripheral neu- 
romuscular synapses due to impaired 
neurotransmitter release. This interfer- 
ence with neuromuscular transmission 
- causes skeletal muscle weakness; in 
_ extreme cases respiratory failure results 
_ from paralysis of the diaphragm and 
_ other muscles required for breathing. 
_ Botulinum toxins also block synapses 
_ innervating the smooth muscles of sev- 
eral organs, giving rise to visceral motor 
_ dysfunction. 
Tetanus typically results from the 
- contamination of puncture wounds 
_ by Clostridium bacteria that produce 
' tetanus toxin. In contrast to botulism, 
_ tetanus poisoning blocks the release 
_ of inhibitory transmitters from inter- 
_ neurons in the spinal cord. This effect 
_ causes a loss of synaptic inhibition on 
_ spinal motor neurons, producing hyper- 
excitation of skeletal muscle and tetanic 
contractions in affected muscles (hence 
_ the name of the disease). 
_ 
Although their clinical consequences 
are dramatically different, clever and 
patient biochemical work has shown 
_ that clostridial toxins actually have a 
_ common mechanism of action: they are 
_ highly specific proteases that inhibit 
_ neurotransmitter release by cleaving the 
SNARE proteins involved in fusion of 
synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic 
plasma membrane (Figure B). Tetanus 
toxin and botulinum toxin types B, D, 
F, and G specifically cleave the vesicle 
SNARE protein synaptobrevin. Other 
botulinum toxins cleave syntaxin (type 
C) and SNAP-25 (types A and E), 
SNARE proteins found on the presyn- 
aptic plasma membrane. Destruction of 
these presynaptic proteins is the basis 
for the inhibitory actions of clostridial 
toxins on neurotransmitter release. 
(B) Cleavage of SNARE proteins by clostridial toxins. 
Indicated are the sites of proteolysis by tetanus toxin 
(TeTX) and various types of botulinum toxin (BoTX). 
(After Sutton et al., 1998.) 
The different actions of these toxins 
on synaptic transmission at excitatory 
motor versus inhibitory synapses appar- 
ently results from the fact that these 
toxins are taken up by different types of 
neurons: whereas the botulinum toxins 
are taken up by motor neurons, tetanus 
toxin is preferentially targeted to inter- 
neurons. The differential uptake of tox- 
ins presumably arises from the presence 
of different types of toxin receptors on 
the two types of neurons. 
Insights from a-latrotoxin 
Latrodectism refers to the severe muscle 
pain and cramping experienced by 
patients bitten by the black widow 
spider, Latrodectus. These symptoms 
arise from the presynaptic neurotoxin 
a-latrotoxin, present in black widow 
spider venom; this toxin causes a mas- 
sive discharge of neurotransmitter from 
presynaptic terminals. Although neu- 
rotransmitter release ordinarily requires 
Ca**, a-latrotoxin is capable of releas- 
ing neurotransmitter even when Ca** 
absent from the extracellular medium. 
Although it is not yet clear how the 
toxin triggers Ca**-independent exocy- 
tosis, we know that a-latrotoxin binds 
Synaptic vesicle 
membrane 
Syntaxin 
to two different types of presynaptic 
proteins that may mediate its actions. 
One group of binding partners for 
a-latrotoxin is the neurexins, a group 
of integral membrane proteins found 
in presynaptic terminals. 
Neurexins 
bind to synaptotagmin, the presynaptic 
Ca* sensor, and this interaction may 
allow a-latrotoxin to bypass the usual 
Ca"* requirement for triggering vesicle 
fusion. Another type of presynaptic 
protein that can bind to a-latrotoxin is 
called CL1 (based on its previous names, 
Ca?*-independent receptor for latrotoxin 
and latrophilin-1). CL1 is a relative of 
the G-protein-coupled receptors that 
mediate the actions of neurotransmitters 
and other extracellular chemical signals 
(see Chapter 7). Thus, the binding of 
a-latrotoxin to CL1 could activate an 
intracellular signal transduction cas- 
cade involved in the Ca**-independent 
actions of a-latrotoxin. While more work 
is needed to establish the definitive roles 
of neurexins and CL1 in a-latrotoxin 
action, these two proteins are probably 
the basis for the toxin's potent presynap- 
tic activity. 
In addition to their possible role 
in latrodectism, neurexins have been

_ ders. Mutations in the neurexin gene 
_ have been identified in a number of 
_ patients suffering from schizophrenia, 
_ 
a psychiatric disease causing delusions, 
, 
_ hallucinations and loss of emotional 
expression (see Box 18D). Neurexins 
_ are known to play an important role 
_ in signaling across the synaptic cleft 
_ by binding to a family of postsynaptic

_ Remarkably, mutations in neuroligins 
_ also have been associated with autism, 
a spectrum of psychiatric disorders 
characterized by impaired social inter- 
action, communication problems, and 
_ other behavioral disorders. While a 
direct connection between neurexins/ 
' neuroligins and these psychiatric dis- 
orders has not yet been established, it 
seems likely that defects in these trans- 
synaptic signaling partners may serve 
as a central mechanism underlying a 
number of behavioral disorders. 
In summary, not only does research 
into synaptic vesicle trafficking illumi- 
nate the causes of certain neurological 
and psychiatric disorders, but research 
into these diseases in turn has provided 
tools—such as clostridial toxins and 
a.-latrotoxin—that have proven valuable 
in elucidating the basic mechanisms of 
synaptic vesicle trafficking.

including calmodulin, CAPS, and munc-13, are capable 
of binding Ca?*. However, it appears that Ca** regulation 
of neurotransmitter release is conferred by synaptotag- 
min, a protein found in the membrane of synaptic vesicles 
(see Figure 5.14A). Synaptotagmin binds Ca** at concen- 
trations similar to those required to trigger vesicle fusion 
within the presynaptic terminal, and this property allows 
synaptotagmin to act as a Ca** sensor, signaling the eleva- 
tion of Ca?* within the terminal and thus triggering vesicle 
fusion. In support of this idea, disruption of synaptotag- 
min in the presynaptic terminals of mice, fruit flies, squid, 
and other experimental animals impairs Ca**-dependent 
neurotransmitter release. In fact, deletion of only one of 
the 19 synaptotagmin genes of mice is a lethal mutation, 
causing the mice to die soon after birth. How Ca** binding 
to synaptotagmin leads to exocytosis is not yet clear. It is 
known that Ca?* changes the chemical properties of synap- 
totagmin, allowing it to insert into membranes and to bind 
to SNARE proteins. A plausible model is that the SNARE 
proteins bring the two membranes close together, and that 
Ca?*-induced changes in synaptotagmin then produce the 
final fusion of these membranes (Figure 5.14B). 
Still other proteins appear to be involved at the endo- 
cytosis steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle (Figure 5.15). The 
most important protein involved in endocytotic budding of 
vesicles from the plasma membrane is clathrin. Clathrin 
has a unique structure that is called a triskelion because of 
Clin. Immunol. 30 (Suppl. 1): S97-S102. 
its three-legged appearance (Figure 5.15A). During endo- 
cytosis, clathrin triskelia attach to the vesicular membrane 
that is to be retrieved (Figure 5.15B). A number of adap- 
tor proteins, such as AP-2 and AP180, connect clathrin to 
the proteins and lipids of this membrane. These adaptor 
proteins, as well as other proteins such as amphiphysin, 
epsin, and Eps-15, help to assemble individual triskelia 
into structures that resemble geodesic domes (see Figure 
5.15A). Such dome-like structures form coated pits that 
initiate membrane budding, increasing the curvature of 
the budding membrane until it forms a coated vesicle-like 
structure. Another protein, called dynamin, causes the final 
pinching-off of membrane that completes the production 
of coated vesicles. The clathrin coats then are removed by 
an ATPase, Hsc70, with another protein, auxilin, serv- 
ing as a co-factor that recruits Hsc70 to the coated vesicle. 
Other proteins, such as synaptojanin, are also important 
for vesicle uncoating. Uncoated vesicles can then continue 
their journey through the recycling process, eventually be- 
coming refilled with neurotransmitter due to the actions 
of neurotransmitter transporters in the vesicle membrane. 
These transporters exchange protons within the vesicle for 
neurotransmitter; the acidic interior of the vesicle is pro- 
duced by a proton pump that also is located in the vesicle 
membrane. 
In summary, a complex cascade of proteins, acting in 
a defined temporal and spatial order, allows neurons to

secrete transmitters. Although the molecular mechanisms 
responsible for transmitter secretion are not entirely clear, 
most of the proteins involved in this process now have been 
identified. 
Neurotransmitter Receptors 
The generation of postsynaptic electrical signals is also un- 
derstood in considerable depth. Such studies began in 1907, 
when the British physiologist John N. Langley introduced 
the concept of receptor molecules to explain the specific 
and potent actions of certain chemicals on muscle and 
nerve cells. We now know that neurotransmitter receptors 
are proteins that are embedded in the plasma membrane of 
postsynaptic cells and have an extracellular neurotransmit- 
ter binding site that detects the presence of neurotransmit- 
ters in the synaptic cleft. 
There are two broad families of receptor proteins that 
differ in their mechanism of transducing transmitter bind- 
ing into postsynaptic responses. The receptors in one family 
contain a membrane-spanning domain that forms an ion 
channel (Figure 5.16A). These receptors combine transmit- 
ter-binding and channel functions into a single molecular 
entity and thus are called ionotropic receptors (the Greek 
tropos means to move in response to a stimulus) or ligand- 
gated ion channels. 
The second family of neurotransmitter receptors are 
metabotropic receptors, so called because the even- 
tual movement of ions through a channel depends on

the vesicular membrane. Adaptor proteins, such as AP-2 and AP180, aid their 
attachment. Polymerization of clathrin causes the membrane to curve, allowing 
dynamin to pinch off the coated vesicle. Subsequent uncoating of the vesicle, by 
Hsc-70 and auxilin, yields a synaptic vesicle. (A after Marsh and McMahon, 1999.)

intervening metabolic steps. These receptors do not have 
ion channels as part of their structure; instead, they have an 
intracellular domain that indirectly affects channels though 
the activation of intermediate molecules called G-proteins 
(Figure 5.16B). Neurotransmitter binding to these recep- 
tors activates G-proteins, which then dissociate from the 
receptor and interact directly with ion channels or bind to 
other effector proteins, such as enzymes, that make intra- 
cellular messengers that open or close ion channels. Thus, 
G-proteins can be thought of as transducers that couple 
neurotransmitter binding to the regulation of postsynaptic 
ion channels. For this reason, metabotropic receptors are 
also called G-protein-coupled receptors. The postsynap- 
tic signaling events initiated by metabotropic receptors are 
taken up in detail in Chapter 7. 
These two families of postsynaptic receptors give rise to 
postsynaptic actions that range from less than a millisecond 
to minutes, hours, or even days. Ionotropic receptors gen- 
erally mediate rapid postsynaptic effects. Examples are the 
EPP produced at neuromuscular synapses by ACh (see Fig- 
ure 5.6B), as well as the postsynaptic responses produced 
at certain glutamatergic synapses and GABAergic synapses 
(see Figure 5.21B). In these cases, the PSPs arise within a 
millisecond or two of an action potential invading the pre- 
synaptic terminal and last for only a few tens of millisec- 
onds or less. In contrast, the activation of metabotropic re- 
ceptors typically produces much slower responses, ranging 
from hundreds of milliseconds to minutes or even longer,

reflects the fact that multiple proteins need to bind to each 
other sequentially in order to produce the final physiologi- 
cal response. Importantly, a given transmitter may activate 
both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors to produce 
both fast and slow PSPs at the same synapse. 
Postsynaptic Membrane 
Permeability Changes during 
Synaptic Transmission 
Just as studies of the neuromuscular synapse paved the way 
for understanding neurotransmitter release mechanisms, 
this peripheral synapse has been equally valuable for un- 
derstanding the mechanisms that allow neurotransmitter 
receptors to generate postsynaptic signals. The binding of 
ACh to postsynaptic receptors opens ion channels in the 
muscle fiber membrane. This effect can be demonstrated 
directly by using the patch clamp method (see Box 4A) to 
measure the minute postsynaptic currents that flow when 
two molecules of individual ACh bind to receptors, as Erwin 
Neher and Bert Sakmann first did in 1976. Exposure of the 
extracellular surface of a patch of postsynaptic membrane

to ACh causes single-channel currents to flow for a few 
milliseconds (Figure 5.17A). This shows that ACh binding 
to its receptors opens ligand-gated ion channels, much in 
the way that changes in membrane potential open voltage- 
gated ion channels (see Chapter 4). 
The electrical actions of ACh are greatly multiplied when 
an action potential in a presynaptic motor neuron causes 
the release of millions of molecules of ACh into the synaptic 
cleft. In this more physiological case, the transmitter mol- 
ecules bind to many thousands of ACh receptors packed in 
a dense array on the postsynaptic membrane, transiently 
opening a very large number of postsynaptic ion channels. 
Although individual ACh receptors only open briefly (Fig- 
ure 5.17B1), the opening of a large number of channels is 
synchronized by the brief duration during which ACh is 
secreted from presynaptic terminals (Figure 5.17B2,3). The 
macroscopic current resulting from the summed opening of 
many ion channels is called the end plate current, or EPC. 
Because the current flowing during the EPC is normally 
inward, it causes the postsynaptic membrane potential to 
depolarize. This depolarizing change in potential is the EPP 
(Figure 5.17C), which typically triggers a postsynaptic ac- 
tion potential by opening voltage-gated Na* and K* chan- 
nels (see Figure 5.6B). 
The identity of the ions that flow during the EPC can 
be determined via the same approaches used to identify 
the roles of Na* and K* fluxes in the currents underlying 
action potentials (see Chapter 3). Key to such an analysis 
is identifying the membrane potential at which no current 
flows during transmitter action. When the potential of the

extracellular surface of the membrane clamped at negative volt- 
ages, the repeated brief opening of a single channel can be seen 
as downward deflections corresponding to inward current (i.e., 
positive ions flowing into the cell). (B) Synchronized opening 
of many ACh-activated channels at a synapse being voltage- 
clamped at negative voltages. (1) If a single channel is examined 
during the release of ACh from the presynaptic terminal, the 
channel opens transiently. (2) If a number of channels are exam- 
ined together, ACh release opens the channels almost synchro- 
nously. (3) The opening of a very large number of postsynaptic 
channels produces a macroscopic EPC. (C) In 
anormal muscle 
cell (i.e., not being voltage-clamped), the inward EPC depolarizes 
the postsynaptic muscle cell, giving rise to an EPP. Typically, this 
depolarization generates an action potential (not shown). 
postsynaptic muscle cell is controlled by the voltage clamp 
method (Figure 5.18A), the magnitude of the membrane 
potential clearly affects the amplitude and polarity of EPCs 
(Figure 5.18B). Thus, when the postsynaptic membrane 
potential is made more negative than the resting poten- 
tial, the amplitude of the EPC becomes larger, whereas this 
current is reduced when the membrane potential is made 
more positive. At approximately 0 mV, no EPC is detected, 
and at even more positive potentials, the current reverses 
its polarity, becoming outward rather than inward (Figure 
5.18C). The potential where the EPC reverses, about 0 mV 
in the case of the neuromuscular junction, is called the re- 
versal potential. 
As was the case for currents flowing through voltage- 
gated ion channels (see Chapter 3), the magnitude of the 
EPC at any membrane potential is given by the product 
of the ionic conductance activated by ACh (g,..) and the 
electrochemical driving force on the ions flowing through

where E_. is the reversal potential for the EPC. This rela- 
tionship predicts that the EPC will be an inward current 
at potentials more negative than E.. because the electro- 
chemical driving force, V_—E_., is a negative number. Fur- 
ther, the EPC will become smaller at potentials approach- 
ing E_,, because the driving force is reduced. At potentials 
more positive than E_., the EPC is outward because the 
driving force is reversed in direction (that is, positive). Be- 
cause the channels opened by ACh are largely insensitive 
to membrane voltage, g,.,, will depend only on the number 
of channels opened by ACh, which depends in turn on the 
concentration of ACh in the synaptic cleft. Thus, the mag- 
nitude and polarity of the postsynaptic membrane potential 
determines the direction and amplitude of the EPC solely 
by altering the driving force on ions flowing through the 
receptor channels opened by ACh. 
When V, is at the reversal potential, V.—E_. is equal to 0 
and there is no net driving force on the ions that can perme- 
ate the receptor-activated channel. As a result, the identity - 
of the ions that flow during the EPC can be deduced by 

observing how the reversal potential of the EPC compares 
with the equilibrium potential for various ion species (Fig- 
ure 5.18D). For example, if ACh were to open an ion chan- 
nel permeable only to K*, then the reversal potential of the 
EPC would be at the equilibrium potential for K*, which 
for a muscle cell is close to -100 mV. If the ACh-activated 
channels were permeable only to Na', then the reversal 
potential of the current would be approximately +70 mV, 
the Na* equilibrium potential of muscle cells; if these chan- 
nels were permeable only to Cl, then the reversal potential 
would be approximately —50 mV. By this reasoning, ACh- 
activated channels cannot be permeable to only one of

these ions, because the reversal potential of the EPC is not 
near the equilibrium potential for any of them (see Figure 
5.18C). However, if these channels were permeable to both 
Na* and K*, then the reversal potential of the EPC would be 
between +70 mV and -100 mV.

Postsynaptic membrane potential (mV) 
The fact that EPCs reverse at approximately 0 mV is there- 
fore consistent with the idea that ACh-activated ion chan- 
nels are almost equally permeable to both Na* and K*. This 
was tested in 1960, by the Japanese husband and wife team 
of Akira and Noriko Takeuchi, by altering the extracellular 
concentration of these two ions. As predicted, the magnitude 
and reversal potential of the EPC was changed by altering the 
concentration gradient of each ion. Lowering the external 
Na* concentration, which makes E., more negative, pro- 
duces a negative shift in E, (Figure 5.19A), whereas elevat- 
ing external K* concentration, which makes E, more positive, 
causes E_., to shift to a more positive potential (Figure 5.19B). 
Such experiments confirm that the ACh-activated ion chan- 
nels are in fact permeable to both Na* and K*. 
Even though the channels opened by the binding of 
ACh to its receptors are permeable to both Na* and K', 
at the resting membrane potential the EPC is generated 
primarily by Na* influx (Figure 5.20). If the membrane po- 
tential is kept at E,, the EPC arises entirely from an influx 
of Na* because at this potential there is no driving force on 
K* (Figure 5.20A). At the usual muscle fiber resting mem- 
brane potential of -90 mV, there is a small driving force on 
K*, but a much greater one on Na'. Thus, during the EPC, 
much more Na* flows into the muscle cell than K* flows 
out (Figure 5.20B); it is the net influx of positively charged 
Na* that constitutes the inward current measured as the 
EPC. At the reversal potential of about 0 mV, Na* influx and 
K* efflux are exactly balanced, so no current flows during 
the opening of channels by ACh binding (Figure 5.20C). At 
potentials more positive than E,, the balance reverses; for 
example, at E., there is no influx of Na* and a large efflux of 
K* because of the large driving force on K* (Figure 5.20D). 
Even more positive potentials cause efflux of both Nat and 
K* and produce an even larger outward EPC. 
Were it possible to measure the EPP at the same time 
as the EPC (of course, the voltage clamp technique pre- 
vents this by keeping membrane potential constant), the 
EPP would be seen to vary in parallel with the amplitude 
and polarity of the EPC (Figures 5.20E,F). At the usual

postsynaptic resting membrane potential of -90 mV, the 
large inward EPC causes the postsynaptic membrane po- 
tential to become more depolarized (see Figure 5.20F). 
However, at 0 mV, the EPP reverses its polarity, and at more 
positive potentials, the EPP is hyperpolarizing. Thus, the 
polarity and magnitude of the EPC depend on the electro- 
chemical driving force, which in turn determines the polar- 
ity and magnitude of the EPP. EPPs will depolarize when 
the membrane potential is more negative than E.., and 
hyperpolarize when the membrane potential is more posi- 
tive than E.,. The general rule, then, is that the action of a 
transmitter drives the postsynaptic membrane potential toward 
E_., for the particular ion channels being activated. 
Although this discussion has focused on the neuromus- 
cular junction, similar mechanisms generate postsynaptic 
responses at all chemical synapses. The general principle 
is that transmitter binding to postsynaptic receptors pro- 
duces a postsynaptic conductance change as ion channels 
are opened (or sometimes closed). The postsynaptic con- 
ductance is increased if—as at the neuromuscular junc- 
tion—channels are opened, and decreased if channels are 
closed. This conductance change typically generates an 
electrical current, the postsynaptic current (PSC), which 
in turn changes the postsynaptic membrane potential to 
produce a postsynaptic potential (PSP). As in the specific 
case of the EPP at the neuromuscular junction, PSPs are 
depolarizing if their reversal potential is more positive than 
the postsynaptic membrane potential and hyperpolarizing 
if their reversal potential is more negative. 
The conductance changes and the PSPs that typically ac- 
company them are the ultimate outcome of most chemical 
synaptic transmission, concluding a sequence of electrical 
and chemical events that begins with the invasion of an ac- 
tion potential into the terminals of a presynaptic neuron. In 
many ways, the events that produce PSPs at synapses are 
similar to those that generate action potentials in axons; in 
both cases, conductance changes produced by ion chan- 
nels lead to ionic current flow that changes the membrane 
potential.

104 
Excitatory and Inhibitory 
Postsynaptic Potentials 
PSPs ultimately alter the probability that 
an action potential will be produced in 
the postsynaptic cell. At the neuromus- 
cular junction, synaptic action increases 
the probability that an action potential 
will occur in the postsynaptic muscle cell; 
indeed, the large amplitude of the EPP 
ensures that an action potential always is 
triggered. At many other synapses, PSPs 
similarly increase the probability of firing 
a postsynaptic action potential. However, 
still other synapses actually decrease the 
probability that the postsynaptic cell will 
generate an action potential.. PSPs are 
called excitatory (or EPSPs) if they in- 
crease the likelihood of a postsynaptic ac- 
tion potential occurring, and inhibitory 
(or IPSPs) if they decrease this likelihood. 
Given that most neurons receive inputs 
from both excitatory and inhibitory syn- 
apses, it is important to understand more 
precisely the mechanisms that determine 
whether a particular synapse excites or 
inhibits its postsynaptic partner. 
The principles of excitation just de- 
scribed for the neuromuscular junction 
are pertinent to all excitatory synapses. 
The principles of postsynaptic inhibition 
are much the same as for excitation, and 
they are also quite general. In both cases, 
neurotransmitters binding to receptors 
open or close ion channels in the post- 
synaptic cell. Whether a postsynaptic re- 
sponse is an EPSP or an IPSP depends 
on the type of channel that is coupled to 
the receptor, and on the concentration of 
permeant ions inside and outside the cell. 
In fact, the only distinction between post- 
synaptic excitation and inhibition is the 
reversal potential of the PSP in relation 
to the threshold voltage for generating 
action petentials in the postsynaptic cell. 
Consider, for example, a neuronal syn- 
apse that uses glutamate as the transmit- 
ter. Many such synapses have receptors 
that, like the ACh receptors at neuromus- 
cular synapses, open ion channels that 
are nonselectively permeable to cations 
(see Chapter 6). When these glutamate 
receptors are activated, both Na* and K* 
flow across the postsynaptic membrane,

yielding an E,, of approximately 0 mV for the resulting 
postsynaptic current. If the resting potential of the postsyn- 
aptic neuron is -60 mV, the resulting EPSP will depolarize 
by bringing the postsynaptic membrane potential toward 
0 mV. For the hypothetical neuron shown in Figure 5.21A, 
the action potential threshold voltage is -40 mV. Thus, a 
glutamate-induced EPSP will increase the probability that 
this neuron produces an action potential, defining the syn- 
apse as excitatory. 
As an example of inhibitory postsynaptic action, con- 
sider a neuronal synapse that uses GABA as its transmit- 
ter. At such synapses, the GABA receptors typically open 
channels that are selectively permeable to Cl, and the 
action of GABA causes CI to flow across the postsynap- 
tic membrane. Consider a case where E,, is -70 mV, as is 
the case for some neurons, so that the postsynaptic resting 
potential of -60 mV is less negative than E,,. The resulting 
positive electrochemical driving force (V,, — E.,,) will cause 
negatively charged Cl to flow into the cell and produce a 
hyperpolarizing IPSP (Figure 5.21B). This hyperpolarizing 
IPSP will take the postsynaptic membrane away from the 
action potential threshold of —40 mV, clearly inhibiting the 
postsynaptic cell. 
Surprisingly, inhibitory synapses need not produce hy- 
perpolarizing IPSPs. For instance, if E,, were -50 mV in- 
stead of -70 mV, then the negative electrochemical driving 
force would cause CI to flow out of the cell and produce 
a depolarizing IPSP (Figure 5.21C). However, the synapse 
would still be inhibitory: given that the reversal potential 
of the IPSP still is more negative than the action potential 
threshold (-40 mV), the depolarizing IPSP would inhibit 
because the postsynaptic membrane potential would be 
kept more negative than the threshold for action potential 
initiation. Another way to think about this peculiar situation 
is that if another excitatory input onto this neuron brought 
the cell's membrane potential to -41 mV—just below the 
threshold for firing an action potential—the IPSP would 
then hyperpolarize the membrane potential toward -50

Reversal potentials and threshold potentials

is excitatory, and it generates EPSPs. (B) If the reversal potential

threshold. Thus, while EPSPs depolarize the postsynaptic 
cell, IPSPs can either hyperpolarize or depolarize; indeed, 
an inhibitory conductance change may produce no poten- 
tial change at all and still exert an inhibitory effect by mak- 
ing it more difficult for an EPSP to evoke an action potential 
in the postsynaptic cell. 
Although the particulars of postsynaptic action can be 
complex, a simple rule distinguishes postsynaptic excitation 
from inhibition: An EPSP has a reversal potential more pos- 
itive than the action potential threshold, whereas an IPSP 
has a reversal potential more negative than threshold (Fig- 
ure 5.21D). Intuitively, this rule can be understood by real- 
izing that an EPSP will tend to depolarize the membrane 
potential so that it exceeds threshold, whereas an IPSP will 
always act to keep the membrane potential more negative 
than the threshold potential. 
Summation of Synaptic Potentials 
The PSPs produced at most synapses in the brain are much 
smaller than those at the neuromuscular junction; indeed, 
EPSPs produced by individual excitatory synapses may be-_

threshold for generating postsynaptic action potentials. 
How, then, can such synapses transmit information if their 
PSPs are subthreshold? The answer is that neurons in the 
central nervous system are typically innervated by thou- 
sands of synapses, and the PSPs produced by each active 
synapse can sum together—in space and in time—to deter- 
mine the behavior of the postsynaptic neuron. 
Consider the highly simplified case of a neuron that is 
innervated by two excitatory synapses, each generating a 
subthreshold EPSP, and an inhibitory synapse that produces 
an IPSP (Figure 5.22A). While activation of either one of the 
excitatory synapses alone (E1 or E2 in Figure 5.22B) produces 
a subthreshold EPSP, activation of both excitatory synapses 
at about the same time causes the two EPSPs to sum to- 
gether. If the sum of the two EPSPs (E1 + E2) depolarizes 
the postsynaptic neuron sufficiently to reach the threshold 
potential, a postsynaptic action potential results. Summa- 
tion thus allows subthreshold EPSPs to influence action 
potential production. Likewise, an IPSP generated by an

Summation of postsynaptic potentials. (A) 
A microelectrode records the postsynaptic potentials produced 
by the activity of two excitatory synapses (E1 and E2) and an 
inhibitory synapse (1). (B) Electrical responses to synaptic activa- 
tion. Stimulating either excitatory synapse (E1 or E2) produces 
a subthreshold EPSP, whereas stimulating both synapses at the 
same time (E1 + E2) produces a suprathreshold EPSP that evokes 
a postsynaptic action potential (shown in blue). Activation of 
the inhibitory synapse alone (I) results in a hyperpolarizing IPSP. 
Summing this IPSP (dashed red line) with the EPSP (dashed yel- 
low line) produced by one excitatory synapse (E1 + |) reduces the 
amplitude of the EPSP (orange line), while summing it with the 
suprathreshold EPSP produced by activating synapses E1 and 
E2 keeps the postsynaptic neuron below threshold, so that no 
action potential is evoked. 
Summed

(Synapses

inhibitory synapse (I) can sum (algebraically speaking) with 
a subthreshold EPSP to reduce its amplitude (E1 + I) or can 
sum with suprathreshold EPSPs to prevent the postsynaptic 
neuron from reaching threshold (E1 + I+ E2). 
In short, the summation of EPSPs and IPSPs by a post- 
synaptic neuron permits a neuron to integrate the electrical 
information provided by all the inhibitory and excitatory 
synapses acting on it at any moment. Whether the sum of 
active synaptic inputs results in the production of an action 
potential depends on the balance between excitation and 
inhibition. If the sum of all EPSPs and IPSPs results in a de- 
polarization of sufficient amplitude to raise the membrane 
potential above threshold, then the postsynaptic cell will 
produce an action potential. Conversely, if inhibition pre- 
vails, then the postsynaptic cell will remain silent. Normally, 
the balance between EPSPs and IPSPs changes continually 
over time, depending on the number of excitatory and in- 
hibitory synapses active at a given moment and the mag- 
nitude of the current at each active synapse. Summation is

CHAPTER 5 
BOX 5C The "Tripartite Synapse" 
_ Up to this point, our discussion has 
considered signaling between presyn- 
- aptic neurons and their postsynaptic 
_ targets to be a private dialogue between 
_ these two cells. However, recent work 
_ suggests that this synaptic conversation 
_ may involve glial cells as well. 
_ 
As mentioned in Chapter 1, glial 
_ cells support neurons in a number of 
ways. For example, it is well established 
_ that glia regulate the extracellular envi- 
ronment by removing K* that accumu- 
_ lates during action potential generation 
and by removing neurotransmitters at 
the conclusion of synaptic transmission. 
_ Consistent with such roles, glia seem to 
occupy virtually all of the non-neuronal 
- volume of the brain. As a result of this 
arrangement, glia are found in very 
(A) Electron microscopy image of a synapse 
between a presynaptic terminal (pre) and 
postsynaptic neuron (post), with a glial cell 
(astrocyte; astro) immediately adjacent to 
the synapse. (B) Three-dimensional struc- 
ture of the contact between a glial cell 
(blue) surrounding dendrites of four post- 
synaptic neurons (different colors). (From 
Witcher et al., 2007.) 
(A) 
close association with synapses (Figure 
A); a given synapse typically is no more 
than a fraction of a micrometer away 
from a glial cell. Glia form exceedingly 
fine processes that completely envelop 
synapses (Figure B), an intimate asso- 
ciation that raises the possibility of a 
signaling role for glia at synapses. 
The first support for such a role 
came from the discovery that glia cells 
respond to application of neurotrans- 
mitters. The list of neurotransmit- 
ters that elicit responses in glia now 
includes acetylcholine, glutamate, 
GABA, and many others. These 
responses are mediated by the same 
sorts of neurotransmitter receptors that 
are employed in synaptic signaling, 
most often the metabotropic receptors 
that are coupled to intracellular sig- 
naling cascades (see Figure 5.16B). In 
some cases, neurotransmitters produce 
changes in the membrane potential 
of glial cells. More often, these neu- 
rotransmitters cause transient changes 
in intracellular calcium concentration 
within the glial cell. These intracellular 
calcium signals often are observed to 
trigger calcium waves that spread both 
within a single glial cell and also propa- 
gate between glial cells (Figure C).

These transient rises in intracellu- 
lar calcium serve as second messenger 
signals (see Chapter 7) that trigger a 
number of physiological responses in 
glia. The most remarkable response is 
the release of several molecules—such 
as glutamate, GABA, and ATP—that are 
traditionally considered to be neuro- 
transmitters. Release of such "gliotrans- 
mitters" occurs both via the calcium-trig- 
gered exocytotic mechanisms employed 
in presynaptic terminals of neurons (see 
Figure 5.3), as well as via unconventional 
release mechanisms such as permeation 
through certain ion channels. 
The ability both to respond to and 
to release neurotransmitters potentially 
makes glia participants in synaptic sig- 
naling. Indeed, release of neurotransmit- 
ters from a variety of presynaptic termi- 
nals has been found to elicit responses 
in glial cells. Further, release of "glio- 
transmitters" has been found to regulate 
transmission at numerous synapses 
(Figure D). In some cases, glia regulate 
release of transmitters from presynaptic 
terminals, while in other cases they alter 
postsynaptic responsiveness. 
This ability of glia to participate in 
synaptic signaling has led to the con- 
cept of the tripartite synapse, a three- 
way junction involving the presynaptic

terminal, the postsynaptic process, and 
neighboring glial cells. While there is still 
debate about the physiological signifi- 
cance of such neuron-glial interactions, 
the newfound ability of glia to release 
neurotransmitters, similar to presynaptic 
terminals, and to respond to neurotrans- 
mitters, similar to postsynaptic neurons, 
promises to dramatically change our 
_ view of brain signaling mechanisms.

(Figure 5.23). Recent work suggests that glial cells may also

Summary 
Synapses communicate the information carried by action 
potentials from one neuron to the next in neural circuits. 
The cellular mechanisms that underlie synaptic transmis- 
sion are closely related to the mechanisms that generate 
other types of neuronal electrical signals, namely, ion flow 
through membrane channels. In the case of electrical syn- 
apses, these channels are gap junctions; direct but passive 
flow of current through the gap junctions is the basis for 
transmission. In the case of chemical synapses, channels 
with smaller and more selective pores are activated by 
the binding of neurotransmitters to postsynaptic recep- 
tors following release of the neurotransmitters from the 
presynaptic terminal. The large number of neurotransmit- 
ters in the nervous system can be divided into two broad 
classes: small-molecule transmitters and neuropeptides.

CHAPTER 5 
Neurotransmitters are synthesized from defined precur- 
sors by regulated enzymatic pathways, packaged into one 
of several types of synaptic vesicles, and released into the 
synaptic cleft in a Ca**-dependent manner. Many synapses 
release more than one type of neurotransmitter, and mul- 
tiple transmitters can even be packaged within the same 
synaptic vesicle. Transmitter agents are released presynap- 
tically in units or quanta, reflecting their storage within syn- 
aptic vesicles. Vesicles discharge their contents into the syn- 
aptic cleft when the presynaptic depolarization generated 
by the invasion of an action potential opens voltage-gated 
calcium channels, allowing Ca** to enter the presynaptic 
terminal. How calcium triggers neurotransmitter release 
is not yet established, but synaptotagmin, SNAREs, and 
a number of other proteins found within the presynaptic 
terminal are clearly involved. Postsynaptic receptors are a 
diverse group of proteins that transduce binding of neu- 
rotransmitters into electrical signals by opening or closing 
postsynaptic ion channels. Two broadly different families 
of neurotransmitter receptors have evolved to carry out the 
postsynaptic signaling actions of neurotransmitters. The 
postsynaptic currents produced by the synchronous open- 
ing or closing of ion channels changes the conductance 
of the postsynaptic cell, thus increasing or decreasing its 
excitability. Conductance changes that increase the prob- 
ability of firing an action potential are excitatory, whereas 
those that decrease the probability of generating an action 
potential are inhibitory. Because postsynaptic neurons are 
usually innervated by many different inputs, the integrated 
effect of the conductance changes underlying all EPSPs and 
IPSPs produced in a postsynaptic cell at any moment deter- 
mines whether or not the cell fires an action potential. The 
postsynaptic effects of neurotransmitters are terminated by 
the degradation of the transmitter in the synaptic cleft, by 
transport of the transmitter back into cells, or by diffusion 
out of the synaptic cleft. The response elicited at a given 
synapse depends on the type of neurotransmitter released 
and the postsynaptic complement of receptors and associ- 
ated channels.

Overview 
NEURONS IN THE HUMAN BRAIN COMMUNICATE with one another, for the 
most part, by releasing chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. A large 
number of neurotransmitters are known. The main excitatory neurotransmitter in 
the brain is the amino acid glutamate, while the main inhibitory neurotransmitter 
is y-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These and all other neurotransmitters evoke post- 
synaptic responses by binding to and activating neurotransmitter receptors. Most 
neurotransmitters are capable of activating several different receptors, yielding many 
possible modes of synaptic signaling. After activating their postsynaptic receptors, 
neurotransmitters are removed from the synaptic cleft by neurotransmitter transport- 
ers or by degradative enzymes. Abnormalities in the function of neurotransmitter 
systems contribute to a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders; thus, 
many neuropharmacological therapies are based on drugs that affect neurotransmit- 
ters, their receptors, and/or the transporters responsible for removal of neurotrans- 
mitters from the synaptic cleft. 
Categories of Neurotransmitters 
There are more than 100 different neurotransmitters. This large number of trans- 
mitters allows for tremendous diversity in chemical signaling between neurons. It 
is useful to separate this panoply of transmitters into two broad categories based 
simply on size (Figure 6.1). Neuropeptides are relatively large transmitter molecules 
composed of 3 to 36 amino acids. Individual amino acids, such as glutamate and 
GABA, as well as the transmitters acetylcholine, serotonin, and histamine, are much 
smaller than neuropeptides and have therefore come to be called small-molecule 
neurotransmitters. Within the category of small-molecule neurotransmitters, the 
biogenic amines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, and hista- 
mine) are often discussed separately because of their similar chemical properties and 
postsynaptic actions. The particulars of synthesis, packaging, release, and removal 
differ for each neurotransmitter (Table 6.1). This chapter will describe some of the 
main features of these transmitters and their postsynaptic receptors.

transported back into nerve terminals, where it is used to 
resynthesize ACh. 
Among the many interesting drugs that interact with 
cholinergic enzymes are the organophosphates. This group 
includes some potent chemical warfare agents. One such 
compound is "Sarin," made notorious in 1995 when a 
group of terrorists released this nerve gas in Tokyo's un- 
derground rail system. Organophosphates can be lethal 
because they inhibit AChE, allowing ACh to accumulate 
at cholinergic synapses. This buildup of ACh depolarizes 
the postsynaptic cell and renders it refractory to subsequent 
ACh release, causing neuromuscular paralysis and other ef- 
fects. The high sensitivity of insects to AChE inhibitors has 
made organophosphates popular insecticides. 
Many of the postsynaptic actions of ACh are mediated 
by the nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR), so named be- 
cause the CNS stimulant nicotine also binds to these re- 
ceptors. Nicotine consumption produces some degree of 
euphoria, relaxation, and eventually addiction, effects be- 
lieved to be mediated by nAChRs. As described in Chapter 
5, nAChRs are nonselective cation channels that gener- 
ate excitatory postsynaptic responses. A number of toxins 
FIGURE 6.2 Acetylcholine metabolism in 
cholinergic nerve terminals. The synthesis 
of acetylcholine from choline and acetyl CoA 
requires choline acetyltransferase. Acetyl CoA is 
derived from pyruvate generated by glycolysis, 
while choline is transported into the termi- 
nals via a Na*-dependent cotransporter (ChT). 
Acetylcholine is loaded into synaptic vesicles via 
a vesicular transporter (VAChT). After release, 
acetylcholine is rapidly metabolized by acetyl- 
cholinesterase, and choline is transported back 
into the terminal via the ChT. 
specifically bind to and block nicotinic receptors (Box 6A). 
The availability of these highly specific ligands—particularly 
a component of snake venom called a-bungarotoxin—has 
provided a valuable way to isolate and purify nAChRs. As 
a result, nAChRs are the best-studied type of ionotropic 
neurotransmitter receptor, and unraveling their molecular 
organization has provided deep insights into the workings 
of ionotropic receptors. 
Nicotinic receptors are large protein complexes con- 
sisting of five subunits. At the neuromuscular junction, 
the nAChR contains two a subunits, each of which has a 
binding site that binds a single molecule of ACh. Both ACh 
binding sites must be occupied for the receptor to be acti- 
vated, so that only relatively high concentrations of ACh 
activate these receptors. These subunits also bind other 
ligands, such as nicotine and a-bungarotoxin. The a sub- 
units are combined with up to four other types of subunit— 
B, 8, and either y or e—in the ratio 20:18:18:1y/e. Neuronal 
nAChRs differ from those of muscle in that they (1) lack 
sensitivity to a-bungarotoxin, and (2) comprise only two 
receptor subunit types (a and 8), which are present in a 
ratio of 30:28. 
Each subunit of the receptor contains a large extracellular 
region (which in a subunits contains the ACh binding site) 
as well as four membrane-spanning domains (Figure 6.3A).

The transmembrane domains of the five individual subunits 
together form a channel with a central membrane-spanning 
pore (Figure 6.3B,C). The width of this pore (Figure 6.3D) is 
substantially larger than that of the pores of voltage-gated 
ion channels (see Figure 4.7), consistent with the relatively 
poor ability of nACh receptors to discriminate between dif- 
ferent cations. Within this pore is a constriction that may 
represent the gate of the receptor. Binding of ACh to the a 
subunits is thought to cause a conformational change that 
rearranges the receptor transmembrane domains, thereby 
opening the gate and permitting ions to diffuse through the 
channel pore (Figure 6.3E). 
In summary, the nACh receptor is a ligand-gated ion 
channel. The intimate association of the ACh binding sites

CHAPTER 6 
_ Poisonous plants and venomous ani- 
mals are widespread in nature. The 
_ toxins they produce have been used for 
a variety of purposes, including hunt- 
. 
_ ing, healing, mind-altering, and, more 
_ recently, research. Many of these toxins 
_ have potent actions on the nervous 
_ system, often interfering with synaptic 
_ transmission by targeting neurotrans- 
_ mitter receptors. The poisons found in 
_ some organisms contain a single type of 
toxin, whereas others contain a mixture 
of tens or even hundreds of toxins. 
Given the central role of ACh recep- 
_ tors in mediating muscle contraction 
at neuromuscular junctions in numer- 
_ ous species, it is not surprising that a 
large number of natural toxins interfere 
with transmission at this synapse. In 
fact, the classification of nicotinic and 
muscarinic ACh receptors is based on 
_ the sensitivity of these receptors to 
the toxic plant alkaloids nicotine and 
muscarine, which activate nicotinic and 
muscarinic ACh receptors, respectively. 
Nicotine is derived from the dried 
leaves of the tobacco plant Nicotinia 
tabacum, and muscarine is from the 
poisonous red mushroom Amanita 
muscaria. Both toxins are stimulants 
that produce nausea, vomiting, mental 
confusion, and convulsions. Muscarine

BOX 6A Neurotoxins that Act on Postsynaptic Receptors 
poisoning can also lead to circulatory 
collapse, coma, and death. 
The poison a-bungarotoxin, one 
of many peptides that together make 
up the venom of the banded krait, 
Bungarus multicinctus (Figure A), blocks 
transmission at neuromuscular junc- 
tions and is used by the snake to 
paralyze its prey. This 74-amino-acid 
toxin blocks neuromuscular transmis- 
sion by irreversibly binding to nicotinic 
ACh receptors, thus preventing ACh 
from opening postsynaptic ion chan- 
nels. Paralysis ensues because skeletal 
muscles can no longer be activated by 
motor neurons. As a result of its speci- 
ficity and its high affinity for nicotinic 
ACh receptors, a-bungarotoxin has 
contributed greatly to understanding 
the ACh receptor. Other snake toxins 
that block nicotinic ACh receptors are 
cobra a-neurotoxin and the sea snake 
peptide erabutoxin. The same strat- 
egy used by these snakes to paralyze 
prey was adopted by South American 
Indians who used curare, a mixture 
of plant toxins from Chondrodendron 
tomentosum, as an arrowhead poison 
to immobilize their quarry. Curare 
also blocks nicotinic ACh recep- 
tors; the active agent is the alkaloid 
§-tubocurarine. 
(B) 
Another interesting class of animal 
toxins that selectively block nicotinic 
ACh and other receptors includes the 
peptides produced by fish-hunting 
marine cone snails (Figure B). These 
colorful snails kill small fish by "shoot- 
ing" venomous darts into them. The 
venom contains hundreds of peptides, 
known as the conotoxins, many of 
which target proteins that are impor- 
tant in synaptic transmission. There 
are conotoxin peptides that block Ca* 
channels, Na* channels, glutamate 
receptors, and ACh receptors. The array 
of physiological responses produced 
by these peptides all serve to immo- 
bilize any prey unfortunate enough to 
encounter the cone snail. Many other 
organisms, including other mollusks, 
corals, worms and frogs, also utilize 
toxins containing specific blockers of 
ACh receptors. 
Other natural toxins have mind- or 
behavior-altering effects and in some 
cases have been used for thousands of 
years by shamans and, more recently, 
physicians. Two examples are plant 
alkaloid toxins that block muscarinic 
ACh receptors: atropine from deadly 
nightshade (belladonna), and scopol- 
amine from henbane. Because these 
(Continued on next page) 

| BOX 6A (continued) 
_ plants grow wild in many parts of the 
_ world, exposure is not unusual, and 
_ poisoning by either toxin can also be 
fatal. 
__ 
Another postsynaptic neurotoxin 
_ that, like nicotine, is used as a social 
drug is found in the seeds from the 
betel nut, Areca catechu (Figure C). 
Betel nut chewing, although virtually 
unknown in the United States, is prac- 
ticed by up to 25% of the population in 
India, Bangladesh, Ceylon, Malaysia, 
and the Philippines. Chewing these 
nuts produces a euphoria caused by 
arecoline, an alkaloid agonist of nico- 
tinic ACh receptors. Like nicotine, are- 
coline is an addictive central nervous 
system stimulant. 
Many other neurotoxins alter trans- 
mission at noncholinergic synapses. 
For example, amino acids found in 
certain mushrooms, algae, and seeds 
are potent glutamate receptor agonists. 
The excitotoxic amino acids kainate, 
from the red alga Digenea simplex, and 
quisqualate, from the seed of Quisqualis 
indica, are used to distinguish two fami- 
lies of glutamate receptors (see text). 
Other neurotoxic amino acid activators 
of glutamate receptors include ibotenic 
acid and acromelic acid, both found 
NEUROTRANSMITTERS AND THEIR RECEPTORS

in mushrooms, and domoate, which 
occurs in algae, seaweed, and mus- 
sels. Another large group of peptide 
neurotoxins blocks glutamate receptors. 
These include the a-agatoxins from the 
funnel web spider, 
NSTX-3 from the 
orb weaver spider, jorotoxin from the 
Joro spider, and 6-philanthotoxin from 
wasp venom, as well as many cone 
snail toxins. 
All the toxins discussed so far tar- 
get excitatory synapses. The inhibitory 
GABA and glycine receptors, how- 
ever, have not been overlooked by the 
exigencies of survival. Strychnine, an 
alkaloid extracted from the seeds of 
Strychnos nux-vomica, is the only drug 
known to have specific actions on 
transmission at glycinergic synapses. 
Because the toxin blocks glycine recep- 
tors, strychnine poisoning causes over- 
activity in the spinal cord and brain- 
stem, leading to seizures. Strychnine 
has long been used commercially as a 
poison for rodents, although alterna- 
tives such as the anticoagulant cou- 
madin are now more popular because 
they are safer for humans. Neurotoxins 
that block GABA, receptors include 
plant alkaloids such as bicuculline from 
Dutchman's breeches and picrotoxin 
from Anamirta cocculus. Dieldrin, a 
commercial insecticide, also blocks 
these receptors. These agents are, like 
strychnine, powerful central nervous 
system stimulants. Muscimol, a mush- 
room toxin that is a powerful depres- 
sant as well as a hallucinogen, activates 
GABA, receptors. A synthetic analogue 
of GABA, baclofen, is a GABA, agonist 
that reduces EPSPs in some brainstem 
neurons and is used clinically to reduce 
the frequency and severity of muscle 
spasms. 
Chemical warfare between spe- 
cies has thus given rise to a staggering 
array of molecules that target syn- 
apses throughout the nervous system. 
Although these toxins are designed to 
defeat normal synaptic transmission, 
they have also provided a set of power- 
ful tools to understand postsynaptic 
mechanisms.

of this receptor with the pore of the channel permits the rapid 
response to ACh that is characteristic of these receptors. This 
general arrangement—several receptor subunits coming to- 
gether to form a ligand-gated ion channel—is characteristic 
of all the ionotropic receptors at fast-acting synapses. Thus, 
the nicotinic receptor has served as a paradigm for studies 
of other ionotropic receptors, at the same time leading to a 
much deeper appreciation of several neuromuscular diseases 
(Box 6B). The subunits used to make other types of ionotropic 
neurotransmitter receptors are summarized in Figure 6.3F. 
A second class of ACh receptors is activated by mus- 
carine, a poisonous alkaloid found in some mushrooms 
(see Box 6A), and thus they are referred to as muscarinic 
ACh receptors (nAChRs). mAChRs are metabotropic 
and mediate most of the effects of ACh in the brain. Like 
other metabotropic receptors, mAChRs have seven helical 
membrane-spanning domains (Figure 6.4A). ACh binds 
to a single binding site on the extracellular surface of the 
mAChR; this binding site is formed from loops that con- 
nect several of the transmembrane helices (Figure 6.4B). 
Binding of ACh to this site causes a conformational change 
that permits G-proteins to bind to the cytoplasmic domain 
of the mAChR (Figure 6.4A). 
Five subtypes of mAChR are known (Figure 6.4C) and 
are coupled to different types of G-proteins, thereby causing 
a variety of slow postsynaptic responses. Muscarinic ACh 
receptors are highly expressed in the striatum and various 
other forebrain regions, where they activate inward rectifier 
K+ channels or Ca?*-activated K* channels, thereby exert- 
ing an inhibitory influence on dopamine-mediated motor 
effects. In other parts of the brain, such as the hippocam- 
pus, mAChkRs are excitatory and act by closing KCNQ-type 
K*channels. These receptors are also found in the ganglia 
of the peripheral nervous system. Finally, mAChRs medi- 
ate peripheral cholinergic responses of autonomic effector 
organs such as heart, smooth muscle, and exocrine glands 
and are responsible for the inhibition of heart rate by the 
vagus nerve. Numerous drugs act as mAChR agonists or 
antagonists; mAChR blockers that are therapeutically use- 
ful include atropine (used to dilate the pupil), scopolamine 
(effective in preventing motion sickness), and ipratropium 
(useful in the treatment of asthma).

Glutamate 
Glutamate is the most important transmitter for normal brain 
function. Nearly all excitatory neurons in the central nervous 
system are glutamatergic, and it is estimated that over half 
of all brain synapses release this neurotransmitter. During 
brain trauma, there is excessive release of glutamate that can 
produce "excitotoxic" brain damage (Box 6C, p. 121). 
Glutamate is a nonessential amino acid that does not cross 
the blood-brain barrier and therefore must be synthesized 
in neurons from local precursors. The most prevalent pre- 
cursor for glutamate synthesis is glutamine, which is taken 
up into presynaptic terminals by the system A transporter 2 
(SAT2) and is then metabolized to glutamate by the mito- 
chondrial enzyme glutaminase (Figure 6.5). Glucose metabo- 
lized by neurons also can be used to synthesize glutamate 
by transamination of 2-oxoglutarate, an intermediate of the 
tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle. Glutamate synthesized in 
the presynaptic cytoplasm is packaged into synaptic vesicles 
by vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT). At least three 
different VGLUT genes have been identified, with different 
VGLUT involved in packaging glutamate into vesicles at dif- 
ferent types of glutamatergic presynaptic terminals. 
Once released, glutamate is removed from the synap- 
tic cleft by the excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). 
EAATs are a family of five different Na*-dependent gluta- 
mate co-transporters. Some EAATs are present in glial cells 
and others in presynaptic terminals. Glutamate transported 
into glial cells via EAATs is converted into glutamine by 
the enzyme glutamine synthetase. Glutamine is then trans- 
ported out of the glial cells by a different transporter, the

BOX 6B Myasthenia Gravis: An Autoimmune Disease of Neuromuscular Synapses 
_ Myasthenia gravis is a disease that inter- 
_ feres with transmission between motor: 
_ neurons and skeletal muscle fibers and 
__ afflicts approximately 1 of every 200,000 
people. Originally described by the 
British physician Thomas Willis in 1685, 
the hallmark of the disorder is muscle 
weakness, particularly during sustained 
activity (Figure A). Although the course 
is variable, myasthenia commonly 
affects muscles controlling the eyelids 
(resulting in drooping of the eyelids, or 
ptosis) and eye movements (resulting 
in double vision, or diplopia). Muscles 
controlling facial expression, chewing, 
swallowing, and speaking are other 
common targets. 
An important indication of the cause 
of myasthenia gravis came from the 
clinical observation that the muscle 
weakness improves following treatment 
with neostigmine and other inhibitors 
of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that 
normally degrades acetylcholine at the 
neuromuscular junction (see Figure A). 
Studies of muscle obtained by biopsy 
showed that both end plate potentials 
(EPPs) and miniature end plate poten- 
tials (MEPPs) are much smaller than 
normal (Figure B).

Myasthenia gravis 
Because both the frequency of MEPPs 
and the quantal content of EPPs are 
normal, it seemed likely that myasthenia 
gravis affects the postsynaptic muscle 
cells. Indeed, electron microscopy shows 
that the structure of neuromuscular 
junctions is altered, obvious changes 
being a widening of the synaptic cleft 
and an apparent reduction in the num- 
ber of acetylcholine receptors in the 
postsynaptic membrane. 
A chance observation in the early 
1970s led to the discovery of the 
underlying cause of these changes. Jim 
Patrick and Jon Lindstrom, then work- 
ing at the Salk Institute, were attempt- 
ing to raise antibodies to nicotinic ace- 
tylcholine receptors by immunizing rab- 
bits with the receptors. Unexpectedly, 
the immunized rabbits developed 
muscle weakness that improved after 
treatment with acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitors. Subsequent work showed 
that the blood of myasthenic patients 
contains antibodies directed against the 
acetylcholine receptor, and that these 
antibodies are present at neuromuscu- 
lar synapses. Removal of antibodies by 
plasma exchange improves the weak- 
ness. Finally, injecting the serum of 
Myasthenia gravis after 
neostigmine treatment

Time (ms) 
myasthenic patients into mice produces 
myasthenic effects (because the serum 
carries circulating antibodies). 
These findings indicate that myas- 
thenia gravis is an autoimmune disease 
that targets nicotinic acetylcholine recep- 
tors. The immune response reduces the 
number of functional receptors at the 
neuromuscular junction and eventually 
destroys them altogether, diminishing 
the efficiency of synaptic transmission; 
muscle weakness occurs because motor 
neurons are less capable of exciting the 
postsynaptic muscle cells. This causal 
sequence also explains why cholinester- 
ase inhibitors alleviate the symptoms. 
The inhibitors increase the concentration 
© 
of ACh in the synaptic cleft, allowing 
more effective activation of those post- 
synaptic receptors not yet destroyed by 
the immune system. However, it is still 
not clear what triggers this autoimmune

system N transporter 1 (SN1), and transported into nerve 
terminals via SAT2. This overall sequence of events is re- 
ferred to as the glutamate-glutamine cycle (see Figure 
6.5). This cycle allows glial cells and presynaptic terminals 
to cooperate both to maintain an adequate supply of gluta- 
mate for synaptic transmission and to terminate postsyn- 
aptic glutamate action. 
There are several types of ionotropic glutamate receptors 
(see Figure 6.3F). AMPA receptors, 
NMDA receptors, 
and kainate receptors are named after the agonists that 
activate them: AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4- 
isoxazole-propionate), 
NMDA (N-methyl-p-aspartate), and 
kainic acid. All of these receptors are glutamate-gated cation 
channels that allow the passage of Na* and k', similar to the 
nAChR. Hence AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptor activa- 
tion always produces excitatory postsynaptic responses. 
Most central synapses possess both AMPA and NMDA 
receptors, Antagonist drugs that selectively block either 
AMPA or NMDA receptors are often used to identify syn- 
aptic responses mediated by each receptor type. Such ex- 
periments reveal that EPSCs produced by NMDA receptors 
are slower and last longer than those produced by AMPA 
receptors (Figure 6.6A). EPSCs generated by AMPA recep- 
tors usually are much larger than those produced by other 
types of ionotropic glutamate receptors, so that AMPA re- 
ceptors are the primary mediators of excitatory transmission 
in the brain. The physiological roles of kainate receptors 
FIGURE 6.5 Glutamate synthesis and 
cycling between neurons and glia. The 
action of glutamate released into the syn- 
aptic cleft is terminated by uptake into sur- 
rounding glial cells (and neurons) via excit- 
atory amino acid transporters (EAATS). Within 
glial cells, glutamate is converted to gluta- 
mine by glutamine synthetase and released 
by glial cells through the SN1 transporter. 
Glutamine is taken up into nerve terminals 
via SAT2 transporters and converted back to 
glutamate by glutaminase. Glutamate is then 
loaded into synaptic vesicles via vesicular 
glutamate transporters (VGLUT) to complete 
the cycle. 
are less well defined; in some cases, these receptors are 
found on presynaptic terminals and serve as a feedback 
mechanism to regulate glutamate release. When found on 
postsynaptic cells, kainate receptors generate EPSCs that 
rise quickly but decay more slowly than those mediated by 
AMPA receptors (Figure 6.6B). 
NMDA receptors have physiological properties that set 
them apart from the other ionotropic glutamate receptors. 
Perhaps most significant is that the pore of the NMDA recep- 
tor channel allows the entry of Ca** in addition to Na* and K*. 
As a result, EPSPs produced by NMDA receptors increase the 
concentration of Ca** within the postsynaptic neuron, with 
Ca** then acting as a second messenger to activate intracellu- 
lar signaling cascades (see Chapter 7). Another key property 
is that Mg** blocks the pore of this channel at hyperpolar- 
ized membrane potentials, while depolarization pushes Me?* 
out of the pore (Figure 6.6C). This imparts a peculiar voltage 
dependence to current flow through the receptor (red line 
in Figure 6.6D); removing extracellular Mg eliminates this 
behavior (blue line), which demonstrates that Meg** confers 
the voltage dependence. Because of this property, NMDA 
receptors pass cations (most notably Ca**) only when the 
postsynaptic membrane potential is depolarized, such as dur- 
ing activation of strong excitatory inputs and/or during action 
potential firing in the postsynaptic cell. This requirement for 
the coincident presence of both glutamate and postsynaptic 
depolarization to open NMDA receptors is widely thought

as long-term synaptic plasticity (see Chapter 8). Another un- 
usual feature is that gating of NMDA receptors requires a 
co-agonist—the amino acid glycine, which is present in the 
ambient extracellular environment of the brain. 
Like all ionotropic receptors, AMPA receptors are com- 
posed of multiple subunits. The four different AMPA recep- 
tor subunits are designated GluA1 to GluA4 (see Figure 
6.3F). Each subunit has several different domains, including 
an extracellular ligand-binding domain that is responsible 
for binding glutamate, and a transmembrane domain that

are organized into the tetrameric structure shown in Fig- 
ure 6.7B-D. Unlike nAChRs, the extracellular structure of 
AMPA receptors is asymmetrical and therefore looks dif- 
ferent when viewed from its front and side surfaces (Figure 
6.7B,C). The AMPA receptor is Y-shaped (Figure 6.7B), with 
the large extracellular domains of the subunits narrowing 
down as the receptor passes through the plasma membrane 
(Figure 6.7D). The extracellular ligand-binding domains 
have a characteristic "clamshell" shape, with glutamate and 
other ligands binding within the opening of the clamshell

ture to "shut"; this movement then causes the gate helices 
within the transmembrane domain to move and thereby 
open the channel pore (Figure 6.7E). 
NMDA receptors are also tetrameric assemblies of sub- 
units. There are three groups of NMDA receptor subunits

types of subunits (see Figure 6.3F). While GluN2 subunits 
bind glutamate, GluN1 and GluN3 bind glycine. NMDA 
receptor tetramers typically are composed of two gluta- 
mate-binding subunits (GluN2) and two glycine-binding 
subunits (GluN1). In some cases, GluN3 replaces one of the 
two GluN2 subunits. This mix of subunits ensures that the 
receptor binds both to glutamate released from presynaptic 
terminals and to the ambient glycine co-agonist. NMDA re- 
ceptor subunits are thought to form a structure that closely 
resembles AMPA receptors (Figure 6.7F). 

_ Excitotoxicity refers to the ability of 
_ glutamate and related compounds to 
_ destroy neurons by prolonged excit- 
_ atory synaptic transmission. Normally, 
the concentration of glutamate released 
_ into the synaptic cleft rises to high lev- 
els (approximately 1 mM), but remains 
at this concentration for only a few 
milliseconds. If abnormally high levels 
of glutamate accumulate in the cleft, 
the excessive activation of neuronal 
glutamate receptors can literally excite 
neurons to death. 
The phenomenon of excitotoxic- 
ity was discovered in 1957 when D. R. 
Lucas and J. P. Newhouse serendipi- 
tously found that feeding sodium glu- 
tamate to infant mice destroys neurons 
in the retina. Roughly a decade later, 
John Olney at Washington University 
extended this discovery by showing that 
regions of glutamate-induced neuronal 
loss can occur throughout the brain. 
The damage was evidently restricted to 
the postsynaptic cells—the dendrites of 
the target neurons were grossly swol- 
len—while the presynaptic terminals 
were spared. Olney also examined 
the relative potency of glutamate 
analogs and found that their neuro- 
toxic actions paralleled their ability to 
' activate postsynaptic glutamate recep- 
tors. Furthermore, glutamate receptor 
antagonists were effective in blocking 
the neurotoxic effects of glutamate. In 
light of this evidence, Olney postulated 
that glutamate destroys neurons by a 
mechanism similar to transmission at 
excitatory glutamatergic synapses, and 
coined the term excitotoxic to refer to 
this pathological effect. 
BOX 6C Excitotoxicity Following Acute Brain Injury 
NEUROTRANSMITTERS AND THEIR RECEPTORS 
121 
Evidence that excitotoxicity is an 
important cause of neuronal damage 
after brain injury has come primar- 
ily from studying the consequences of 
reduced blood flow. The most com- 
mon cause of reduced blood flow to 
the brain (ischemia) is the occlusion of 
a cerebral blood vessel (i.e., a stroke; 
see Box B in the Appendix). The idea 
that excessive synaptic activity contrib- 
utes to ischemic injury emerged from 
the observation that concentrations of 
glutamate and aspartate in the extracel- 
lular space around neurons increase 
during ischemia. Moreover, injection of 
glutamate receptor antagonists into the 
brains of experimental animals protects 
neurons from ischemia-induced dam- 
age. Together, these findings imply that 
extracellular accumulation of glutamate 
during ischemia activates glutamate 
receptors excessively, and that this 
somehow triggers a chain of events that 
leads to neuronal death. The reduced 
supply of oxygen and glucose presum- 
ably elevates extracellular glutamate 
levels by slowing the energy-dependent 
removal of glutamate at synapses. 
Excitotoxic mechanisms have been 
shown to be involved in other acute 
forms of neuronal insult, including 
hypoglycemia, trauma, and repeated 
intense seizures (called status epilep- 
ticus). Understanding excitotoxicity 
therefore has important implications 
for treating a variety of neurologi- 
cal disorders. For instance, a block- 
ade of glutamate receptors could, 
in principle, protect neurons from 
injury due to stroke, trauma, or other 
causes. Unfortunately, clinical trials of 
glutamate receptor antagonists have not — 
led to much improvement in the out- 
come of stroke. The ineffectiveness of 
this quite logical treatment is probably 
due to several factors, one of which is 
that substantial excitotoxic injury occurs 
quite soon after ischemia, prior to the 
typical initiation of treatment. It is also 
likely that excitotoxicity is only one of 
several mechanisms by which ischemia 
damages neurons; other candidates 
include damage secondary to inflam- 
mation. Pharmacological interventions 
that target all of these mechanisms 
nonetheless hold considerable promise 
for minimizing brain injury after stroke 
and other causes.

In addition to these ionotropic glutamate receptors, 
there are three classes of metabotropic glutamate recep- 
tor (mGluRs) (see Figure 6.4C). These receptors, which 
modulate postsynaptic ion channels indirectly, differ in 
their coupling to intracellular signal transduction path- 
ways (see Chapter 7) and in their sensitivity to pharmaco- 
logical agents. Activation of many of these receptors leads 
to inhibition of postsynaptic Ca'* and Na* channels. Un- 
like the excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptors, mGluRs 
cause slower postsynaptic responses that can either excite 
or inhibit postsynaptic cells. As a result, the physiological 
roles of mGluRs are quite varied. Although the structure 
of mGluRs has not been fully resolved, it is known that the 
glutamate-binding domains of mGluRs are very similar 
to the clamshell-shaped ligand-binding domains of iono- 
tropic glutamate receptors (see Figure 6.7A,B). The gen- 
eral organization of mGluRs is thought to be very similar 
to that of other metabotropic receptors, such as the mA- 
ChR (see Figure 6.4A)—that is, seven helical membrane- 
spanning domains that connect the extracellular ligand 
binding domain to the intracellular domain that activates 
G proteins.

CHAPTER 6 
GABA and Glycine 
Most inhibitory synapses in the brain and spinal cord use 
either y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine as neu- 
rotransmitters. Like glutamate, GABA was identified in 
brain tissue during the 1950s. The details of its synthe- 
sis and degradation emerged shortly thereafter from the 
work of Ernst Florey and Eugene Roberts. During this era, 
David Curtis and Jeffrey Watkins first showed that GABA 
can inhibit action potential firing in mammalian neurons. 
Subsequent studies by Edward Kravitz and colleagues es- 
tablished that GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter at 
lobster neuromuscular synapses. It is now known that as 
many as a third of the synapses in the brain use GABA 
as their inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABA is most com- 
monly found in local circuit interneurons, although cer- 
ebellar Purkinje cells provide an example of a GABAergic 
projection neuron (see Chapter 19). 
The predominant precursor for GABA synthesis is 
glucose, which is metabolized to glutamate by the tri- 
carboxylic acid cycle enzymes. (Pyruvate and glutamine 
can also act as GABA precursors.) The enzyme glutamic 
acid decarboxylase (GAD), which is found almost exclu- 
sively in GABAergic neurons, catalyzes the conversion 
of glutamate to GABA (Figure 6.8A). GAD requires a 
co-factor, pyridoxal phosphate, for activity. Because pyri- 
doxal phosphate is derived from vitamin B,, a deficiency 
of this vitamin can lead to diminished GABA synthesis. 
The significance of this fact became clear after a disas- 
trous series of infant deaths was linked to the omission of 
vitamin B, from infant formula. The absence of vitamin B, 
greatly reduced the GABA content of the brain, and the 
subsequent loss of synaptic inhibition caused seizures 
that in some cases were fatal. Once GABA is synthesized, 
it is transported into synaptic vesicles via a vesicular in- 
hibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT). 
The mechanism of GABA removal is similar to that for 
glutamate: Both neurons and glia contain high-affinity 
Na*-dependent co-transporters for GABA. These co- 
transporters are termed GATs, and several forms of GAT 
have been identified. Most GABA is eventually converted 
to succinate, which is metabolized further in the tricarbox- 
ylic acid cycle that mediates cellular ATP synthesis. Two 
mitochondrial enzymes are required for this degradation: 
GABA transaminase and succinic semialdehyde dehydro- 
genase. There are also other pathways for degradation of 
GABA, the most noteworthy of which results in the pro- 
duction of y-hydroxybutyrate, a GABA derivitive that has 
been abused as a "date rape" drug. Oral administration of 
y-hydroxybutyrate can cause euphoria, memory deficits, 
and unconsciousness. Presumably these effects arise from 
actions on GABAergic synapses in the CNS. Inhibition of 
GABA breakdown causes a rise in tissue GABA content 
and an increase synaptic inhibitory activity

Synthesis, release, and reuptake of the inhibitory 
neurotransmitters GABA and glycine. (A) GABA is synthesized from 
glutamate by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase, which requires pyri- 
doxal phosphate. (B) Glycine can be synthesized by a number of metabolic 
pathways; in the brain, the major precursor is serine. High-affinity transport- 
ers terminate the actions of these transmitters and return GABA or glycine 
to the synaptic terminals for reuse, with both transmitters being loaded into 
synaptic vesicles via the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT). 

GABAergic synapses employ three types of postsynaptic 
receptors, called GABA y GABA,, and GABA... GABA, and 
GABA. are ionotropic receptors, while GABA, are metabo- 
tropic receptors. Like other ionotropic receptors, GABA, 
and GABA. are pentamers assembled from a combination 
of numerous types of subunits (see Figure 6.3F). As a re- 
sult of this subunit diversity, the composition and function 
of GABA, receptors differ widely among neuronal types. 
While the structure of GABA, receptors is not yet resolved, 
it is likely that they are similar in structure to nAChRs (see 
Figure 6.3). 
The ionotropic GABA receptors are GABA-gated an- 
ion channels, with Cl being the main permeant ion under 
physiological conditions (Figure 6.9A). The reversal poten- 
tial for Cl usually is more negative than the threshold for 
neuronal firing (see Figure 5.21) due to the action of the 
K*/ Cl cotransporter (see Figure 4.9F), which keeps in- 
tracellular Cl concentration low. Thus, activation of these 
GABA receptors causes an influx of negatively charged Cl- 
that inhibits postsynaptic cells (Figure 6.9B). In cases where 
postsynaptic CF concentration is high—in developing neu- 
rons, for example—GABA, receptors can excite their post- 
synaptic targets (Box 6D). 
Drugs that act as agonists or modulators of postsynaptic 
GABA receptors, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, 
are used clinically to treat epilepsy and are effective seda- 
tives and anesthetics. Binding sites for GABA, barbiturates, 
steroids, and picrotoxin are all located within the pore

domain of the channel (Figure 6.9B). Another site, called 
the benzodiazepine binding site, lies outside the pore and 
modulates channel activity. Benzodiazepines such as diaz- 
epam (Valium®) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium®) are anx- 
iety-reducing drugs that enhance GABAergic transmission 
by binding to the a and 6 subunits of GABA, receptors. 
Barbiturates such as phenobarbital and pentobarbital are 
hypnotics that bind to the a and 8 subunits of some GABA 
receptors and are used therapeutically for anesthesia and 
to control epilepsy. Another drug that can alter the activ- 
ity of GABA-mediated inhibitory circuits is alcohol; at least 
some aspects of drunken behavior are caused by alcohol- 
mediated alterations in ionotropic GABA receptors. 
The metabotropic GABA, receptors are also widely dis- 
tributed in the brain. Like the ionotropic GABA receptors, 
GABA, receptors are inhibitory. Rather than activating Cl- 
selective channels, however, GABA,-mediated inhibition 
is often due to the activation of K* channels. A second 
mechanism for GABA,-mediated inhibition is by block- 
ing Ca** channels, which also hyperpolarizes postsynaptic 
cells. The structure of GABA, receptors is thought to be 
similar to that of other metabotropic receptors, although 
GABA, receptors assemble as heterodimers of B1 and B2 
subunits. 
The distribution of the neutral amino acid glycine in 
the central nervous system is more localized than that of 
GABA. About half of the inhibitory synapses in the spi- 
nal cord use glycine; most other inhibitory synapses use

BOX 6D Excitatory Actions of GABA in the Developing Brain 
_ Although GABA normally functions 
as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in 
_ the mature brain, in the developing 
brain GABA excites its target cells. This 
remarkable reversal of action arises 
from developmental changes in intra-- 
cellular Cl homeostasis. The mecha- 
nisms involved in this switch have been 
_ studied most extensively in cortical 
neurons. In young neurons, intracellular 
CF concentration is controlled mainly 
by the Na*/K*/ CF co-transporter, which 
pumps CI into the neurons and yields 
a high [CI], (Figure A, left). As the neu- 
rons continue to develop, they begin 
to express a K*/Cl co-transporter that 
pumps CI out of the neurons and low- 
ers [CI], (Figure A, right). Such shifts in 
Cl homeostasis can cause [CI]; to drop 
several-fold over the first 1 to 2 postnatal 
weeks of development (Figure B). 
Because ionotropic GABA receptors 
are Cl-permeable channels, ion flux 
through these receptors varies accord- 
ing to the electrochemical driving force 
on CI. In the young neurons, where 
[Cl], is high, E,, is more positive than 
the resting potential. As a result, GABA 
depolarizes these neurons. In addition, 
E,, often is more positive than thresh- 
old, so that GABA is able to excite these 
neurons to fire action potentials (Figure 
C). As described in the text, the lower 
[Cl], of mature neurons causes E_., to be 
more negative than the action potential 
threshold (and often more negative 
than the resting potential), resulting in 
inhibitory responses to GABA. 
Why does GABA undergo such 
a switch in its postsynaptic actions? 
While the logic of this phenomenon is 
not yet completely clear, it appears that 
depolarizing GABA responses produce 
electrical activity that controls neuronal 
proliferation, migration, growth, and 
maturation, as well as determining syn- 
aptic connectivity. Once these devel- 
opmental processes are completed, 
the resulting neural circuitry requires 
inhibitory transmission that can then 
also be provided by GABA. Further 
work will be needed to appreciate to

5 and 20 (left) demonstrates a progressive reduction in [CI], (right). (C) Developmental 
changes in [CI], cause GABA responses to shift from depolarizing in young (6-day-old)

cell, glycine is rapidly removed from the synaptic cleft by 
glycine transporters in the plasma membrane. Mutations 
in the genes coding for some of these transporters result in 
hyperglycinemia, a devastating neonatal disease character- 
ized by lethargy, seizures, and mental retardation. 
The receptors for glycine are also ligand-gated Cl- chan- 
nels; their general structure is thought to mirror that of the 
GABA, receptors. Glycine receptors are pentamers consist- 
ing of mixtures of the four types of a subunits, along with 
the accessory 8 subunit (see Figure 6.3F). Glycine receptors 
are potently blocked by strychnine, which may account for 
the toxic properties of this plant alkaloid (see Box 6A). 
The Biogenic Amines 
Biogenic amine transmitters regulate many brain functions 
and are also active in the peripheral nervous system. Be- 
cause biogenic amines are implicated in such a wide range 
of behaviors (ranging from central homeostatic functions 
to cognitive phenomena such as attention), it is not sur- 
prising that defects in biogenic amine function are impli- 
cated in most psychiatric disorders. The pharmacology of 
amine synapses is critically important in psychotherapy, 
with drugs affecting the synthesis, receptor binding, or ca- 
tabolism of these neurotransmitters being among the most 
important agents in the armamentarium of modern neuro- 
pharmacology (Box 6E). Many drugs of abuse also act on 
biogenic amine pathways. 
There are five well-established biogenic amine neu- 
rotransmitters: the three catecholamines—dopamine, 
norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine 
(adrenaline)—and histamine and serotonin (see Figure 
6.1). All the catecholamines (so named because they share 
the catechol moiety) are derived from a common precursor, 
the amino acid tyrosine (Figure 6.10). The first step in cate- 
cholamine synthesis is catalyzed by tyrosine hydroxylase in 
a reaction requiring oxygen as a co-substrate and tetrahy- 
drobiopterin as a cofactor to synthesize dihydroxyphenyl- 
alanine (DOPA). Histamine and serotonin are synthesized 
via other routes, as described below. 
e Dopamine is present in several brain regions (Figure 
6.11A), although the major dopamine-containing area of 
the brain is the corpus striatum, which receives major in- 
put from the substantia nigra and plays an essential role in 
the coordination of body movements. In Parkinson's dis- 
ease, for instance, the dopaminergic neurons of the sub- 
stantia nigra degenerate, leading to a characteristic motor 
dysfunction (see Box 18A). Dopamine is also believed to 
FIGURE 6.10 
The biosynthetic pathway for the catechol- 
amine neurotransmitters. The amino acid tyrosine is the pre- 
cursor for all three catecholamines. The first step in this reaction 
pathway, catalyzed by tyrosine hydroxylase, is rate-limiting.

CHAPTER 6 
_ The regulation of the biogenic amine 
_ neurotransmitters is altered in a vari- 
_ ety of psychiatric disorders. Indeed, 
_ most psychotropic drugs (defined as 
_ drugs that alter behavior, mood, or 
_ perception) selectively affect one or 
_ more steps in the synthesis, packag- 
_ ing, or degradation of biogenic amines. 
_ Sorting out how these drugs work has 
_ been extremely useful in beginning to 
- understand the molecular mechanisms 
underlying some of these diseases. 
Based on their effects on humans, 
_ psychotherapeutic drugs can be 
_ divided into several broad categories: 
antipsychotics, antianxiety drugs, anti- 
depressants, and stimulants. The first 
antipsychotic drug used to ameliorate 
_ disorders such as schizophrenia was 
reserpine. Reserpine was developed 
in the 1950s and initially used as an 
antihypertensive agent; it blocks the 
uptake of norepinephrine into syn- 
_ aptic vesicles and therefore depletes 
the transmitter at aminergic terminals, 
diminishing the ability of the sympa- 
thetic division of the visceral motor 
system to cause vasoconstriction (see 
Chapter 21). A major side effect— 
behavioral depression—in hyperten- 
sive patients treated with reserpine 
suggested the possibility of using 
this drug as an antipsychotic agent in 
patients suffering from agitation and 
pathological anxiety. (Reserpine's abil- 
ity to cause depression in mentally 
healthy individuals also suggested that 
aminergic transmitters are involved in 
mood disorders; see Box 29E.) 
Although reserpine is no longer 
used as an antipsychotic agent, its 
initial success stimulated the devel- 
opment of antipsychotic drugs such 
as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and 
benperidol, which over the last several 
decades have radically changed the 
approach to treating psychotic disor- 
ders. Prior to the discovery of these 
drugs, psychotic patients were typically 
hospitalized for long periods, some- 
times indefinitely, and in the 1940s 
were subjected to desperate measures 
such as frontal lobotomy (see Box 26C), 
BOX 6E Biogenic Amine Neurotransmitters and Psychiatric Disorders 
Modern antipsychotic drugs allow 
most patients to be treated on an out- 
patient basis after a brief hospital stay. 
Importantly, the clinical effectiveness 
of these drugs is correlated with their 
ability to block brain dopamine recep- 
tors, implying that activation of dopa- 
mine receptors contributes to some 
types of psychotic illness. A great deal 
of effort continues to be expended on 
developing more effective antipsychot- 
ic drugs with fewer side effects, and on 
discovering the mechanism and site of 
action of these medications. 
The second category of psycho- 
therapeutic drugs is the antianxiety 
agents. Anxiety disorders are estimated 
to afflict 10-35% of the population, 
making them the most common psy- 
chiatric problem. The two major forms 
of pathological anxiety—panic attacks 
and generalized anxiety disorder—both 
respond to drugs that affect aminergic 
transmission. The agents used to treat 
panic disorders include (1) inhibitors of 
the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO 
inhibitors) required for the catabolism 
of the amine neurotransmitters; and 
(2) blockers of serotonin receptors. The 
most effective drugs in treating general- 
ized anxiety disorder have been ben- 
zodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide 
(Librium®), and diazepam (Valium®). 
In contrast to most other psychothera- 
peutic drugs, these agents increase the 
efficacy of transmission at GABA, syn- 
apses rather than acting at aminergic 
synapses. 
Antidepressants and stimulants also 
affect aminergic transmission. A large 
number of drugs are used clinically to 
treat depressive disorders. The three 
major classes of antidepressants— 
MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepres- 
sants, and serotonin reuptake blockers 
such as fluoxetine (Prozac®) and tra- 
zodone—all influence various aspects 
of aminergic transmission. MAO 
inhibitors such as phenelzine block 
the breakdown of amines, whereas 
the tricyclic antidepressants such as 
desipramine block the reuptake of 
norepinephrine and other amines. The 
extraordinarily popular antidepressant 
fluoxetine (Prozac®) selectively blocks 
the reuptake of serotonin without 
affecting the reuptake of catechol- 
amines. Stimulants such as amphet- 
amine are also used to treat some 
depressive disorders. Amphetamine 
stimulates the release of norepineph- 
rine from nerve terminals; the tran- 
sient "high" resulting from taking 
amphetamine may reflect the emo- 
tional opposite of the depression that 
sometimes follows reserpine-induced 
norepinephrine depletion. 
Despite the relatively small num- 
ber of aminergic neurons in the 
brain, this litany of pharmacological 
actions emphasizes that they are criti- 
cally important in maintaining mental 
health.

be involved in motivation, reward, and reinforcement, and 
many drugs of abuse work by affecting dopaminergic cir- 
_ 
cuitry in the CNS (Box 6F). In addition to these roles in the 
CNS, dopamine also plays a poorly understood role in some 
sympathetic ganglia. 
Dopamine is produced by the action of DOPA decar- 
boxylase on DOPA (see Figure 6.10). Following its synthe- 
sis in the cytoplasm of presynaptic terminals, dopamine is 
loaded into synaptic vesicles via a vesicular monoamine 
transporter (VMAT). Dopamine action in the synaptic cleft 
is terminated by reuptake of dopamine into nerve terminals 
or surrounding glial cells by a Na*-dependent dopamine 
co-transporter, termed DAT. Cocaine apparently pro- 
duces its psychotropic effects by inhibiting DAT, thereby 
increasing dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft. 
Amphetamine, another addictive drug, also inhibits DAT 
as well as the transporter for norepinephrine (see below). 
The two major enzymes involved in the catabolism of do- 
pamine are monoamine oxidase (MAO) and catechol O- 
methyltransferase (COMT). Both neurons and glia contain 
mitochondrial MAO and cytoplasmic COMT. Inhibitors of 
these enzymes, such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine, 
are used clinically as antidepressants (see Box 6E). 
Once released, dopamine acts exclusively by activating G- 
protein-coupled receptors. One of these, the D, dopamine 
receptor, is shown in Figure 6.12A. The structure of this re- 
ceptor closely parallels that of other metabotropic receptors, 
such as the mACh receptor (see Figure 6.4A), except that its 
ligand binding site is optimized for binding to dopamine. 
Most dopamine receptor subtypes (see Figure 6.4C) act by 
either activating or inhibiting adenylyl cyclase (see Chap- 
ter 7). Activation of these receptors generally contributes to 
complex behaviors; for example, administration of dopamine 
receptor agonists causes hyperactivity and repetitive, stereo- 
typed behavior in laboratory animals. Activation of another 
type of dopamine receptor in the medulla inhibits vomiting. 
Thus, antagonists of these receptors are used as emetics to 
induce vomiting after poisoning or a drug overdose. Dopa- 
mine receptor antagonists can also elicit catalepsy, a state in 
which it is difficult to initiate voluntary motor movement, 
suggesting a basis for this aspect of some psychoses. 
¢ Norepinephrine (also called noradrenaline) is used as a 
neurotransmitter in the locus coeruleus, a brainstem nucleus 
that projects diffusely to a variety of forebrain targets (Figure 
6.11B) and influences sleep and wakefulness, attention, and 
feeding behavior. Perhaps the most prominent noradrener- 
gic neurons are sympathetic ganglion cells, which employ 
norepinephrine as the major peripheral transmitter in this 
division of the visceral motor system (see Chapter 21). 
Norepinephrine synthesis requires dopamine B-hydrox- 
ylase, which catalyzes the production of norepinephrine 
from dopamine (see Figure 6.10). Norepinephrine is then 
loaded into synaptic vesicles via the same VMAT involved

CHAPTER 6 
BOX 6F Addiction 
_ Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing 
_ disease with obvious medical, social, and 
_ political consequences. Addiction (also 
_ called substance dependence) is a persis- 
_ tent disorder of brain function in which 
compulsive drug use occurs despite seri- 
_ ous negative consequences for the afflict- 
_ ed individual. The diagnostic manual of 
_ the American Psychiatric Association 
defines addiction in terms of both physi- 
- cal dependence and psychological depen- 
dence (in which an individual continues 
_ the drug-taking behavior despite obvi- 
_ ously maladaptive consequences). 
The range of substances that can 
generate this sort of dependence is 
wide; the primary agents of abuse at 
present are opioids, cocaine, amphet- 
amines, marijuana, alcohol, and 
nicotine. Addiction to more "socially 
acceptable" agents such as alcohol and 
nicotine are sometimes regarded as less 
problematic, but in fact involve medical 
and behavioral consequences that are 
at least as great as for drugs of abuse 
that are considered more dangerous. 
Importantly, the phenomenon of addic- 
tion is not limited to human behavior, 
but is demonstrable in laboratory ani- 
mals. Primates, rodents, and other spe- 
cies will self-administer most of these 
same agents if they are provided with 
the opportunity to do so. 
In addition to a compulsion to take 
the agent of abuse, a major feature of 
addiction for many drugs is a constel- 
lation of negative physiological and 
emotional features, loosely referred to 
as "withdrawal syndrome," that occur 
when the drug is not taken. The signs 
and symptoms of withdrawal are differ- 
ent for each agent of abuse, but in gen- 
eral are characterized by effects oppo- 
site those of the positive experience 
induced by the drug itself. Consider, as 
an example, cocaine, a drug that was 
estimated to be in regular use by 5-6 
million Americans during the 1990s, 
with about 600,000 regular users either 
addicted or at high risk for addiction. 
The positive effects of the drug smoked 
or inhaled as a powder in the form of 
the alkaloidal free base is a "high" that 
is nearly immediate but generally lasts 
only a few minutes, typically leading 
to a desire for additional drug in as 
little as 10 minutes to half an hour. The 
"high" is described as a feeling of well- 
being, self-confidence, and satisfaction. 
Conversely, when the drug is not avail- 
able, frequent users experience depres- 
sion, sleepiness, fatigue, drug-craving, 
and a general sense of malaise. 
Another aspect of addiction to cocaine 
or other agents is tolerance, defined as 
a reduction in the response to the drug 
upon repeated administration. Tolerance 
occurs as a consequence of persistent use 
of a number of drugs but is particularly 
significant in drug addiction, since it pro- 
gressively increases the dose needed to 
experience the desired effects. 
Although it is fair to say that the neu- 
robiology of addiction is incompletely 
understood, for cocaine and many other 
agents of abuse the addictive effects 
involve activation of dopamine receptors 
in critical brain regions involved in moti- 
vation and emotional reinforcement (see 
Chapter 29). The most important of these 
areas is the midbrain dopamine system, 
especially its projections from the ventral- 
tegmental area to the nucleus acumbens. 
Agents such as cocaine appear to act by 
raising dopamine levels in these areas, 
making this transmitter more available to 
receptors by interfering with re-uptake 
of synaptically released dopamine by the 
dopamine transporter. The reinforcement 
and motivation of drug-taking behaviors 
is thought to be related to the projections 
to the nucleus acumbens. 
The most common opioid drug of 
abuse is heroin. Heroin is a derivative 
of the opium poppy and is not legally 
available for clinical purposes in the 
United States. The number of heroin 
addicts in the United States is estimated 
to be between 750,000 and a million 
individuals. The positive feelings pro- 
duced by heroin, generally described 
as the "rush," are often compared to 
the feeling of sexual orgasm and begin 
in less than a minute after intravenous 
injection. There is then a feeling of 
general well-being (referred to as "on 
the nod") that lasts about an hour, 
The symptoms of withdrawal can be 
intense; these are restlessness, irritabil- 
ity, nausea, muscle pain, depression, 
sleeplessness, and a sense of anxiety 
) 
and malaise. The reinforcing aspects of 
the drug entail the same dopaminergic 
circuitry in the ventral tegmental area 
and nucleus acumbens as does cocaine, 
although additional areas are certainly 
involved, particularly the sites 
of opioid 
receptors described in Chapter 10. 
Interestingly, addiction to heroin 
or any other agent is not an inevitable 
consequence of drug use, but depends 
critically on the environment. For 
instance, returning veterans who were 
heroin addicts in Vietnam typically lost 
their addiction upon returning to the 
United States. Likewise, patients given 
other opioids (e.g., morphine) for pain- 
ful conditions rarely become addicts. 
The treatment of any form of addic- 
tion is difficult and must be tailored to 
the circumstances of the individual. In 
addition to treating acute problems of 
withdrawal and "detoxification," pat- 
terns of behavior must be changed that 
may take months or years. Addiction is 
thus a chronic disease state that requires 
continual monitoring during the lifetime 
of susceptible individuals.

Metabotropic receptors

for catecholamine neurotransmitters.

Like all metabotropic receptors, the D3 recep-

has a cytoplasmic domain that binds to and 
activates G proteins, as well as an extracellular 
domain that binds dopamine. (B) Structure of 
the B, adrenergic receptor and its associated

(Right) Binding of ligand (8 agonist, indicated

the a subunit of the G protein, which in turn 
induces a dramatic change in the structure of 
this subunit. (A from Chien et al., 2010; B from 
Wall et al., 1995, Rasmussen et al., 2007, and 
Rasmussen et al., 2011.) 
binding site 
in vesicular dopamine transport. Norepinephrine is cleared 
from the synaptic cleft by the norepinephrine transporter 
(NET), a Na*-dependent co-transporter that also is capable 
of taking up dopamine. As mentioned, NET is a molecu- 
lar target of amphetamine, which acts as a stimulant by 
producing a net increase in the release of norepinephrine 
and dopamine. A mutation in the NET gene is a cause of 
orthostatic intolerance, a disorder that produces lighthead- 
edness while standing up. Like dopamine, norepinephrine 
is degraded by MAO and COMT. 
Both norepinephrine and epinephrine act on a- and 
®-adrenergic receptors (see Figure 6.4C). Both types of 
receptor are G-protein-coupled; in fact, the B-adrenergic 
receptor was the first identified metabotropic neurotrans- 
mitter receptor. As shown in Figure 6.12B, the structure of 
this receptor is very similar to other metabotropic receptors 
(such as the dopamine receptor in Figure 6.12A). Binding of 
norepinephrine or epinephrine causes small changes in the 
structure of this receptor, which permits the G protein to 
bind (Figure 6.12, right). This, in turn, causes larger changes 
in the shape of the a subunit of the G protein, the first step 
in a series of reactions that allow the G protein to regulate 
intracellular signaling cascades (see Chapter 7). 
Two subclasses of a-adrenergic receptors have been 
identified. Activation of a, receptors usually results in a 
slow depolarization linked to the inhibition of K* channels, 
while activation of a, receptors produces a slow hyper- 
polarization due to the activation of a different type of K* 
channel. There are three subtypes of B-adrenergic receptor,

two of which are expressed in many types of neurons. Ago- 
nists and antagonists of adrenergic receptors, such as the 
B-blocker propanolol (Inderol®), are used clinically for a 
variety of conditions ranging from cardiac arrhythmias to 
migraine headaches. However, most of the actions of these 
drugs are on smooth muscle receptors, particularly in the 
cardiovascular and respiratory systems (see Chapter 21). 
e¢ Epinephrine (also called adrenaline) is found in the brain 
at lower levels than the other catecholamines and also is 
present in fewer brain neurons than other catecholamines. 
Epinephrine-containing neurons in the central nervous 
system are primarily in the lateral tegmental system and in 
the medulla and project to the hypothalamus and thalamus 
(Figure 6.11C). The function of these epinephrine-secreting 
neurons is not known. 
The enzyme that synthesizes epinephrine, phenyleth- 
anolamine-N-methyltransferase (see Figure 6.10), is pres- 
ent only in epinephrine-secreting neurons. Otherwise, the 
metabolism of epinephrine is very similar to that of norepi- 
nephrine. Epinephrine is loaded into vesicles via the VMAT. 
No plasma membrane transporter specific for epinephrine 
has been identified, although the NET is capable of trans- 
porting epinephrine. As already noted, epinephrine acts on 
both a- and B-adrenergic receptors. 
e Histamine is found in neurons in the hypothalamus 
that send sparse but widespread projections to almost all 
regions of the brain and spinal cord (Figure 6.13A). The 
central histamine projections mediate arousal and atten- 
tion, similar to central ACh and norepinephrine projections.

of the cortex indicate the innervation of lateral cortical regions 
not shown in this midsagittal plane of section. 
Histamine also controls the reactivity of the vestibular sys- 
tem. Allergic reactions or tissue damage cause release of 
histamine from mast cells in the bloodstream. The close 
proximity of mast cells to blood vessels, together with the 
potent actions of histamine on blood vessels, raises the pos- 
sibility that histamine may influence brain blood flow. 
Histamine is produced from the amino acid histidine by 
a histidine decarboxylase (Figure 6.14A) and is transported 
into vesicles via the same VMAT as the catecholamines. No 
plasma membrane histamine transporter has been identi- 
fied yet. Histamine is degraded by the combined actions of 
histamine methyltransferase and MAO. 
The three known types of histamine receptors are all 
metabotropic receptors (see Figure 6.4C). Because of the 
role of histamine receptors in mediating allergic responses, 
many histamine receptor antagonists have been developed 
as antihistamine agents. Antihistamines that cross the 
blood-brain barrier, such as diphenhydramine (Benadry!®), 
act as sedatives by interfering with the roles of histamine in 
CNS arousal. Antagonists of the H, receptor also are used 
to prevent motion sickness, perhaps because of the role of 
histamine in controling vestibular function. H, receptors 
control the secretion of gastric acid in the digestive system, 
allowing H, receptor antagonists to be used in the treat- 
ment of a variety of upper gastrointestinal disorders (e.¢., 
peptic ulcers).

pons and upper brainstem, which have widespread pro- 
jections to the forebrain (Figure 6.13B) and regulate sleep 
and wakefulness (see Chapter 28). 5-HT occupies a place of 
prominence in neuropharmacology because a large number 
of antipsychotic drugs that are valuable in the treatment of 
depression and anxiety act on serotonergic pathways (see 
Box 6E). 
5-HT is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan, 
which is an essential dietary requirement. Tryptophan is 
taken up into neurons by a plasma membrane transporter 
and hydroxylated in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme 
tryptophan-5-hydroxylase (Figure 6.14B), the rate-limiting 
step for 5-HT synthesis. Loading of 5-HT into synaptic ves- 
icles is done by the VMAT that is also responsible for load- 
ing other monoamines into synaptic vesicles. The synaptic 
effects of serotonin are terminated by transport back into 
nerve terminals via a specific serotonin transporter (SERT). 
Many antidepressant drugs are selective serotonin reup- 
take inhibitors (SSRIs) that inhibit transport of 5-HT by 
SERT. Perhaps the best-known example of an SSRI is Pro- 
zac® (see Box 6E). The primary catabolic pathway for 5-HT 
is mediated by MAO. 
A large number of 5-HT receptors have been identified. 
Most 5-HT receptors are metabotropic (see Figure 6.4C). 
These have been implicated in behaviors, including the 
emotions, circadian rhythms, motor behaviors, and state 
of mental arousal. Impairments in the function of these 
receptors have been implicated in numerous psychiat- 
ric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and 
schizophrenia (see Chapter 29), and drugs acting on se- 
rotonin receptors are effective treatments for a number of 
these conditions. Activation of 5-HT receptors also medi- 
ates satiety and decreased food consumption, which is why 
serotonergic drugs are sometimes useful in treating eating 
disorders.

Only one group of serotonin receptors, the 5-HT, recep- 
tors, are ligand-gated ion channels (see Figure 6.3F). These 
are non-selective cation channels and therefore mediate 
excitatory postsynaptic responses. Their general structure, 
with functional channels formed by assembly of multiple 
subunits, is similar to the other ionotropic receptors de- 
scribed in this chapter. Two types of 5-HT, subunit are 
known; they form functional channels by assembling as a 
heteromultimer. 5-HT receptors are targets for a wide va- 
riety of therapeutic drugs including ondansetron (Zofran®) 
and granisetron (Kytril®), which are used to prevent post- 
operative nausea and chemotherapy-induced emesis. 
ATP and Other Purines 
All synaptic vesicles contain ATP, which is co-released with 
one or more "classical" neurotransmitters. This observation 
raises the possibility that ATP acts as a co-transmitter. It has 
been known since the 1920s that the extracellular applica- 
tion of ATP (or its breakdown products AMP and adenosine) 
can elicit electrical responses in neurons. The idea that some 
purines (so named because all these compounds contain a 
purine ring; see Figure 6.1) are also neurotransmitters is now 
well established. ATP acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter 
in motor neurons of the spinal cord, as well as in sensory 
and autonomic ganglia. Postsynaptic actions of ATP have also 
been demonstrated in the CNS, specifically for dorsal horn 
neurons and in a subset of hippocampal neurons. Extracel- 
lular enzymes degrade released ATP to adenosine, which has 
its own set of signaling actions. Thus, adenosine cannot be 
considered a classical neurotransmitter because it is not stored 
in synaptic vesicles or released in a Ca**-dependent manner. 
A number of enzymes, including apyrase, ecto-5' nucleotid- 
ase, and nucleoside transporters, are involved in the rapid ca- 
tabolism and removal of purines from extracellular locations. 
Receptors for both ATP and adenosine are widely dis- 
tributed in the nervous system as well as in many other tis- 
sues. Three classes of these purinergic receptors are known. 
One class consists of ionotropic receptors called P2X re- 
ceptors (see Figure 6.3F). The structure of these receptors 
is somewhat unique among ionotropic receptors because 
each subunit has only two transmembrane domains (Figure 
6.15A). Further, only three of these subunits are required to 
form a trimeric receptor (Figure 6.15B). Like all ionotropic 
receptors, a pore is located in the center of the P2X receptor 
and forms a nonselective cation channel. Thus, P2X recep- 
tors mediate excitatory postsynaptic responses. Ionotropic 
purinergic receptors are widely distributed in central and 
peripheral neurons. In sensory nerves, they evidently play 
a role in mechanosensation and pain; their function in most 
other cells, however, is not known. 
The other two classes of purinergic receptors are G-pro- 
tein-coupled metabotropic receptors (see Figure 6.4C). The 
two classes differ in their sensitivity to agonists—one type is 
preferentially stimulated by adenosine, whereas the other is 
preferentially activated by ATP. An example of the former, 
the A2A adenosine receptor, is shown in Figure 6.15D. Both 
receptor types are found throughout the brain, as well as in

peripheral tissues such as the heart, adipose tissue, and the 
kidney. Xanthines such as caffeine and theophylline block 
adenosine receptors, and this activity is thought to be re- 
sponsible for the stimulant effects of these agents. 
Peptide Neurotransmitters 
Many peptides known to be hormones also act as neu- 
rotransmitters. Some peptide transmitters have been im- 
plicated in modulating emotions (see Chapter 29). Others, 
such as substance P and the opioid peptides, are involved in 
the perception of pain (see Chapter 10). Still other peptides,

such as melanocyte-stimulating hormone, adrenocortico- 
tropin, and B-endorphin, regulate complex responses to 
stress, 
The mechanisms responsible for the synthesis and pack- 
aging of peptide transmitters are fundamentally different 
from those used for the small-molecule neurotransmit- 
ters and are much like the synthesis of proteins that are 
secreted from non-neuronal cells (pancreatic enzymes, for 
instance). Peptide-secreting neurons generally synthesize 
polypeptides that are much larger than the final, "mature" 
peptide. Processing these polypeptides, which are called 
pre-propeptides (or pre-proproteins), takes place within

the neuron's cell body by a sequence of reactions that oc- 
cur in several intracellular organelles. Pre-propeptides are 
synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where the 
signal sequence—that is, the sequence of amino acids indi- 
cating that the peptide is to be secreted—is removed. The 
remaining polypeptide, called a propeptide (or propro- 
tein), then traverses the Golgi apparatus and is packaged 
into vesicles in the trans-Golgi network. The final stages of 
peptide neurotransmitter processing occur after packaging 
into vesicles and involve proteolytic cleavage, modification 
of the ends of the peptide, glycosylation, phosphorylation, 
and disulfide bond formation. 
Propeptide precursors are typically larger than their ac- 
tive peptide products and can give rise to more than one 
species of neuropeptide (Figure 6.16), which means that 
multiple neuroactive peptides can be released from a single 
vesicle. In addition, neuropeptides often are co-released 
with small-molecule neurotransmitters. Thus, peptidergic 
synapses often elicit complex postsynaptic responses. Pep- 
tides are catabolized into inactive amino acid fragments by 
enzymes called peptidases, usually located on the extracel- 
lular surface of the plasma membrane. 
The biological activity of the peptide neurotransmitters 
depends on their amino acid sequence (Figure 6.17). Based 
on their sequences, neuropeptide transmitters have been 
loosely grouped into five categories: the brain/gut peptides; 
opioid peptides; pituitary peptides; hypothalamic releasing 
hormones; and a catch-all category containing other, not 
easily classified, peptides. 
The study of neuropeptides began more than 60 years 
ago with the accidental discovery of substance P (Figure 
6.17A), a powerful hypotensive agent and an example of the 
first category of peptide. (The peculiar name derives from 
the fact that this molecule was an unidentified component 
of powder extracts from brain and intestine.) Substance P 
is an 11-amino-acid peptide present in high concentra- 
tions in the human hippocampus, neocortex, and also in 
the gastrointestinal tract; hence its classification as a brain/ 
gut peptide. It is also released from C fibers (see Table 9.1), 
the small-diameter afferents in peripheral nerves that con- 
vey information about pain and temperature (as well as 
postganglionic autonomic signals). Substance P is a sen- 
sory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord, where its release 
can be inhibited by opioid peptides released from spinal 
cord interneurons, resulting in the suppression of pain (see 
Chapter 10). The diversity of neuropeptides is highlighted 
by the finding that the gene coding for substance P encodes 
a number of other neuroactive peptides, including neuroki- 
nin A, neuropeptide K, and neuropeptide y. 
An especially important category of peptide neurotrans- 
mitters is the family of opioids (Figure 6.17B), so named 
because they bind to the same postsynaptic receptors that 
are activated by opium. The opium poppy has been culti- 
vated for some 5000 years, and its derivatives have been

used as an analgesic since at least the Renaissance. The ac- 
tive ingredients in opium are a variety of plant alkaloids, 
predominantly morphine. Morphine, named for Morpheus, 
the Greek god of dreams, is still in use today and is one 
of the most effective analgesics, despite its addictive po- 
tential (see Box 6F). Synthetic opiates such as meperidine 
and methadone are also powerful analgesics, and fentanyl, 
a synthetic opiate with 80 times the analgesic potency of 
morphine, is widely used in clinical anesthesiology. 
The opioid peptides were discovered in the 1970s dur- 
ing a search for endorphins— endogenous compounds that 
mimicked the actions of morphine. It was hoped that such 
compounds would be analgesics, and that understanding 
them would shed light on drug addiction. The endogenous 
ligands of the opioid receptors have now been identified as 
a family of more than 20 opioid peptides that fall into three 
classes: the endorphins, the enkephalins, and the dynor- 
phins (Table 6.2). Each of these classes are liberated from 
an inactive pre-propeptide (pre-proopiomelanocortin, pre- 
proenkephalin A, and pre-prodynorphin) derived from dis- 
tinct genes (see Figure 6.16). Opioid precursor processing is 
carried out by tissue-specific processing enzymes that are 
packaged into vesicles, along with the precursor peptide, in 
the Golgi apparatus. 
Opioid peptides are widely distributed throughout the 
brain and are often co-localized with other small-molecule 
neurotransmitters, such as GABA and 5-HT. In general, the 
opioids tend to be depressants. When injected intracere- 
brally in experimental animals, they act as analgesics; on the 
basis of this and other evidence, opioids are likely to be in- 
volved in the mechanisms underlying acupuncture-induced

analgesia. Opioids are also involved in complex behaviors 
such as sexual attraction and aggressive/submissive behav- 
iors. They have also been implicated in psychiatric disorders 
such as schizophrenia and autism, although the evidence 
for this is debated. Unfortunately, repeated administration 
of opioids leads to tolerance and addiction. 
Virtually all neuropeptides initiate their effects by ac- 
tivating G-protein-coupled receptors. The study of these 
metabotropic peptide receptors in the brain has been dif- 
ficult because few specific agonists and antagonists are 
known. Peptides activate their receptors at low (nM to uM) 
concentrations compared to the concentrations required to 
activate receptors for small-molecule neurotransmitters. 
These properties allow the postsynaptic targets of peptides 
to be quite far removed from presynaptic terminals and to 
modulate the electrical properties of neurons that are sim- 
ply in the vicinity of the site of peptide release. Neuropep- 
tide receptor activation is especially important in regulating 
the postganglionic output from sympathetic ganglia and the 
activity of the gut (see Chapter 21). Peptide receptors, par- 
ticularly the neuropeptide Y receptor, are also implicated in 
the initiation and maintenance of feeding behavior leading 
to satiety or obesity. 
Other behaviors ascribed to peptide receptor activation 
include anxiety and panic attacks, and antagonists of cho- 
lecystokinin receptors are clinically useful in the treatment 
of these afflictions. Other useful drugs have been developed 
by targeting the opioid receptors. Three well defined opioid 
receptor subtypes (u, §, and «) play a role in reward mecha- 
nisms as well as addiction. The -opioid receptor has been 
specifically identified as the primary site for drug reward 
mediated by opiate drugs. 
Unconventional Neurotransmitters 
In addition to the conventional neurotransmitters already 
described, some unusual molecules are used for signal- 
ing between neurons and their targets. These chemical 
signals can be considered as neurotransmitters because 
of their roles in interneuronal signaling and because their 
release from neurons is regulated by Ca**. However, they 
are unconventional in comparison to other neurotransmit- 
ters because they are not stored in synaptic vesicles and 
are not released from presynaptic terminals via exocytotic 
mechanisms. In fact, these unconventional neurotransmit- 
ters need not be released from presynaptic terminals at all 
and are often associated with retrograde signaling (that is, 
from postsynaptic cells back to presynaptic terminals). 
e Endocannabinoids are a family of related endogenous 
signals that interact with cannabinoid receptors. These re- 
ceptors are the molecular targets of A'-tetrahydrocannab- 
inol, the psychoactive component of the marijuana plant, 
Cannabis (Box 6G). While some members of this emerging 
group of chemical signals remain to be determined, anan- 
damide and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) have been estab- 
lished as endocannabinoids. These signals are unsaturated 
fatty acids with polar head groups and are produced by en- 
zymatic degradation of membrane lipids (Figure 6.18A,B). 
Production of endocannabinoids is stimulated by a second 
messenger within postsynaptic neurons, typically a rise 
in postsynaptic Ca** concentration. Although the mecha- 
nism of endocannabinoid release is not entirely clear, it is 
likely that these hydrophobic signals diffuse through the 
postsynaptic membrane to reach cannabinoid receptors on 
other nearby cells. Endocannabinoid action is terminated 
by carrier-mediated transport of these signals back into the

Medicinal use of the marijuana plant, 
Cannabis sativa (Figure A), dates back 
thousands of years. Ancient civiliza- 
tions—including both Greek and 
Roman societies in Europe, as well as 
Indian and Chinese cultures in Asia— 
appreciated that this plant was capable 
of producing relaxation, euphoria, and 
a number of other psychopharmaco- 
logical actions. In more recent times, 
medicinal use of marijuana has largely 
subsided (although it remains useful 
in relieving the symptoms of terminal 
cancer patients); the recreational use 
of marijuana (Figure B) has become 
so popular that some societies have 
decriminalized its use. 
Understanding the brain mecha- 
nisms underlying the actions of 
marijuana was advanced by the 
discovery that a cannabinoid, 
A'-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; Figure 
C), is the active component of mari- 
juana. This finding led to the develop- 
ment of synthetic derivatives, such as

WIN 55,212-2 and rimonabant (see 
Figure 6.18), that have served as valu- 
able tools for probing the brain actions 
of THC. Of particular interest is that 
receptors for these cannabinoids exist in 
the brain and exhibit marked regional 
variations in distribution, being espe- 
cially enriched in the brain areas—such 
as substantia nigra and caudate puta- 
men—that have been implicated in 
drug abuse (Figure D). The presence of 
these brain receptors for cannabinoids 
led in turn to a search for endogenous 
cannabinoid compounds in the brain, 
culiminating in the discovery of endo- 
cannabinoids such as 2-AG and anan- 
damide (see Figure 6.18). This path of 
discovery closely parallels the identifi- 
cation of endogenous opioid peptides, 
which resulted from the search for 
endogenous morphine-like compounds 
in the brain (see text and Table 6.2). 
Given that THC interacts with brain 
endocannabinoid receptors, particularly 
the CB1 receptor, it is likely that such

actions are responsible for the behav- 
ioral consequences of marijuana use. 
Indeed, many of the well-documented 
effects of marijuana are consistent with 
the distribution and actions of brain 
CB1 receptors. For example, marijuana 
effects on perception could be due to 
CB1 receptors in the neocortex, effects 
on psychomotor control due to endo- 
cannabinoid receptors in the basal 
ganglia and cerebellum, effects on 
short-term memory due to cannabinoid 
receptors in the hippocampus, and 
the well-known effects of marijuana 
on stimulating appetite due to hypo- 
thalamic actions. While formal links 
between these behavioral consequences 
of marijuana and the underlying brain 
mechanisms are still being forged, 
studies of the actions of this drug have 
shed substantial light on basic synaptic 
mechanisms, which promise to further 
elucidate the mode of action of one of 
the world's most popular drugs.

At least two types of cannabinoid receptor have been 
identified, with most actions of endocannabinoids in the 
CNS mediated by the CB1 type. The CB1 receptor is a G- 
protein-coupled receptor related to the metabotropic re- 
ceptors for ACh, glutamate, and other conventional neu- 
rotransmitters. Several compounds that are structurally 
related to endocannabinoids and that bind to the CB1 re- 
ceptor have been synthesized (Figure 6.18C). These com- 
pounds act as agonists or antagonists of the CB1 receptor 
and serve both as tools for elucidating the physiological 
functions of endocannabinoids and as targets for develop- 
ing therapeutically useful drugs. 
Endocannabinoids participate in several forms of synap- 
tic regulation. The best documented action of these agents 
is the inhibition of communication between postsynaptic 
target cells and their presynaptic inputs. In both the hip- 
pocampus and the cerebellum (among other brain regions), 
endocannabinoids serve as retrograde signals that regulate 
GABA release at certain inhibitory terminals. At such syn- 
apses, depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron causes a 
transient reduction in inhibitory postsynaptic responses 
(Figure 6.19). Depolarization reduces synaptic transmission 
by elevating the concentration of Ca?* within the postsyn- 
aptic neuron. This rise in Ca** triggers synthesis and release 
of endocannabinoids from the postsynaptic cells. The endo- 
cannabinoids then make their way to the presynaptic termi- 
nals and bind to CB1 receptors on these terminals. Activa- 
tion of CB1 receptors inhibits the amount of GABA released 
in response to presynaptic action potentials, thereby reduc- 
ing inhibitory transmission. The mechanisms responsible 
for the reduction in GABA release are not entirely clear,

postsynaptic depolarization lasts a few seconds and is mediated

nabinoid receptor antagonist rimonabant. (B,C after Ohno-

but probably involve effects on voltage-gated Ca** channels 
and/or K* channels in the presynaptic neurons. 
Nitric oxide (NO) is an unusual but especially interest- 
ing chemical signal. It is a gas produced by the action of 
nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme that converts the amino 
acid arginine into a metabolite (citrulline) and simultane- 
ously generates NO (Figure 6.20). Within neurons, NO syn- 
thase is regulated by Ca** binding to the Ca** sensor protein 
calmodulin (see Chapter 7). Once produced, NO can per- 
meate the plasma membrane, meaning that NO generated 
inside one cell can travel through the extracellular medium 
and act inside nearby cells. Thus, this gaseous signal has 
a range of influence that extends well beyond the cell of 
origin, diffusing a few tens of micrometers from its site of 
production before it is degraded. This property makes NO 
a potentially useful agent for coordinating the activities of 
multiple cells in a localized region and may mediate cer- 
tain forms of synaptic plasticity that spread within small 
networks of neurons. 
All of the known actions of NO are mediated within its 
cellular targets; for this reason, NO often is considered a 
second messenger rather than a neurotransmitter. Some of 
the actions of NO are due to the activation of the enzyme 
guanylyl cyclase, which then produces the second messen- 
ger cGMP within target cells (See Chapter 7). Other ac- 
tions of NO are the result of covalent modification of target 
proteins via nitrosylation, the addition of a nitryl group to 
selected amino acids within the proteins. NO decays spon- 
taneously by reacting with oxygen to produce inactive ni- 
trogen oxides; thus, its signals last for only a short time 
(seconds or less). NO signaling evidently regulates a variety 
of synapses that also employ conventional neurotransmit- 
ters; so far, presynaptic terminals that release glutamate are

NO may also be involved in some neurological diseases. For 
example, it has been proposed that an imbalance between 
nitric oxide and superoxide generation underlies some neu- 
rodegenerative diseases. 
Summary 
The complex synaptic computations occurring at neural cir- 
cuits throughout the brain arise from the actions of a large 
number of neurotransmitters, which act on an even larger 
number of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors. Gluta- 
mate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, 
whereas GABA and glycine are the major inhibitory neu- 
rotransmitters. The actions of these small-molecule neu- 
rotransmitters are typically faster than those of the neuro- 
peptides. Thus, most small-molecule transmitters mediate 
synaptic transmission when a rapid response is essential, 
whereas the neuropeptide transmitters, as well as the bio- 
genic amines and some small-molecule neurotransmitters, 
tend to modulate ongoing activity in the brain or in pe- 
ripheral target tissues in a more gradual and ongoing way. 
Two broadly different families of neurotransmitter recep- 
tors have evolved to carry out the postsynaptic signaling 
actions of neurotransmitters. Ionotropic or ligand-gated ion 
channels combine the neurotransmitter receptor and ion 
channel in one molecular entity, and therefore give rise to 
rapid postsynaptic electrical responses. Metabotropic re- 
ceptors regulate the activity of postsynaptic ion channels 
indirectly, usually via G-proteins, and induce slower and 
longer-lasting electrical responses. Metabotropic recep- 
tors are especially important in regulating behavior, and 
drugs targeting these receptors have been clinically valu- 
able in treating a wide range of behavioral disorders. The

postsynaptic response at a given synapse is determined by 
the combination of receptor subtypes, G-protein subtypes, 
and ion channels that are expressed in the postsynaptic 
cell. Because each of these features can vary both within 
and among neurons, a tremendous diversity of transmitter- 
mediated effects is possible. Drugs that influence transmit- 
ter actions have enormous importance in the treatment of 
neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as in a broad 
spectrum of other medical problems.

Overview 
ELECTRICAL AND CHEMICAL SIGNALING MECHANISMS allow one nerve cell 
to receive and transmit information to another. This chapter focuses on the related 
events within neurons and other cells that are triggered by the interaction of a chemi- 
cal signal with its receptor. This intracellular processing typically begins when extra- 
cellular chemical signals (such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and trophic factors) 
bind to specific receptors located either on the surface or within the cytoplasm or 
nucleus of the target cells. Such binding activates the receptors and in so doing 
stimulates cascades of intracellular reactions involving GTP-binding proteins, second 
messenger molecules, protein kinases, ion channels, and many other effector pro- 
teins whose modulation temporarily changes the physiological state of the target cell. 
These same intracellular signal transduction pathways can also cause longer lasting 
changes by altering the transcription of genes, thus affecting the protein composition 
of the target cells on a more permanent basis. The large number of components in- 
volved in intracellular signaling pathways allows precise temporal and spatial control 
over the function of individual neurons, thereby allowing the coordination of electri- 
cal and chemical activity in the related populations of neurons that comprise neural 
circuits and systems. 
Strategies of Molecular Signaling 
Chemical communication coordinates the behavior of individual nerve and glial cells in 
physiological processes that range from neural differentiation to learning and memory. 
Indeed, molecular signaling ultimately mediates and modulates all brain functions. To 
carry out such communication, a series of extraordinarily diverse and complex chemical 
signaling pathways has evolved. The preceding chapters have described in some detail 
the electrical signaling mechanisms that allow neurons to generate action potentials for 
conduction of information. These chapters also described synaptic transmission, a spe- 
cial form of chemical signaling that transfers information from one neuron to another. 
But chemical signaling is not limited to synapses. Other well-characterized forms of 
chemical communication include paracrine signaling, which acts over a longer range 
than synaptic transmission and involves the secretion of chemical signals onto a group

CHAPTER 7 
of nearby target cells, and endocrine signaling, which refers 
to the secretion of hormones into the bloodstream, where 
they can affect targets throughout the body (Figure 7.1). 
Chemical signaling of any sort requires three compo- 
nents: a molecular signal that transmits information from 
one cell to another; a receptor molecule that transduces the 
information provided by the signal; and a target molecule 
that mediates the cellular response (see Figure 7.1A). The 
part of this process that takes place within the confines of 
the target cell is called intracellular signal transduction. 
A good example of transduction in the context of intercel- 
lular communication is the sequence of events triggered by 
chemical synaptic transmission (see Figure 7.1B and Chap- 
ter 5): neurotransmitters serve as the signal, neurotrans- 
mitter receptors serve as the transducing receptor, and the 
target molecule is an ion channel that is altered to cause the 
electrical response of the postsynaptic cell. In many cases, 
however, synaptic transmission activates additional intra- 
cellular pathways that have a variety of functional conse- 
quences. For example, the binding of the neurotransmitter

(A) The essential components of 
chemical signaling are: cells that 
initiate the process by releasing

target molecules; and subsequent 
cellular responses. (B) Forms of chemi- 
cal communication include synaptic 
transmission, paracrine signaling, and 
endocrine signaling. 
norepinephrine to its receptor activates GTP-binding pro- 
teins, which produces second messengers within the post- 
synaptic target, activates enzyme cascades, and eventually 
changes the chemical properties of numerous target mol- 
ecules within the affected cell. 
A general advantage of chemical signaling in both inter- 
cellular and intracellular contexts is signal amplification. 
Amplification occurs because individual signaling reactions 
can generate a much larger number of molecular products 
than the number of molecules that initiate the reaction. In 
the case of norepinephrine signaling, for example, a single 
norepinephrine molecule binding to its receptor can gener- 
ate many thousands of second messenger molecules (such 
as cyclic AMP), yielding an amplification of tens of thou- 
sands of phosphates transferred to target proteins (Figure 
7.2). Similar amplification occurs in all signal transduction 
pathways. Because the transduction processes often are 
mediated by a sequential set of enzymatic reactions, each 
with its own amplification factor, a small number of sig- 
nal molecules ultimately can activate a very large number 
of target molecules. Such amplification guarantees that a 
physiological response is evoked in the face of other, po- 
tentially countervailing, influences. 
Another rationale for these complex signal transduction 
schemes is that they permit precise control of cell behav- 
ior over a wide range of times. Some molecular interactions 
allow information to be transferred rapidly, while others 
are slower and longer lasting. For example, the signaling 
cascades associated with synaptic transmission at neuro- 
muscular junctions allow a person to respond to rapidly 
changing cues such as the trajectory of a pitched ball, while 
the slower responses triggered by adrenal medullary hor- 
mones (epinephrine and norepinephrine) secreted during 
a challenging game produce slower and longer-lasting ef- 
fects on muscle metabolism (see Chapter 21) and emotional 
state (see Chapter 29). To encode information that varies so

cells. These activated proteins can bind 
to other signaling molecules, such 
as the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Each 
activated enzyme molecule generates 
a large number of cAMP molecules. 
cAMP binds to and activates another 
family of enzymes—the protein 
kinases—that can phosphorylate many 
target proteins. Although not every

amplification, overall the cascade

widely over time, the concentration of the relevant signaling 
molecules must be carefully controlled. On one hand, the 
concentration of every signaling molecule within the signal- 
ing cascade must return to subthreshold values before the 
arrival of another stimulus. On the other hand, keeping the 
intermediates in a signaling pathway activated is critical for 
a sustained response. Having multiple levels of molecular 
interactions facilitates the intricate timing of these events. 
The Activation of Signaling Pathways 
The molecular components of these signal transduction path- 
ways are always activated by a chemical signaling molecule.

cell-impermeant, cell-permeant, and cell-associated sig-

creted molecules and thus can act on target cells removed 
from the site of signal synthesis or release. Cell-impermeant 
signaling molecules typically bind to receptors associated 
with cell membranes. Hundreds of secreted molecules have 
now been identified, including the neurotransmitters dis- 
cussed in Chapter 6; proteins such as neurotrophic factors 
(see Chapter 23); and peptide hormones such as glucagon, 
insulin, and various reproductive hormones. These signal- 
ing molecules are typically short-lived, either because they 
are rapidly metabolized or because they are internalized by 
endocytosis once bound to their receptors.

(B) Cell-permeant molecules are able to cross 
the plasma membrane and bind to receptors 
in the cytoplasm or nucleus of target cells. 
(C) Cell-associated molecules are presented 
on the extracellular surface of the plasma 
membrane. These signals activate receptors 
on target cells only if they are directly adjacent 
to the signaling cell.

CHAPTER 7 
Cell-permeant signaling molecules can cross the plasma 
membrane to act directly on receptors that are inside the 
cell. Examples include numerous steroid (glucocorticoids, 
estradiol, and testosterone) and thyroid (thyroxin) hor- 
mones, and retinoids. These signaling molecules are rela- 
tively insoluble in aqueous solutions and are often trans- 
ported in blood and other extracellular fluids by binding to 
specific carrier proteins. In this form, they may persist in the 
bloodstream for hours or even days. 
The third group of chemical signaling molecules, cell- 
associated signaling molecules, are arrayed on the extra- 
cellular surface of the plasma membrane. As a result, these 
molecules act only on other cells that are physically in con- 
tact with the cell that carries such signals. Examples include 
proteins such as the integrins and neural cell adhesion mol- 
ecules (NCAMs) that influence axonal growth (see Chap- 
ter 23). Membrane-bound signaling molecules are more

difficult to study, but are clearly important in neuronal de- 
velopment and other circumstances where physical contact 
between cells provides information about cellular identities. 
Receptor Types 
Regardless of the nature of the initiating signal, cellular re- 
sponses are determined by the presence of receptors that 
specifically bind the signaling molecules. Binding of signal 
molecules causes a conformational change in the recep- 
tor, which then triggers the subsequent signaling cascade 
within the affected cell. Given that chemical signals can act 
either at the plasma membrane or within the cytoplasm (or 
nucleus) of the target cell, it is not surprising that recep- 
tors are actually found on both sides of the plasma mem- 
brane. The receptors for impermeant signal molecules are 
membrane-spanning proteins. The extracellular domain of 
such receptors includes the binding site for 
the signal, while the intracellular domain 
activates intracellular signaling cascades 
after the signal binds. A large number of 
these receptors have been identified and 
are grouped into families defined by the 
mechanism used to transduce signal bind- 
ing into a cellular response (Figure 7.4). 
Channel-linked receptors (also called 
ee 
ligand-gated ion channels) have the re- 
\ Si 
ceptor and transducing functions as part 
of the chemical signal with the binding 
site of the receptor causes the opening or 
closing of an ion channel pore in another 
part of the same molecule. The resulting 
ion flux changes the membrane potential 
of the target cell and, in some cases, can 
also lead to entry of Ca** ions that serve 
as a second messenger signal within the 
cell. Good examples of such receptors are 
the ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors 
described in Chapter 6.

Enzyme-linked receptors also have an extracellular 
binding site for chemical signals. The intracellular domain 
of such receptors is an enzyme whose catalytic activity is 
regulated by the binding of an extracellular signal. The great 
majority of these receptors are protein kinases, often ty- 
rosine kinases, that phosphorylate intracellular target pro- 
teins, thereby changing the physiological function of the 
target cells. Noteworthy members of this group of receptors 
are the Trk family of neurotrophin receptors (see Chapter 
23) and other receptors for growth factors. 
G-protein-coupled receptors regulate intracellular re- 
actions by an indirect mechanism involving an intermediate 
transducing molecule, called the GTP-binding proteins 
(or G-proteins). Because these receptors all share the struc- 
tural feature of crossing the plasma membrane seven times, 
they are also referred to as 7-transmembrane receptors (or 
metabotropic receptors; see Chapter 5). Hundreds of dif- 
ferent G-protein-linked receptors have been identified. 
Well-known examples include the B-adrenergic receptor, 
the muscarinic type of acetylcholine receptor, and metabo- 
tropic glutamate receptors discussed in Chapter 6, as well 
as the receptors for odorants in the olfactory system, and 
many types of receptors for peptide hormones. Rhodopsin, 
a light-sensitive, 7-transmembrane protein in retinal pho- 
toreceptors, is another form of G-protein-linked receptor 
whose signal is light photons (see Figure 11.9). 
Intracellular receptors are activated by cell-permeant 
or lipophilic signaling molecules (Figure 7.4D). Many of 
these receptors lead to the activation of signaling cascades 
that produce new mRNA and protein within the target cell. 
Often such receptors comprise a receptor protein bound to

an inhibitory protein complex. When the signaling molecule 
binds to the receptor, the inhibitory complex dissociates to 
expose a DNA-binding domain on the receptor. This acti- 
vated form of the receptor can then move into the nucleus 
and directly interact with nuclear DNA, resulting in altered 
transcription. Some intracellular receptors are located pri- 
marily in the cytoplasm, while others are in the nucleus. 
In either case, once these receptors are activated they can 
affect gene expression by altering DNA transcription. 
G-Proteins and Their 
Molecular Targets 
Both G-protein-coupled receptors and enzyme-linked 
receptors can activate biochemical reaction cascades that 
ultimately modify the function of target proteins. For both 
of these receptor types, the coupling between receptor ac- 
tivation and their subsequent effects are the GTP-binding 
proteins. There are two general classes of GTP-binding 
proteins (Figure 7.5). Heterotrimeric G-proteins are 
FIGURE 7.5 
Types of GTP-binding proteins. (A) Heterotri- 
meric G-proteins are composed of three distinct subunits (a, 6, 
and y). Receptor activation causes the binding of the G-protein and 
the a subunit to exchange GDP for GTP, leading to a dissociation 
of the a and By subunits. The biological actions of these G-proteins 
are terminated by hydrolysis of GTP, which is enhanced by GTPase- 
activating (GAP) proteins. (B) Monomeric G-proteins use similar 
mechanisms to relay signals from activated cell surface receptors 
to intracellular targets. Binding of GTP stimulates the biological 
actions of these G-proteins, and their activity is terminated by 
hydrolysis of GTP, which is also regulated by GAP proteins.

composed of three distinct subunits (a, B, and y). There 
are many different a, 8, and y subunits, allowing a bewil- 
dering number of G-protein permutations. Regardless of 
the specific composition of the heterotrimeric G-protein, 
its a subunit binds to guanine nucleotides, either GTP or 
GDP. Binding of GDP then allows the a subunit to bind 
to the 8 and y subunits to form an inactive trimer. Binding 
of an extracellular signal to a G-protein-coupled receptor 
in turn allows the G-protein to bind to the receptor and 
causes GDP to be replaced with GTP (Figure 7.5A). When 
GTP is bound to the G-protein, the a subunit dissociates 
from the By complex and activates the G-protein. Following 
activation, both the GTP-bound @ subunit and the free By 
complex can bind to downstream effector molecules that 
mediate a variety of responses in the target cell. 
The second class of GTP-binding proteins are the mo- 
nomeric G-proteins (also called small G-proteins). These 
monomeric GTPases also relay signals from activated cell 
surface receptors to intracellular targets such as the cyto- 
skeleton and the vesicle trafficking apparatus of the cell. 
The first small G-protein was discovered in a virus that 
causes rat sarcoma tumors and was therefore called ras. 
Ras is a molecule that helps regulate cell differentiation and 
proliferation by relaying signals from receptor kinases to the 
nucleus; the viral form of ras is defective, which accounts for 
the ability of the virus to cause the uncontrolled cell prolif- 
eration that leads to tumors. Ras is known to be involved 
in many forms of neuronal signaling, including long-term

synaptic potentiation (see Chapter 8). Since the discovery of 
ras, a large number of small GTPases have been identified 
and can be sorted into five different subfamilies with dif- 
ferent functions. For instance, some are involved in vesicle 
trafficking in the presynaptic terminal or elsewhere in the 
neuron, while others play a central role in protein and RNA 
trafficking in and out of the nucleus. 
Termination of signaling by both heterotrimeric and 
monomeric G-proteins is determined by hydrolysis of 
GTP to GDP. The rate of GTP hydrolysis is an important 
property of a particular G-protein that can be regulated by 
other proteins, termed GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). 
By replacing GTP with GDP, GAPs return G-proteins to 
their inactive form. GAPs were first recognized as regula- 
tors of small G-proteins, but recently similar proteins have 
been found to regulate the a subunits of heterotrimeric G- 
proteins. Hence, monomeric and trimeric G-proteins func- 
tion as molecular timers that are active in their GTP-bound 
state, becoming inactive when they have hydrolyzed the 
bound GTP to GDP (Figure 7.5B). 
Activated G-proteins alter the function of many down- 
stream effectors. Most of these effectors are enzymes 
FIGURE 7.6 
Effector pathways associated with G-protein- 
coupled receptors. In all three examples shown here, binding 
of a neurotransmitter to such a receptor leads to activation of 
a G-protein and subsequent recruitment of second messenger 
pathways. G., G, and G refer to three different types of heterotri- 
meric G-proteins.

that produce intracellular second messengers. Effector en- 
zymes include adenylyl cyclase, guanylyl cyclase, phospho- 
lipase C, and others (Figure 7.6). The second messengers 
produced by these enzymes trigger the complex biochemi- 
cal signaling cascades discussed in the next section. Because 
each of these cascades is activated by specific G-protein 
subunits, the pathways activated by a particular receptor 
are determined by the specific identity of the G-protein 
subunits associated with it. 
As well as activating effector molecules, G-proteins can 
also directly bind to and activate ion channels. For exam- 
ple, some neurons, as well as heart muscle cells, have G- 
protein-coupled receptors that bind acetylcholine. Because 
these receptors are also activated by the agonist muscarine, 
they are usually called muscarinic receptors (see Chapters 
6 and 21). Activation of muscarinic receptors can open K* 
channels, thereby inhibiting the rate at which the neurons 
fire action potentials, or slowing the beating of cardiac 
muscle. These inhibitory responses are believed to be the 
result of By subunits of G-proteins binding to the K* chan- 
nels. The activation of a subunits can also lead to the rapid 
closing of voltage-gated Ca** and Na* channels. Because 
these channels carry inward currents involved in generating 
action potentials, closing them makes it more difficult for 
target cells to fire (see Chapters 3 and 4). 
In summary, the binding of chemical signals to their re- 
ceptors activates cascades of signal transduction events in 
the cytosol of target cells. Within such cascades, G-proteins 
serve a pivotal function as the molecular transducing ele- 
ments that couple membrane receptors to their molecular 
effectors within the cell. The diversity of G-proteins and 
their downstream targets leads to many types of physiologi- 
cal responses. By directly regulating the gating of ion chan- 
nels, G-proteins can influence the membrane potential of 
target cells. 
Second Messengers 
Neurons use many different second messengers as intra- 
cellular signals. These messengers differ in the mechanism 
by which they are produced and removed, as well as their 
downstream targets and effects (Figure 7.7A). This section 
summarizes the attributes of some of the principal second 
messengers. 
¢ Calcium. The calcium ion (Ca?*) is perhaps the most 
common intracellular messenger in neurons. Indeed, few 
neuronal functions are immune to the influence—direct or 
indirect—of Ca2. In all cases, information is transmitted 
by a transient rise in the cytoplasmic calcium concentra- 
tion, which allows Ca?* to bind to a large number of Ca?*- 
binding proteins that serve as molecular targets. One of 
the most thoroughly studied targets of Ca'* is calmodulin, 
a Ca?+-binding protein abundant in the cytosol of all cells. 
Binding of Ca?* to calmodulin activates this protein, which 
MOLECULAR SIGNALING WITHIN NEURONS 
147 
then initiates its effects by binding to still other downstream 
targets, such as protein kinases. 
Ordinarily the concentration of Ca?* ions in the cyto- 
sol is extremely low, typically 50-100 nanomolar (10° M). 
The concentration of Ca** ions outside neurons—in the 
bloodstream or cerebrospinal fluid, for instance—is several 
orders of magnitude higher, typically several millimolar 
(10°M). This steep Ca** gradient is maintained by a num- 
ber of mechanisms (Figure 7.7B). Most important in this 
maintenance are two proteins that translocate Ca** from 
the cytosol to the extracellular medium: an ATPase called 
the calcium pump; and an Na*/Ca?* exchanger, which is 
a protein that replaces intracellular Ca** with extracellular 
sodium ions (see Chapter 4). In addition to these plasma 
membrane mechanisms, Ca** is also pumped into the en- 
doplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. These organelles 
can thus serve as storage depots of Ca'* ions that are later 
released to participate in signaling events. Finally, nerve 
cells contain other Ca**-binding proteins—such as calbi- 
ndin—that serve as Ca** buffers. Such buffers reversibly 
bind Ca** and thus blunt the magnitude and kinetics of Ca** 
signals within neurons. 
The Ca** ions that act as intracellular signals enter cyto- 
sol by means of one or more types of Ca**-permeable ion 
channels (see Chapter 4). These can be voltage-gated Ca** 
channels or ligand-gated channels in the plasma mem- 
brane, both of which allow Ca?* to flow down the Ca?* 
gradient and into the cell from the extracellular medium. 
In addition, other channels allow Ca** to be released from 
the interior of the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. 
These intracellular Ca**-releasing channels are gated, so 
they can be opened or closed in response to various intra- 
cellular signals. One such channel is the inositol trisphos- 
phate (IP,) receptor. As the name implies, these channels 
are regulated by IP,, a second messenger described in more 
detail below. A second type of intracellular Ca**-releasing 
channel is the ryanodine receptor, named after a drug that 
binds to and partially opens these receptors. Among the 
biological signals that activate ryanodine receptors are cy- 
toplasmic Ca** and, at least in muscle cells, depolarization 
of the plasma membrane. 
These various mechanisms for elevating and removing 
Ca** ions allow precise control of both the timing and loca- 
tion of Ca** signaling within neurons, which in turn permit 
Ca?* to control many different signaling events. For exam- 
ple, voltage-gated Ca** channels allow Ca** concentrations 
to rise very rapidly and locally within presynaptic terminals 
to trigger neurotransmitter release, as described in Chapter 
5. Slower and more widespread rises in Ca** concentration 
regulate a wide variety of other responses, including gene 
expression in the cell nucleus. 
© Cyclic nucleotides. Another important group of second 
messengers are the cyclic nucleotides, specifically cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine

monophosphate (cGMP) (Figure 7.7C). Cyclic AMP is a 
derivative of the common cellular energy storage molecule 
ATP, and is produced when G-proteins activate adenylyl 
cyclase in the plasma membrane. Adenylyl cyclase converts 
ATP into cAMP by removing two phosphate groups from the 
ATP. Cyclic GMP is similarly produced from GTP by the ac- 
tion of guanylyl cyclase. Once the intracellular concentration 
of cAMP or cGMP is elevated, these nucleotides can bind to 
two different classes of targets. The most common targets of 
cyclic nucleotide action are protein kinases, either the cAMP- 
dependent protein kinase (PKA) or the cGMP-dependent 
protein kinase (PKG). These enzymes mediate many physi- 
ological responses by phosphorylating target proteins, as 
described in the following section. In addition, cAMP and 
cGMP can bind to certain ligand-gated ion channels, thereby 
influencing neuronal signaling. These cyclic nucleotide-gated 
channels are particularly important in phototransduction and 
other sensory transduction processes, such as olfaction. Cy- 
clic nucleotide signals are degraded by phosphodiesterases, 
enzymes that cleave phosphodiester bonds and convert 
cAMP into AMP or cGMP into GMP. 
¢ Diacylglycerol and IP,. Remarkably, membrane lipids 
can also be converted into intracellular second messengers 
(Figure 7.7D). The two most important messengers of this 
type are produced from phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate 
(PIP,). This lipid component is cleaved by phospholipase

C, an enzyme activated by certain G-proteins and by cal- 
cium ions. Phospholipase C splits the PIP, into two smaller 
molecules, each of which acts as a second messenger. One 
of these messengers is diacylglycerol (DAG), a molecule 
that remains within the membrane and activates protein 
kinase C, which phosphorylates substrate proteins in both 
the plasma membrane and elsewhere. The other messenger 
is inositol trisphosphate (IP,), a molecule that leaves the 
cell membrane and diffuses within the cytosol. IP, binds to 
IP, receptors, channels that release calcium from the en- 
doplasmic reticulum. Thus, the action of IP, is to produce 
yet another second messenger (perhaps a third messenger, 
in this case!) that triggers a whole spectrum of reactions in 
the cytosol. The actions of DAG and IP, are terminated by 
enzymes that convert these two molecules into inert forms 
that can be recycled to produce new molecules of PIP,,. 
The intracellular concentration of these second messen- 
gers changes dynamically over time, allowing very precise 
control over their downstream targets. These signals can 
also be localized to small compartments within single cells 
or can spread over great distances, even spreading between 
cells via gap junctions (see Chapter 5). Understanding of 
the complex temporal and spatial dynamics of these second 
messenger signals has been greatly aided by the develop- 
ment of imaging techniques that visualize second messen- 
gers and other molecular signals within cells (Box 7A). 
fluorescent (Figure C). Molecular cloning 
Dramatic breakthroughs in our under- 
standing of the brain often rely on 
development of new experimental 
techniques. This certainly has been true 
for our understanding of intracellular 
signaling in neurons, which has ben- 
efited enormously from the invention 
of imaging techniques that allow direct 
visualization of signaling processes 
within living cells. The first advance— 
and arguably the most significant— 
came from the development, by Roger 
Tsien and his colleagues, of the fluo- 
rescent dye fura-2 (Figure A). Calcium 
ions bind to fura-2 and cause the dye's 
fluorescence properties to change. 
When fura-2 is introduced inside cells 
and the cells are then imaged with a 
fluorescence microscope, this dye serves 
as a reporter of intracellular Ca** con- 
centration. Fura-2 imaging has allowed 
us to detect the spatial and temporal 
dynamics of the Ca** signals that trigger 
innumerable process within neurons 
and glial cells; for example, fura-2 was 
used to obtain the image of Ca** sig- 
naling during neurotransmitter release 
shown in Figure 5.11A. 
Subsequent refinement of the 
chemical structure of fura-2 has yielded 
many other fluorescent Ca'* indicator 
dyes with different fluorescence proper- 
ties and different sensitivities to Ca'. 
One of these dyes is Calcium Green, 
which was used to image the dynamic 
changes in Ca** concentration pro- 
duced within the dendrites of cerebellar 
Purkinje cells by the intracellular mes- 
senger IP, (Figure B). Further develop- 
ments have led to indicators for visual- 
izing the spatial and temporal dynamics 
of other second messenger signals, such 
as CAMP. 
Another tremendous advance in the 
dynamic imaging of signaling processes 
came from the discovery of a green 
fluorescent protein first isolated from 
the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. Green 
fluorescent protein, or GFP, is (as its 
name indicates) a protein that is brightly 
of the GFP gene allows imaging tech- 
niques to visualize expression of gene 
products labeled with GFP fluorescence. 
The first such use of GFP was in experi- 
ments with the worm Caenorhabditis 
elegans, in which Martin Chalfie and his 
colleagues rendered neurons fluorescent 
by inducing GFP expression in these 
cells. Many subsequent experiments 
have used expression of GFP in the 
mammalian brain to image the structure 
of individual neurons (Figure D). 
Molecular genetic strategies make 
it possible to attach GFP to almost any 
protein, thereby allowing fluorescence 
microscopy to image the spatial distri- 
bution of labeled proteins. In this way, 
it has been possible to visualize dynam- 
ic changes in the location of neuronal 
proteins during signaling events. For 
example, Fig. 8.11 illustrates the use of 
GFP imaging to monitor the activation

of the Ca**/calmodulin-dependent pro-

synaptic potentiation. 
As was the case for fura-2, subse- 
quent refinement of GFP has led to 
numerous improvements. One such 
improvement is the production of pro- 
teins that fluoresce in colors other than 
green, thus permitting the simultane- 
ous imaging of multiple types of pro- 
teins and/or multiple types of neurons. 
Further refinements have led to tech- 
niques for monitoring the enzymatic 
activity of protein kinases and other 
signaling proteins. 
Just in the way that development of 
the Golgi staining technique opened 
our eyes to the cellular composition 
of the brain (see Chapter 1), study of 
intracellular signaling in the brain has 
been revolutionized by fura-2, GFP, 
and other dynamic imaging meth- 
ods. There is no end in sight for the

Second Messenger Targets: 
Protein Kinases and Phosphatases 
As already mentioned, second messengers typically regu- 
late neuronal functions by modulating the phosphorylation 
state of intracellular proteins (Figure 7.8). Phosphorylation 
(the addition of phosphate groups) rapidly and reversibly 
changes protein function. Proteins are phosphorylated by 
a wide variety of protein kinases; phosphate groups are 
removed by other enzymes called protein phosphatases. 
The degree of phosphorylation of a target protein reflects a 
balance between the competing actions of protein kinases 
and phosphatases, thus integrating a host of cellular signal- 
ing pathways. The substrates of protein kinases and phos- 
phatases include enzymes, neurotransmitter receptors, ion 
channels, and structural proteins. 
Protein kinases and phosphatases typically act either 
on the serine and threonine residues (Ser/Thr kinases or 
phosphatases) or on the tyrosine residues (Tyr kinases or 
phosphatases) of their substrates. Some of these enzymes 
act specifically on only one or a handful of protein targets, 
while others are multifunctional and have a broad range of 
substrate proteins. The activity of protein kinases and phos- 
phatases can be regulated either by second messengers, 
such as cAMP or Ca**, or by extracellular chemical signals 
such as growth factors (see Chapter 23). Typically, second 
messengers activate Ser/Thr kinases, whereas extracellular 
signals activate Tyr kinases. Although thousands of protein 
kinases are expressed in the brain, a relatively small number 
function as regulators of neuronal signaling. 
¢ cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The primary effec- 
tor of cAMP is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). 
PKA is a tetrameric complex of two catalytic subunits and 
two inhibitory (regulatory) subunits. cAMP activates PKA 
by binding to the regulatory subunits and causing them 
to release active catalytic subunits. Such displacement of

Regulation of cellular proteins by phosphorylation. Protein

dues on substrate proteins. This phosphorylation reversibly alters the structure and 
function of cellular proteins. Removal of the phosphate groups is catalyzed by protein 
phosphatases. Both kinases and phosphatases are regulated by a variety of intracel- 
lular second messengers.

inhibitory domains is a general mechanism for activation 
of several protein kinases by second messengers (Figure 
7.9A). The catalytic subunit of PKA phosphorylates serine 
and threonine residues of many different target proteins. 
Although this subunit is similar to the catalytic domains of 
other protein kinases, distinct amino acids allow the PKA 
to bind to specific target proteins, thus allowing only those 
targets to be phosphorylated in response to intracellular 
cAMP signals. 
¢ Ca**/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaM- 
KII), Ca** ions binding to calmodulin can regulate protein 
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. In neurons, the most 
abundant Ca**/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is 
CaMKII, a multifunctional Ser/Thr protein kinase. CaM- 
KI] is composed of approximately 14 subunits, which in 
the brain are the a and 8 types. Each subunit contains a 
catalytic domain and a regulatory domain, as well as other 
domains that allow the enzyme to oligomerize and target 
to the proper region within the cell. Ca**/calmodulin acti- 
vates CaMKII by displacing the inhibitory domain from the 
catalytic site (Figure 7.9B). CaMKII phosphorylates a large 
number of substrates, including ion channels and other 
proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction. 
° Protein kinase C (PKC). Another important group of Ser/ 
Thr protein kinases is protein kinase C (PKC). PKCs are 
diverse monomeric kinases activated by the second mes- 
sengers DAG and Ca**. DAG causes PKC to move from the 
cytosol to the plasma membrane, where it also binds Ca'* 
and phosphatidylserine, 
a membrane phospholipid (Figure 
7.9C). These events relieve autoinhibition and cause PKC to 
phosphorylate various protein substrates. PKC also diffuses 
to sites other than the plasma membrane—such as the cyto- 
skeleton, perinuclear sites, and the nucleus—where it phos- 
phorylates still other substrate proteins. Prolonged activation 
of PKC can be accomplished with phorbol esters, tumor-pro- 
moting compounds that activate PKC by mimicking DAG. 
¢ Protein tyrosine kinases. Two classes of 
protein kinases transfer phosphate groups 
to tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. 
Receptor tyrosine kinases are transmem- 
brane proteins with an extracellular domain 
that binds to protein ligands (growth factors, 
neurotrophic factors, or cytokines) and an 
intracellular catalytic domain that phosphor- 
ylates the relevant substrate proteins. Non- 
receptor tyrosine kinases are cytoplasmic 
or membrane-associated enzymes that are 
indirectly activated by extracellular signals. 
Tyrosine phosphorylation is less common 
than Ser/Thr phosphorylation, and it often 
serves to recruit signaling molecules to the 
phosphorylated protein. Tyrosine kinases 
are particularly important for cell growth 
and differentiation (see Chapters 22 and 23).

activation. Protein kinases contain several 
specialized domains with specific functions. 
Each of the kinases has homologous catalytic 
domains responsible for transferring phos- 
phate groups to substrate proteins. These. 
catalytic domains are kept inactive by the 
presence of an autoinhibitory domain that 
occupies the catalytic site. Binding of second 
messengers (such as cAMP, DAG, and Ca?*) 
to the appropriate regulatory domain of the 
kinase removes the autoinhibitory domain 
and allows the catalytic domain to be activat- 
ed. For some kinases, such as PKC and CaMKIl, 
; 
the autoinhibitory and catalytic domains are 
part of the same molecule. For other kinases, 
such as PKA, the autoinhibitory domain is a 
separate subunit. 
(B) CaMKII 
¢ Mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK). In addition to protein kinases 
that are directly activated by second mes- 
sengers, some of these molecules can be 
activated by other signals, such as phos- 
phorylation by another protein kinase. 
Important examples of such protein ki- 
nases are the mitogen-activated protein 
kinases (MAPKs), also called extracellular 
(c) pK 
signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). MAPKs 
were first identified as participants in the 
control of cell growth and are now known 
to have many other signaling functions. 
MAPKs are normally inactive in neu- 
rons but become activated when they 
are phosphorylated by other kinases. In 
fact, MAPKs are part of a kinase cascade 
in which one protein kinase phosphory- 
lates and activates the next protein kinase 
in the cascade. The extracellular signals 
that trigger these kinase cascades are of- 
ten extracellular growth factors that bind 
to receptor tyrosine kinases that, in turn, 
activate monomeric G-proteins such as ras. Once activated, 
MAPKs can phosphorylate transcription factors, proteins 
that regulate gene expression. Among the wide variety of 
other MAPK substrates are various enzymes, including 
other protein kinases, and cytoskeletal proteins. 
The best-characterized protein phosphatases are the Ser/ 
Thr phosphatases PP1, PP2A, and PP2B (also called calci- 
neurin). In general, protein phosphatases display less sub- 
strate specificity than protein kinases. Their limited specific- 
ity may arise from the fact that the catalytic subunits of the 
three major protein phosphatases are highly homologous,

though each still associates with specific targeting or regu- 
latory subunits. PP1 dephosphorylates a wide array of sub- 
strate proteins and is probably the most prevalent Ser/Thr 
protein phosphatase in mammalian cells. PP1 activity is 
regulated by several inhibitory proteins expressed in neu- 
rons. PP2A is a multisubunit enzyme with a broad range 
of substrates that overlap with PP1. PP2B, or calcineurin, 
is present at high levels in neurons. A distinctive feature 
of this phosphatase is its activation by Ca?*/calmodulin. 
PP2B is composed of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit. 
Ca**/calmodulin activates PP2B primarily by binding to the 

catalytic subunit and displacing the inhibitory regulatory 
domain. PP2B generally does not have the same molecular 
targets as CaMKII, even though both enzymes are activated 
by Ca**/calmodulin. 
In summary, activation of membrane receptors can elicit 
complex cascades of enzyme activation, resulting in second 
messenger production and protein phosphorylation or de- 
phosphorylation. These cytoplasmic signals produce a vari- 
ety of rapid physiological responses by transiently regulat- 
ing enzyme activity, ion channels, cytoskeletal proteins, and 
many other cellular processes. At excitatory synapses, these 
signaling components are often contained within dendritic 
spines, which appear to serve as specialized signaling 
compartments within neurons (Box 7B). In addition, such 
signals can propagate to the nucleus to cause long-lasting 
changes in gene expression. 
Nuclear Signaling 
Second messengers elicit prolonged changes in neuronal 
function by promoting the synthesis of new RNA and pro- 
tein. The resulting accumulation of new proteins requires 
at least 30-60 minutes, a time frame that is orders of mag- 
nitude slower than the responses mediated by ion fluxes 
or phosphorylation. Likewise, the reversal of such events 
requires hours to days. In some cases, genetic "switches"

can be "thrown" to permanently alter a neuron, as occurs 
in neuronal differentiation (see Chapter 22). 
The amount of protein present in cells is determined pri- 
marily by the rate of transcription of DNA into RNA (Figure 
7.10). The first step in RNA synthesis is the decondensa- 
tion of the structure of chromatin to provide binding sites 
for the RNA polymerase complex and for transcriptional 
activator proteins, also called transcription factors. Tran- 
scriptional activator proteins attach to binding sites that are 
present on the DNA molecule near the start of the target 
gene sequence; they also bind to other proteins that pro- 
mote unwrapping of DNA. The net result of these actions 
is to allow RNA polymerase, an enzyme complex, to as- 
semble on the promoter region of the DNA and begin 
transcription. In addition to clearing the promoter for RNA 
polymerase, activator proteins can stimulate transcription 
by interacting with the RNA polymerase complex or by in- 
teracting with other activator proteins that influence the 
polymerase. 
Intracellular signal transduction cascades regulate gene 
expression by converting transcriptional activator proteins 
from an inactive state to an active state in which they are 
able to bind to DNA. This conversion comes about in sev- 
eral ways. The following sections briefly summarize the key 
activator proteins and the mechanisms that allow them to 
regulate gene expression in response to signaling events. 
FIGURE 7.10. Steps in the transcription 
of DNA into RNA. Condensed chromatin (A) 
is decondensed into a beads-on-a-DNA-string 
array (B) in which an upstream activator site 
(UAS) is free of proteins and is bound bya 
sequence-specific transcriptional activator pro- 
tein (a transcription factor). The transcriptional 
activator protein then binds co-activator com- 
plexes that enable the RNA polymerase with 
its associated factors to bind at the start site of 
transcription and initiate RNA synthesis.

CHAPTER 7 
BOX 7B Dendritic Spines 
_ Many synapses in the brain involve 
_ microscopic dendritic protrusions 
_ 
_ known as spines (Figure A). Spines 
| are distinguished by the presence of 
_ globular tips called spine heads, which 
_ serve as the postsynaptic site of inner- 
_ vation by presynaptic terminals. Spine 
heads are connected to the main shafts 
_ of dendrites by narrow links called 
_ spine necks (Figure B). Just beneath the 
_ 
site of contact between the terminals 
and the spine heads are intracellular 
' structures called postsynaptic densities 
(Figure C). The number, size, and shape 
_ of dendritic spines are quite variable 
and can, at least in some cases, change 
dynamically over time (see Figure 8.15). 
Spine properties are reportedly altered 
in a number of neurodegenerative dis- 
_ orders (such as Alzheimer's disease) 
and psychiatric disorders (such as 
_ autism and schizophrenia). 
_ 
Since the earliest description of these 
structures by Santiago Ramon y Cajal 
in the late 1800s, dendritic spines have 
fascinated generations of neuroscientists, 
inspiring many speculations about their 
function. One of the earliest conjectures 
was that the narrow spine neck electri- 
_ 
cally isolates synapses from the rest of 
the neuron. Given that the size of spine 
necks can change, such a mechanism 
could cause the physiological effect of 
individual synapses to vary over time, 
thereby providing a cellular mechanism 
for forms of synaptic plasticity such as 
long-term potentiation (LTP) and long- 
term depression (LTD). However, sub- 
sequent measurements of the properties 
of spine necks indicate that these struc- 
tures would be relatively ineffective in 
attenuating the flow of electrical current 
between spine heads and dendrites. 
Another theory—currently the most 
popular functional concept—postulates 
that spines create biochemical compart- 
ments. This idea is based on the idea that 
the spine neck could impede diffusion of 
biochemical signals from the spine head 
to the rest of the dendrite. Several obser- 
vations are consistent with this notion. 
First, measurements show that the spine 
neck does indeed serve as a barrier to 
diffusion, slowing the rate of molecular

Second, spines are found only at excit- 
atory synapses, where it is known that 
synaptic transmission generates many 
diffusible signals, most notably the sec- 
ond messenger Ca**. Finally, fluorescence 
imaging shows that synaptic Ca"* signals 
can indeed be restricted to dendritic 
spines in some circumstances (Figure D). 
Nevertheless, there are counterar- 
guments to the hypothesis that spines

of spine 
provide relatively isolated biochemical 
compartments. For example, it is known 
that other second messengers, such as 
IP,, as well as the monomeric G-protein 
ras, can diffuse out of the spine head 
and into the dendritic shaft. This differ- 
ence in diffusion presumably is due to 
the fact that such signals last longer than 
Ca" signals, allowing them sufficient 
time to overcome the diffusion barrier of 
the spine neck. Another relevant point is 
that postsynaptic Ca** signals are highly 
localized, even at excitatory synapses 
that do not have spines. Thus, in at least 
some instances, spines are neither nec- 
essary nor sufficient for localization of 
synaptic second messenger signaling. 
A final and less controversial idea is 
_ 
that the purpose of spines is to serve as 
reservoirs where signaling proteins— 
such as the downstream molecular 
targets of Ca**, IP, and ras—can be 
concentrated. Consistent with this

possibility, glutamate receptors are high- 
ly concentrated on spine heads, and the 
postsynaptic density comprises dozens 
of proteins involved in intracellular sig- 
nal transduction (Figure E). According to 
this view, the spine head is the destina- 
tion for these signaling molecules during 
the assembly of synapses, as well as the 
target of the second messengers that are 
produced by the local activation of glu- 
tamate receptors. Recent work indicates 
that spines also can trap molecules that 
are diffusing along the dendrite, which 
could be a means of concentrating these 
molecules within spines. 
Although the function of den- 
dritic spines remains enigmatic, Cajal 
undoubtedly would be pleased at the 
enormous amount of attention that 
these tiny synaptic structures continue 
to command, and the real progress that 
has been made in understanding the 
variety of tasks they are capable of.

CHAPTER 7 
¢ CREB. The cAMP response element binding protein, 
usually abbreviated CREB, is a ubiquitous transcriptional 
activator (Figure 7.11). CREB is normally bound to its bind- 
ing site on DNA (called the cAMP response element, or 
CRE), either as a homodimer or bound to another, closely 
related transcription factor. In unstimulated cells, CREB is 
not phosphorylated and has little or no transcriptional ac- 
tivity. However, phosphorylation of CREB greatly potenti- 
ates transcription. Several signaling pathways are capable 
of causing CREB to be phosphorylated. Both PKA and the 
ras pathway, for example, can phosphorylate CREB. CREB 
can also be phosphorylated in response to increased intra- 
cellular calcium, in which case the CRE site is also called 
the CaRE (calcium response element) site. The calcium- 
dependent phosphorylation of CREB is primarily caused

and MAP kinase. Phosphorylation of CREB allows it to bind co- 
activators (not shown in the figure), which then stimulate RNA 
polymerase to begin synthesis of RNA. RNA is then processed 
and exported to the cytoplasm, where it serves as mRNA for 
translation into protein.

CREB-mediated transcription by inhibiting a protein phos- 
phatase that dephosphorylates CREB. CREB is thus an ex- 
ample of the convergence of multiple signaling pathways 
onto a single transcriptional activator. 
Many genes whose transcription is regulated by CREB 
have been identified. CREB-sensitive genes include the 
immediate early gene, c-fos (see below), the neurotrophin 
BDNF (see Chapter 23), the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase 
(which is important for synthesis of catecholamine neu- 
rotransmitters; see Chapter 6), and many neuropeptides 
(including somatostatin, enkephalin, and corticotropin-re- 
leasing hormone). CREB also is thought to mediate long- 
lasting changes in brain function. For example, CREB has 
been implicated in spatial learning, behavioral sensitization, 
long-term memory of odorant-conditioned behavior, and 
long-term synaptic plasticity (see Chapters 24 and 25). 
¢ Nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors for membrane- 
permeant ligands also are transcriptional activators. The 
receptor for glucocorticoid hormones illustrates one mode 
of action of such receptors. In the absence of glucocorti- 
coid hormones, the receptors are located in the cytoplasm. 
Binding of glucocorticoids causes the receptor to unfold and 
move to the nucleus, where it binds a specific recognition 
site on the DNA. This DNA binding activates the relevant 
RNA polymerase complex to initiate transcription and sub- 
sequent gene expression. Thus, a critical regulatory event 
for steroid receptors is their translocation to the nucleus to 
allow DNA binding. 
The receptor for thyroid hormone (TH) illustrates a sec- 
ond mode of regulation. In the absence of TH, the recep- 
tor is bound to DNA and serves as a potent repressor of 
transcription. Upon binding TH, the receptor undergoes a 
conformational change that ultimately opens the promoter 
for polymerase binding. Hence, TH binding switches the 
receptor from being a repressor to being an activator of 
transcription. A number of hormones regulate gene expres- 
sion via such nuclear receptors. 
¢ c-fos. A different strategy of gene regulation is apparent 
in the function of the transcriptional activator protein c-fos. 
In resting cells, c-fos is present at a very low concentration. 
Stimulation of the target cell causes c-fos to be synthesized, 
and the amount of this protein rises dramatically over 30-60 
minutes. Therefore, c-fos is considered to be an immediate 
early gene because its synthesis is directly triggered by the 
stimulus. Once synthesized, c-fos protein can act as a tran- 
scriptional activator to induce synthesis of second-order 
genes. These are termed delayed response genes because 
their activity is delayed by the fact that an immediate early 
gene—c-fos, in this case—must be activated first. 
Multiple signals converge on c-fos, activating different 
transcription factors that bind to at least three distinct sites 
in the promoter region of the gene. The regulatory region 
of the c-fos gene contains a binding site that mediates 
MOLECULAR SIGNALING WITHIN NEURONS 
157 
transcriptional induction by cytokines and ciliary neuro- 
tropic factor. Another site is targeted by growth factors such 
as neurotrophins through ras and protein kinase C, and a 
CRE/CaRE that can bind to CREB and thereby respond to 
cAMP or calcium entry resulting from electrical activity. In 
addition to synergistic interactions among these c-fos sites, 
transcriptional signals can be integrated by converging on 
the same activator, such as CREB. 
Nuclear signaling events typically result in the genera- 
tion of a large and relatively stable complex composed of 
a functional transcriptional activator protein, additional 
proteins that bind to the activator protein, and the RNA 
polymerase and associated proteins bound at the start site 
of transcription. Most of the relevant signaling events act to 
"seed" this complex by generating an active transcriptional 
activator protein by phosphorylation, by inducing a confor- 
mational change in the activator upon ligand binding, by 
fostering nuclear localization, by removing an inhibitor, or 
simply by making more activator protein. 
Examples of Neuronal Signal 
Transduction 
Understanding the general properties of signal transduc- 
tion processes at the plasma membrane, in the cytosol, and 
within the nucleus make it possible to consider how these 
processes work in concert to mediate specific functions in 
the brain. Three important signal transduction pathways il- 
lustrate some of the roles of intracellular signal transduction 
processes in the nervous system. 
¢ NGE/TrkA. The first of these is signaling by the nerve 
growth factor (NGF). This protein is a member of the 
neurotrophin growth factor family and is required for the 
differentiation, survival, and synaptic connectivity of sym- 
pathetic and sensory neurons (see Chapter 23). 
NGF works 
by binding to a high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkA, 
found on the plasma membrane of these target cells (Figure 
7.12). NGF binding causes TrkA receptors to dimerize, and 
the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of each receptor then 
phosphorylates its partner receptor. Phosphorylated TrkA 
receptors trigger the ras cascade, resulting in the activation 
of multiple protein kinases. Some of these kinases trans- 
locate to the nucleus to activate transcriptional activators, 
such as CREB. This ras-based component of the NGF path- 
way is primarily responsible for inducing and maintaining 
differentiation of NGF-sensitive neurons. Phosphorylation 
of TrkA also causes this receptor to stimulate the activity 
of phospholipase C, which increases production of IP, and 
DAG. IP, induces release of Ca** from the endoplasmic re- 
ticulum, and diacylglycerol activates PKC. These two sec- 
ond messengers appear to target many of the same down- 
stream effectors as ras. Finally, activation of TrkA receptors 
also causes activation of other protein kinases (such as Akt

marily mediates the NGF-dependent survival of sympa- 
thetic and sensory neurons described in Chapter 23. 
¢ Long-term depression (LTD). The interplay between sev- 
eral intracellular signals can be observed at the excitatory 
synapses that innervate Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. 
These synapses are central to information flow through 
the cerebellar cortex, which in turn helps coordinate motor 
movements (see Chapter 19). One of the synapses is be- 
tween the parallel fibers (PFs) and their Purkinje cell targets. 
LTD is a form of synaptic plasticity that causes the PF syn- 
apses to become less effective (see Chapter 25). When PFs 
are active, they release the neurotransmitter glutamate onto 
the dendrites of Purkinje cells. This activates AMPA-type 
receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels (see Chap- 
ter 6), and causes a small EPSP that briefly depolarizes the 
Purkinje cell. In addition to this electrical signal, PF synaptic 
transmission also generates two second messengers within 
the Purkinje cell (Figure 7.13). The glutamate released by 
PFs activates metabotropic glutamate receptors, which stim- 
ulates phospholipase C to produce IP, and DAG. When the 
PF synapses alone are active, these intracellular signals are 
insufficient to open IP, receptors or to stimulate PKC. 
LTD is induced when PF synapses are activated at the 
same time as the glutamatergic climbing fiber synapses 
FIGURE 7.12 
Mechanism of action of NGF. NGF binds 
to a high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkA, on the 
plasma membrane to induce phosphorylation of TrkA at 
two different tyrosine residues. These phosphorylated tyro- 
sines serve to tether various adapter proteins or phospho- 
lipase C (PLC), which, in turn, activate three major signaling 
pathways: the PI 3 kinase pathway leading to activation of 
Akt kinase, the ras pathway leading to MAP kinases, and 
the PLC pathway leading to release of intracellular Ca** 
and activation of PKC. The ras and PLC pathways primarily 
stimulate processes responsible for neuronal differentia- 
tion, whereas the PI 3 kinase pathway is primarily involved 
in cell survival. 
that also innervate Purkinje cells. The climbing fiber 
synapses produce large EPSPs that strongly depolar- 
ize the membrane potential of the Purkinje cell. This 
depolarization allows Ca?* to enter the Purkinje cell 
via voltage-gated Ca?* channels. When both synapses 
are simultaneously activated, the rise in intracellular 
Ca?* concentration caused by the climbing fiber syn- 
apse enhances the sensitivity of IP, receptors to the 
IP, produced by PF synapses and allows the IP, re- 
ceptors within the Purkinje cell to open. This releases 
Ca?* from the endoplasmic reticulum and further el- 
evates Ca** concentration locally near the PF synapses. 
This larger rise in Ca**, in conjunction with the DAG 
produced by the PF synapses, activates PKC. PKC in 
turn phosphorylates a number of substrate proteins. 
Ultimately, these signaling processes change AMPA-type 
receptors at the PF synapse, so that these receptors pro- 
duce smaller electrical signals in response to the glutamate 
released from the PFs. This weakening of the PF synapse is 
the final cause of LTD. 
In short, transmission at Purkinje cell synapses produces 
brief electrical signals and chemical signals that last much 
longer. The temporal interplay between these signals al- 
lows LTD to occur only when both PF and climbing fiber 
synapses are active. The actions of IP,, DAG, and Ca** also 
are restricted to small parts of the Purkinje cell dendrite, 
which is a more limited spatial range than the EPSPs, which 
spread throughout the entire dendrite and cell body of the 
Purkinje cell. Thus, in contrast to the electrical signals, the 
second messenger signals can impart precise information 
about the location of active synapses and allow LTD to oc- 
cur only in the vicinity of active PFs. 
¢ Phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase. A third exam- 
ple of intracellular signaling in the nervous system is the 
regulation of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. Tyrosine 
hydroxylase governs the synthesis of the catecholamine 
neurotransmitters: dopamine, norepinephrine, and epi- 
nephrine (see Chapter 6). A number of signals, includ- 
ing electrical activity, other neurotransmitters, and NGE, 
increase the rate of catecholamine synthesis by increasing

The rapid increase of tyrosine hydroxylase activity is largely 
due to phosphorylation of this enzyme. 
Tyrosine hydroxylase is a substrate for several protein 
kinases, including PKA, CaMKII, MAP kinase, and PKC. 
Phosphorylation causes conformational changes that in- 
crease the catalytic activity of tyrosine hydroxylase. Stimuli 
that elevate cAMP, Ca**, or DAG can all increase tyrosine 
hydroxylase activity and thus increase the rate of catechol- 
amine biosynthesis. This regulation by several different 
signals allows for close control of tyrosine hydroxylase 
activity and illustrates how several different pathways can 
converge to influence a key enzyme involved in synaptic 
transmission. 
Summary 
Diverse signal transduction pathways exist within all neu- 
rons. Activation of these pathways typically is initiated by 
chemical signals such as neurotransmitters and hormones,

fibers activates both AMPA-type and metabo- 
tropic receptors. The latter produces IP, and DAG 
within the Purkinje cell. When paired with a rise 
in Ca** associated with activity of climbing fiber 
synapses, the IP, causes Ca** to be released from

together change the properties of AMPA recep-

which bind to receptors that include ligand-gated ion chan- 
nels, G-protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase re- 
ceptors. Many of these receptors activate either heterotri- 
meric or monomeric G-proteins that regulate intracellular 
enzyme cascades and/or ion channels. 
A common out- 
come of the activation of these receptors is the production 
of second messengers, such as cAMP, Ca**, and IP,, that 
bind to effector enzymes. Particularly important effectors 
are protein kinases and phosphatases that regulate the 
phosphorylation state of their substrates, and thus their 
function. These substrates can be metabolic enzymes or 
other signal transduction molecules, such as ion channels, 
protein kinases, or transcription factors that regulate gene 
expression. Examples of such transcription factors include 
CREB, steroid hormone receptors, and c-fos. This plethora 
of molecular components allows intracellular signal trans- 
duction pathways to generate responses over a wide range 
of times and distances, greatly augmenting and refining the 
information-processing ability of neuronal circuits and, ul- 
timately, brain systems.

Tyrosine hydroxylase governs the synthesis of

the catecholamine neurotransmitters and is 
stimulated by a number of intracellular signals. 
In the example shown here, neuronal electri- 
cal activity (1) causes influx of Ca?* (2). The 
resultant rise in intracellular Ca?* concentration 
(3) activates protein kinases (4), which phos- 
phorylates tyrosine hydroxylase (5), stimulating 
catecholamine synthesis (6). This increased 
synthesis in turn increases the release of cat- 
echolamines (7) and enhances the postsynaptic 
response produced by the synapse (8).

Overview 
SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NEURONS provide the basic "wiring" of 
the brain's circuitry. However, in contrast to the wiring of an electronic device such 
a computer, synaptic connectivity between neurons is a dynamic entity that is con- 
stanty changing in response to neural activity and other influences. Such changes 
in synaptic transmission arise from a number of forms of plasticity that vary in time 
scale from milliseconds to years. Most short-term forms of synaptic plasticity affect 
the amount of neurotransmitter released from presynaptic terminals in response 
to a presynaptic action potential. Several forms of short-term synaptic plasticity— 
including facilitation, augmentation, and potentiation—enhance neurotransmitter 
release and are caused by persistent actions of calcium ions within the presynaptic 
terminal. Another form of short-term plasticity, synaptic depression, decreases the 
amount of neurotransmitter released and appears to be due to an activity-dependent 
depletion of synaptic vesicles that are ready to undergo exocytosis. Long-term forms 
of synaptic plasticity alter synaptic transmission over time scales of 30 minutes or 
longer. Examples of such long-lasting plasticity include long-term potentiation and 
long-term depression. These long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity arise from mo- 
lecular mechanisms that vary over time: the initial changes in synaptic transmission 
arise from posttranslational modifications of existing proteins, most notably changes 
in the trafficking of glutamate receptors, while later phases of synaptic modification 
result from changes in gene expression. These changes in gene expression produce 
enduring changes in synaptic transmission, including growth of synapses, that can 
yield essentially permanent modifications of brain function. 
Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity 
Chemical synapses are capable of undergoing plastic changes that either strengthen 
or weaken synaptic transmission. Synaptic plasticity mechanisms occur on time 
scales ranging from milliseconds to days, weeks, or longer. The short-term forms 
of plasticity—those lasting for a few minutes or less—are readily observed during 
repeated activation of any chemical synapse. There are several forms of short-term 
synaptic plasticity that differ in their time courses and their underlying mechanisms.

(A) Facilitation at the squid giant synapse. A pair of presynaptic 
action potentials elicits two excitatory postsynaptic potentials 
(EPSPs). Because of facilitation, the second EPSP is larger than the 
first. (B) By varying the time interval between pairs of presynaptic 
action potentials, facilitation can be seen to decay over a time 
course of tens of milliseconds. (C) Under normal physiological con- 
ditions, a high-frequency tetanus (darker bar) causes pronounced 
depression of EPSPs at the squid giant synapse (top). Lowering the 
external Ca** concentration to an intermediate level reduces trans- 
mitter release and causes a mixture of depression and augmenta- 
tion (middle). Further reduction of the external Ca** eliminates 
depression, leaving only augmentation (bottom). (D) Synaptic 
depression at the frog neuromuscular synapse increases in propor- 
tion to the amount of transmitter released from the presynaptic ter- 
minal. (E) Application of a 
high-frequency tetanus (bar) to presyn- 
aptic axons innervating a spinal motor neuron causes a post-tetanic 
potentiation that persists for a couple of minutes after the tetanus 
ends. (A,B after Charlton and Bittner, 1978; C after Swandulla et al., 
1991; D from Betz, 1970; E after Lev-Tov et al., 1983.) 
Synaptic facilitation is a rapid increase in synaptic 
strength that occurs when two or more action potentials 
invade the presynaptic terminal within a few milliseconds 
of each other (Figure 8.1A). By varying the time interval be- 
tween presynaptic action potentials, it can be seen that fa- 
cilitation produced by the first action potential lasts for tens

of milliseconds (Figure 8.1B). Many lines of evidence indicate 
that facilitation is the result of prolonged elevation of pre- 
synaptic calcium levels following synaptic activity. Although 
the entry of Ca** into the presynaptic terminal occurs within 
a millisecond or two after an action potential invades (see 
Figure 5.10B), the mechanisms that return Ca2* to resting 

levels are much slower. Thus, when action potentials arrive 
close together in time, calcium builds up within the terminal 
and allows more neurotransmitter to be released by a subse- 
quent presynaptic action potential. The target of this residual 
Ca* signal is not yet clear; one possibility is partial occupancy 
of the Ca** binding sites of synaptotagmin, the Ca?* sensor 
protein that triggers neurotransmitter release, 
_ 
Opposing facilitation is synaptic depression, which 
causes neurotransmitter release to decline during sustained 
synaptic activity (Figure 8.1C, top). An important clue to the 
cause of synaptic depression comes from observations that 
depression depends on the amount of neurotransmitter that 
has been released. For example, lowering the external Ca?* 
concentration, to reduce the number of quanta released by 
each presynaptic action potential, causes the rate of depres- 
sion to be slowed (Figure 8.1C). Likewise, the total amount 
of depression is proportional to the amount of transmitter 
released from the presynaptic terminal (Figure 8.1D). These 
results have led to the idea that depression is caused by pro- 
gressive depletion of a pool of synaptic vesicles that are avail- 
able for release: when rates of release are high, these vesicles

deplete rapidly and cause a lot of depression; depletion slows 
as the rate of release is reduced, yielding less depression. 
According to this vesicle depletion hypothesis, depression 
causes the strength of transmission to decline until this pool 
is replenished by mobilization of vesicles from a reserve pool. 
Consistent with this explanation are observations that more 
depression is observed after the size of the reserve pool is 
reduced by impairing synapsin, a protein that maintains 
vesicles in the reserve pool (see Chapter 5). 
Still other forms of synaptic plasticity, such as synaptic 
potentiation and augmentation, also are elicited by re- 
peated synaptic activity and serve to increase the amount 
of transmitter released from presynaptic terminals. Both 
augmentation and potentiation enhance the ability of in- 
coming calcium ions to trigger fusion of synaptic vesicles 
with the plasma membrane, but work over different time 
scales. While augmentation rises and falls over a few sec- 
onds (Figure 8.1C, lower panel), potentiation acts over a 
time scale of tens of seconds to minutes (Figure 8.1E). As 
a result of its slow time course, potentiation can greatly 
outlast the tetanic stimulus that induces it and is often 
called post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). Although 
both augmentation and potentiation are thought to 
arise from prolonged elevation of presynaptic cal- 
cium levels during synaptic activity, the mechanisms 
responsible for these forms of plasticity are poorly 
understood. It has been proposed that augmenta- 
tion results from Ca** enhancing the actions of the 
presynaptic protein munc-13, while potentiation 
may arise when Ca** activates presynaptic protein 
kinases that go on to phosphorylate substrates (such 
as synapsin) that regulate transmitter release. 
During repetitive synaptic activity, these forms 
of short-term plasticity can interact to cause syn- 
aptic transmission to change in complex ways. For 
example, at the peripheral neuromuscular synapse, 
repeated activity first causes an accumulation of Ca** 
that allows facilitation and then augmentation to en- 
(30 seconds 
later) 
hance synaptic transmission (Figure 8.2). The ensuing 
depletion of synaptic vesicles then causes depression 
to dominate and weaken the synapse. Presynaptic

and persists for many seconds after the end of the stimu- 
lus, leading to post-tetanic potentiation. (A after Katz, 
1966; B from Malenka and Siegelbaum, 2001.)

essential cellular and molecular underpinnings are likely 
to be conserved in the nervous systems of very different 
organisms. This approach has been successful in identifying 
several forms of long-term synaptic plasticity and in dem- 
onstrating that such forms of synaptic plasticity underlie 
simple forms of learning. 
Eric Kandel and his colleagues at Columbia University 
have addressed such questions by using the marine mollusk 
Aplysia californica (Figure 8.3A). This sea slug has only a 
few tens of thousands of neurons, many of which are quite 
large (up to 1 mm in diameter) and in stereotyped loca- 
tions within the ganglia that make up the animal's nervous 
system (Figure 8.3B). These attributes make it practical to 
monitor the electrical activity of specific, identifiable nerve 
cells, and thus to define the synaptic circuits involved in 
mediating the limited behavioral repertoire of Aplysia. 
Aplysia exhibit several elementary forms of behavioral 
plasticity. One form is habituation, a process that causes 
the animal to become less responsive to repeated occur- 
rences of a stimulus. Habituation is found in many other 
species, including humans. For example, when dressing 
we initially experience tactile sensations due to clothes 
stimulating our skin, but habituation quickly causes these 
sensations to fade. Similarly, a light touch to the siphon 
of an Aplysia results in withdrawal of the animal's gill, but 
habituation causes the gill withdrawal to become weaker 
during repeated stimulation of the siphon (Figure 8.3C). 
The gill-withdrawal response of Aplysia exhibits another 
form of plasticity called sensitization. Sensitization is a 
process that allows an animal to generalize an aversive re- 
sponse elicited by a noxious stimulus to a variety of other, 
non-noxious stimuli. In Aplysia that have habituated to si- 
phon touching, sensitization of gill withdrawal is elicited 
by pairing a strong electrical stimulus to the animal's tail 
with another light touch of the siphon. This pairing causes 
the siphon stimulus to again elicit a strong withdrawal of 
the gill (Figure 8.3C, right) because the noxious stimulus to 
the tail sensitizes the gill-withdrawal reflex to light touch. 
Even after a single stimulus to the tail, the gill-withdrawal 
reflex remains enhanced for at least an hour (Figure 8.3D). 
This can be viewed as a simple form of short-term memory. 
With repeated pairing of tail and siphon stimuli, this be- 
havior can be altered for days or weeks (Figure 8.3E), also 
demonstrating a simple form of long-term memory. 
The small number of neurons in the Aplysia nervous sys- 
tem makes it possible to define the synaptic circuits involved 
in gill withdrawal and to monitor the activity of individual 
neurons in these circuits. Although hundreds of neurons are 
ultimately involved in producing this simple behavior, the 
activities of only a few different types of neurons can account 
for gill withdrawal and its plasticity during habituation and 
sensitization. These critical neurons include mechanosen- 
sory neurons that innervate the siphon, motor neurons that 
innervate muscles in the gill, and interneurons that receive 
SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY 
167 
inputs from a variety of sensory neurons (Figure 8.4A). 
Touching the siphon activates the mechanosensory neurons, 
which form excitatory synapses that release glutamate onto 
both the interneurons and the motor neurons; thus, touch- 
ing the siphon increases the probability that both of these 
postsynaptic targets will produce action potentials. The inter- 
neurons form excitatory synapses on motor neurons, further 
increasing the likelihood of the motor neurons firing action 
potentials in response to mechanical stimulation of the si- 
phon. When the motor neurons are activated by the summed 
synaptic excitation of the sensory neurons and interneurons, 
they release acetylcholine that excites the muscle cells of the 
gill, producing gill withdrawal. 
Both habituation and sensitization appear to arise from 
plastic changes in synaptic transmission in this circuit. Dur- 
ing habituation, transmission at the glutamatergic synapse 
between the sensory and motor neurons is depressed (Figure 
8.4B, left). This synaptic depression is thought to be respon- 
sible for the decreasing ability of siphon stimuli to evoke gill 
contractions during habituation. Much like the short-term 
form of synaptic depression described in the preceding sec- 
tion, this depression is presynaptic and is due to a reduction 
in the number of synaptic vesicles available for release. In 
contrast, sensitization modifies the function of this circuit 
by recruiting additional neurons. The tail shock that evokes 
sensitization activates sensory neurons that innervate the tail. 
These sensory neurons in turn excite modulatory interneu- 
rons that release serotonin onto the presynaptic terminals of 
the sensory neurons of the siphon (see Figure 8.4A). Sero- 
tonin enhances transmitter release from the siphon sensory 
neuron terminals, leading to increased synaptic excitation 
of the motor neurons (Figure 8.4B). This modulation of the 
sensory neuron-motor neuron synapse lasts approximately 
an hour (Figure 8.4C), which is similar to the duration of the 
short-term sensitization of gill withdrawal produced by ap- 
plying a single stimulus to the tail (Figure 8.3D). Thus, the 
short-term sensitization apparently is due to recruitment of 
additional synaptic elements that modulate synaptic trans- 
mission in the gill-withdrawal circuit. 
The mechanism thought to be responsible for the en- 
hancement of glutamatergic transmission during short-term 
sensitization is shown in Figure 8.5A. Serotonin released by 
the facilitatory interneurons binds to G-protein-coupled re- 
ceptors on the presynaptic terminals of the siphon sensory 
neurons (step 1), which stimulates production of the second 
messenger, cAMP (step 2). Cyclic AMP binds to the regula- 
tory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA; step 3), liberating 
catalytic subunits of PKA that are then able to phosphorylate 
several proteins, probably including K* channels (step 4). The 
net effect of the action of PKA is to reduce the probability 
that the K* channels open during a presynaptic action po- 
tential. This effect prolongs the presynaptic action potential, 
thereby opening more presynaptic Ca** channels (step 5). 
There is evidence that opening of presynaptic Ca** channels

is also directly enhanced by serotonin. Finally, the enhanced 
influx of Ca** into the presynaptic terminals increases the 
amount of transmitter released onto motor neurons during 
a sensory neuron action potential (step 6). In summary, a 
signal transduction cascade that involves neurotransmitters, 
second messengers, protein kinases, and ion channels medi- 
ates short-term sensitization of gill withdrawal. This cascade 
ultimately enhances synaptic transmission between the sen- 
sory and motor neurons within the gill-withdrawal circuit. 
The same serotonin-induced enhancement of gluta- 
mate release that mediates short-term sensitization is also 
thought to underlie long-term sensitization. However, dur- 
ing long-term sensitization this circuitry is affected for up 
to several weeks. The prolonged duration of this form of 
gene products that follow CRE activation have been dif- 
ficult to sort out, several consequences of gene activation 
have been identified. First, CREB stimulates the synthesis 
of an enzyme, ubiquitin hydroxylase, that stimulates deg- 
radation of the regulatory subunit of PKA. This causes a 
persistent increase in the amount of free catalytic subunit, 
meaning that some PKA is persistently active and no lon- 
ger requires serotonin to be activated. CREB also stimu- 
lates another transcriptional activator protein called C/EBP. 
C/EBP stimulates transcription of other, unknown genes 
that cause addition of synaptic terminals, yielding a long- 
term increase in the number of synapses between the 
sensory and the motor neurons. Such structural increases 
are not seen following short-term sensitization. They may 
represent the ultimate cause of the long-lasting change 
in overall strength of the relevant circuit connections that

synaptic structure. 
These studies of Aplysia and related 
work on other invertebrates, such as 
the fruit fly (Box 8A), have led to several 
generalizations about synaptic plasticity. 
First, synaptic plasticity clearly can lead 
to changes in circuit function and, ulti- 
mately, to behavioral plasticity. This con- 
clusion has triggered intense interest in 
synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Second, 
these plastic changes in synaptic func- 
tion can be either short-term effects that 
rely on posttranslational modification of 
existing synaptic proteins, or they can be 
long-term changes that require changes in 
gene expression, new protein synthesis, 
and growth of new synapses (or the elimi- 
nation of existing ones). Thus, it appears 
that short- and long-term changes in syn- 
aptic function have different mechanistic 
underpinnings. As the following sections 
will show, these generalizations apply 
to synaptic plasticity in the mammalian 
brain and, in fact, have helped guide our 
understanding of these forms of synaptic 
plasticity.

Long-term synaptic plasticity has also been identified 
within the mammalian brain. Here, some patterns of syn-

other patterns of activity produce a long-lasting decrease in

| As part of a renaissance in the genetic 
_ analysis of simple organisms in the mid- 
_ 1970s, several investigators recognized 
| that the genetic basis of learning and 
_ memory might be effectively studied 
- in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. 
_ In the intervening quarter-century, this 
_ approach has yielded some fundamen- 
_ tal insights. Although the mechanisms 
_ of learning and memory has certainly 
_ been one of the more difficult problems 
_ tackled by Drosophila geneticists, their 
- 
efforts have been surprisingly successful. 
_ A number of genetic mutations that alter 
_ learning and memory have been dis- 
- covered, and the identification of these 
genes has provided a valuable frame- 
_ work for studying the cellular mecha- 
_ nisms of these processes. 
The initial problem in this work 
_ was to develop behavioral tests that 
_ could identify abnormal learning and/ 
- 
or memory defects in large popula- 
tions of flies. This challenge was met 
by Seymour Benzer and his colleagues 
_ Chip Quinn and Bill Harris at the 
California Institute of Technology, who 
_ developed the olfactory and visual 
learning tests that have become the 
basis for most subsequent analyses 
of learning and memory in the fruit 
_ fly (see figure). Behavioral paradigms 
pairing odors or light with an aversive 
stimulus allowed Benzer and his col- 
leagues to assess associative learning in 
flies. The design of an ingenious testing 
apparatus controlled for non-learning- 
related sensory cues that had previously 
- complicated such behavioral testing. 
Moreover, the apparatus allowed large 
numbers of flies to be screened rela- 
tively easily, expediting the analysis of 
mutagenized populations. 
BOX 8A Genetics of Learning and Memory in the Fruit Fly 
These studies led to the identification 
of an ever-increasing number of single 
gene mutations that disrupt learning 
and/or memory in flies. The behavioral 
and molecular studies of the mutants 
(given whimsical but descriptive names 
like dunce, rutabaga, and amnesiac) 
suggested that a central pathway for 
learning and memory in the fly is sig- 
nal transduction mediated by the cyclic 
nucleotide cAMP. Thus, the gene prod- 
ucts of the dunce, rutabaga, and amnesiac 
loci are, respectively, a phosphodiester- 
ase (which degrades cAMP), an adenylyl 
cyclase (which converts ATP to cAMP), 
and a peptide transmitter that stimu- 
lates adenylyl cyclase. This conclusion 
about the importance of cAMP has been 
confirmed by the finding that genetic 
manipulation of the CREB transcription 
factor also interferes with learning and 
memory in normal flies. 
These observations in 
Drosophila accord with con- 
clusions reached in studies 
of Aplysia and mammals (see 
text) and have emphasized the 
importance of cAMP-mediated

LTP and LTD are broad terms that describe only the direc- 
tion of change in synaptic efficacy; in fact, different cellular 
and molecular mechanisms can be involved in producing 
LTP or LTD at different synapses thoroughout the brain. In 
general, LTP and LTD are produced by different histories 
of activity and are mediated by different complements of 
intracellular signal transduction pathways in the nerve cells 
involved. 
Long-term synaptic plasticity has been most thor- 
oughly studied at excitatory synapses in the mammalian 
hippocampus. The hippocampus is especially important in 
the formation and/or retrieval of some forms of memory 
(see Chapter 31). In humans, functional imaging shows 
that the hippocampus is activated during certairi kinds of 
memory tasks and that damage to this brain region re- 
sults in an inability to form certain types of new memo- 
ries. In rodents, certain hippocampal neurons fire action

potentials only when an animal is in certain locations. 
Such "place cells" appear to encode spatial memories, 
an interpretation supported by the fact that hippocampal 
damage prevents rats from developing proficiency in spa- 
tial learning tasks (see Figure 31.10). Although many other 
brain areas are involved in the complex process of memory 
formation, storage, and retrieval, these observations have 
led many investigators to study long-term synaptic plas- 
ticity of hippocampal synapses. 
Work on LTP began in the late 1960s, when Terje Lomo 
and Timothy Bliss, working in the laboratory of Per An- 
dersen in Oslo, Norway, discovered that a few seconds 
of high-frequency electrical stimulation can enhance syn- 
aptic transmission in the rabbit hippocampus for days or 
even weeks. More recently, however, progress in under- 
standing the mechanism of LTP has relied heavily on in 
vitro studies of slices of living hippocampus. The arrange- 
ment of neurons allows the hippocampus to be sectioned 
such that most of the relevant circuitry is left intact. In 
such preparations, the cell bodies of the pyramidal neu- 
rons lie in a single densely packed layer that is readily 
apparent (Figure 8.6). This layer is divided into several dis- 
tinct regions, the major ones being CA1 and CAS. "CA" 
refers to cornu Ammonis, Latin for Ammon's horn—the 
ram's horn that resembles the shape of the hippocampus. 
The dendrites of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region form 
a thick band (the stratum radiatum), where they receive 
synapses from Schaffer collaterals, the axons of pyramidal 
cells in the CA3 region. 
Much of the work on LTP has focused on the synap- 
tic connections between the Schaffer collaterals and CA1

pyramidal cells. Electrical stimulation of Schaffer collater- 
als generates excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in 
the postsynaptic CA1 cells (Figure 8.7A,B). If the Schaffer 
collaterals are stimulated only two or three times per min- 
ute, the size of the evoked EPSP in the CA1 neurons re- 
mains constant. However, a brief, high-frequency train of 
stimuli to the same axons causes LTP, which is evident as 
a long-lasting increase in EPSP amplitude (Figure 8.7B,C). 
While the maximum duration of LTP is not known, LTP 
can last for more than a year in some cases (Figure 8.7D). 
The long duration of LTP shows that this form of syn- 
aptic plasticity is capable of serving as a mechanism for 
long-lasting storage of information. LTP occurs at each of 
the three excitatory synapses of the hippocampus shown 
in Figure 8.6, as well as at synapses in a variety of brain 
regions, including the cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum. 
LTP of the Schaffer collateral synapse exhibits several 
properties that make it an attractive neural mechanism for 
information storage. First, LTP requires strong activity in 
both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. If action poten- 
tials in a small number of presynaptic Schaffer collaterals— 
which evokes transmitter release that produces subthresh- 
old EPSPs that would not normally yield LTP—are paired 
with strong depolarization of the postsynaptic CA1 cell, the 
activated Schaffer collateral synapses undergo LTP (Figure 
8.8). This increase in synaptic transmission occurs only if 
the paired activities of the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells 
are tightly linked in time, such that the strong postsynaptic 
depolarization occurs within about 100 ms of transmitter 
release from the Schaffer collaterals. Such a requirement 
for coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity is the 
central postulate of a theory of learning devised by Don- 
ald Hebb in 1949. Hebb proposed that coordinated activity 
of a presynaptic terminal and a postsynaptic neuron would 
strengthen the synaptic connection between them, pre- 
cisely as is observed for LTP. This indicates the involvement 
of a coincidence detector that allows LTP to occur only 
when both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons are active. 
Hebb's postulate has also been useful in thinking about the 
role of neuronal activity in other brain functions, most nota- 
bly development of neural circuits (see Chapter 24). 
A second property that makes it an attractive neural 
mechanism for information storage is that LTP is input spe- 
cific: When LTP is induced by activation of one synapse, it 
does not occur in other, inactive synapses that contact the 
same neuron (see Figure 8.7C). Thus, LTP is restricted to 
activated synapses rather than to all of the synapses on a

given cell (Figure 8.9A). This feature of LTP is con- 
sistent with its involvement in memory formation 
(or at least the selective storage of information at 
synapses). If activation of one set of synapses led

to all other synapses—even inactive ones—being 
eee 
potentiated, it would be difficult to selectively en- 
owe 
hance particular sets of inputs, as is presumably 
required to store specific information. 
Another important property of LTP is asso- 
ciativity (Figure 8.9B). As noted, weak stimula- 
ets 
tion of a pathway will not by itself trigger LTP. 
However, if one pathway is weakly activated at 
the same time that a neighboring pathway onto 
the same cell is strongly activated, both synaptic 
pathways undergo LTP. This selective enhance- 
ment of conjointly activated sets of synaptic inputs 
is often considered a cellular analog of associative 
learning, where two stimuli are required for learn- 
ing to take place. The best-known type of associa- 
tive learning is classical (Pavlovian) conditioning. 
More generally, associativity is expected in any 
network of neurons that links one set of informa- 
tion with another. 
Although there is clearly a gap between under- 
standing LTP of hippocampal synapses and un- 
derstanding learning, memory, or other aspects 
of behavioral plasticity 4 in mammals, this form of

Mechanisms Underlying LTP 
The molecular underpinnings of LTP now are well under- 
stood. A key advance was the discovery that antagonists 
of the NMDA type of glutamate receptor prevent LTP, but 
have no effect on the synaptic response evoked by low- 
frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals. At about 
the same time, the unique biophysical properties of the 
NMDA receptor were first appreciated. As described in 
Chapter 6, the NMDA receptor channel is permeable to 
Ca** but is blocked by Mg**. This property provides a critical 
insight into how LTP is selectively induced by high-fre- 
quency activity. During low-frequency synaptic transmis- 
sion, glutamate released by the Schaffer collaterals binds 
to both NMDA-type and AMPA/kainate-type glutamate 
receptors. While both types of receptors bind glutamate, if 
the postsynaptic neuron is at its normal resting membrane 
potential, the pore of the NMDA receptor channel will be 
blocked by Mg** ions and no current will flow (Figure 8.10, 
left). Under such conditions, the EPSP will be mediated 
entirely by the AMPA receptors. Because blockade of the 
NMDA receptor by Mg** is voltage-dependent, the func- 
tion of the synapse changes markedly when the postsyn- 
aptic cell is depolarized. Thus, high-frequency stimulation 
(as in Figure 8.7) will cause summation of EPSPs, lead- 
ing to a prolonged depolarization that expels Mg** from 
the NMDA channel pore (Figure 8.10, right). Removal of 
Mg?* allows Ca?* to enter the postsynaptic neuron, and 
the resulting increase in Ca** concentration 
within the dendritic spines of the postsyn- 
aptic cell turns out to be the trigger for LTP. 
The NMDA receptor thus behaves like a 
molecular coincidence detector: The chan- 
nel of this receptor opens (to induce LTP) 
only when two events occur simultaneously: 
glutamate is bound to the receptor, and the 
postsynaptic cell is depolarized to relieve the 
Mg** block of the channel pore. 
These properties of the NMDA receptor 
can account for many of the characteristics 
of LTP. First, the requirement for strong 
coincident presynaptic and postsynap- 
tic activity to induce LTP (see Figure 8.8) 
arises because presynaptic activity releases 
glutamate, while the coincident postsynap- 
tic depolarization relieves the Mg** block of 
the NMDA receptor. The specificity of LTP 
(see Figure 8.9A) can be explained by the 
fact that NMDA channels will be opened 
only at synaptic inputs that are active and 
releasing glutamate, thereby confining LTP 
to these sites even though EPSPs generated

The NMDA receptor channel 
can open only during depolarization of 
the postsynaptic neuron from its normal 
resting potential. Depolarization expels 
Mg?* from the NMDA channel, allowing cur- 
rent to flow into the postsynaptic cell. This 
leads to Ca?* entry, which in turn triggers LTP.

(see Figure 8.9B), a weakly stimulated input releases glu- 
tamate but cannot sufficiently depolarize the postsynaptic 
ceil to relieve the Mg** block. If neighboring inputs are 
strongly stimulated, however, they provide the "associa- 
tive" depolarization necessary to relieve the block. 
Several sorts of observations have confirmed that a 
rise in the concentration of Ca** in the postsynaptic CA1 
neuron—the result of Ca?* entering through NMDA re- 
ceptors—serves as a second messenger signal that in- 
duces LTP. Imaging studies have shown that activation 
of NMDA receptors causes increases in postsynaptic Ca** 
levels. Furthermore, injection of Ca** chelators blocks 
LTP induction, whereas elevation of Ca'* levels in post- 
synaptic neurons potentiates synaptic transmission. In 
the postsynaptic neuron, Ca** induces LTP by activating 
complicated signal transduction cascades that include at 
least two Ca'*-activated protein kinases: Ca**/calmodulin- 
dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) and protein kinase C 
(PKC; see Chapter 7). CaMKII, which is the most abun- 
dant postsynaptic protein at Schaffer collateral synapses, 
seems to play an especially important role. This enzyme is 
activated during stimuli that induce LTP (Figure 8.11), and

pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of CaMKII

and many other signaling proteins. 
It appears that the strengthening of synaptic transmis- 
sion during LTP arises from an increase in the sensitivity 
of the postsynaptic cell to glutamate. Several recent obser- 
vations indicate that excitatory synapses can dynamically 
regulate their postsynaptic glutamate receptors and can 
even add new AMPA receptors to "silent" synapses that did 
not previously have postsynaptic AMPA receptors (Box 8B). 
The "expression" or maintenance of LTP apparently is due 
to such insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic 
membrane (as opposed to "induction" of LTP, which relies 
on activation of NMDA receptors). The resulting increase 
in the density of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic spine

BOX 8B Silent Synapses 
SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY

Several observations indicate that 
postsynaptic glutamate receptors are 
dynamically regulated at excitatory 
synapses. Early insight into this process 
came from the finding that stimulation 
of some glutamatergic synapses gener- 
ates no postsynaptic electrical signal 
when the postsynaptic cell is at its nor- 
mal resting membrane potential (Figure 
A). However, once the postsynaptic cell 
is depolarized, these "silent synapses" 
can transmit robust postsynaptic electri- 
cal responses. The fact that transmis- 
sion at such synapses can be turned 
on or off according to the postsynaptic 
membrane potential suggests an inter- 
esting and simple means of modifying 
neural circuitry. 
Silent synapses are especially preva- 
lent in development and have been 
found in many brain regions, includ- 
ing the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, 
and spinal cord. The silence of these 
synapses is evidently due to the voltage- 
dependent blockade of NMDA receptors 
by Mg** (see text and Chapter 6). At the 
normal resting membrane potential, 
presynaptic release of glutamate evokes 
no postsynaptic response at such syn- 
apses because their NMDA receptors are 
blocked by Mg**. However, depolariza- 
tion of the postsynaptic neuron displaces 
the Mg**, allowing glutamate release to 
induce postsynaptic responses mediated 
by NMDA receptors. 
Glutamate released at silent syn- 
apses evidently binds only to NMDA 
receptors. How, then, does glutamate 
release avoid activating AMPA recep- 
tors? The most likely explanation is that 
these synapses may have only NMDA 
receptors. Immunocytochemical experi- 
ments demonstrate that some excitatory 
synapses have only NMDA receptors 
(green spots in Figure B). Such NMDA 
receptor-only synapses are particularly 
abundant early in postnatal develop- 
ment and decrease in adults (Figure 
C). Thus, at least some silent synapses 
are not a separate class of excitatory 
synapses that lack AMPA receptors, 
but rather an early stage in the ongo- 
ing maturation of the glutamatergic 
synapse (Figure D). Evidently, AMPA

increases the response of the postsynaptic cell to released 
glutamate (Figure 8.12A), yielding a strengthening of syn- 
aptic transmission that can last for as long as LTP is main- 
tained (Figure 8.12B). At silent synapses, where synaptic 
activity generates no postsynaptic response at the normal 
resting potential, LTP adds AMPA receptors so that the 
synapse can produce postsynaptic responses (Figure 8.12C). 
In summary, the molecular signaling pathways involved 
in LTP at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse are well 
understood. Ca** entering through postsynaptic NUDA

late trafficking of AMPA receptors, thereby enhancing the 
postsynaptic response to glutamate released from the pre- 
synaptic terminal (Figure 8.13). Under some circumstances, 
LTP also can increase the ability of presynaptic terminals to 
release glutamate. Because LTP clearly is triggered by the 
actions of Ca?* within the postsynaptic neuron, this poten- 
tiation of presynaptic function requires the spread of a ret- 
rograde signal (perhaps NO; see Chapter 6) from the post- 
synaptic spine back to the presynaptic terminals. Still other

forms of LTP are observed at other synapses and, in some 
cases, rely on signaling mechanisms different from those 
involved in LTP at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse. 
The scheme depicted in Figure 8.13 can account for the 
changes in synaptic transmission that occur over the first 
hour or two after LTP is induced. However, there is also a 
later phase of LTP that depends on changes in gene expres- 
sion and the synthesis of new proteins. The contributions 
of this late phase can be observed by treating synapses with 
drugs that inhibit protein synthesis: blocking protein synthe- 
sis prevents LTP measured several hours after a stimulus but 
does not affect LTP measured at earlier times (Figure 8.14). 
This late phase of LTP appears to be initiated by protein ki- 
nase A, which goes on to activate transcription factors such

Signaling mechanisms underlying

as CREB, which stimulate the expression of other 
proteins. Although most of these newly synthesized 
proteins have not yet been identified, they include 
other transcriptional regulators, protein kinases, and 
AMPA receptors (Figure 8.15A). How these proteins 
contribute to the late phase of LTP is not yet known. 
There is evidence that the number and size of syn- 
aptic contacts increases during LTP (Figure 8.15B,C). 
Thus, it is likely that some of the proteins newly syn- 
thesized during the late phase of LTP are involved in 
construction of new synaptic contacts that serve to 
make LTP essentially permanent. 
In conclusion, it appears that LTP in the mam- 
malian hippocampus has many parallels to the long- 
term changes in synaptic transmission underlying 
behavioral sensitization Aplysia. Both consist of an 
early, transient phase that relies on protein kinases to pro- 
duce posttranslational changes in membrane channels, and 
both have later, long-lasting phases that require changes in 
gene expression mediated by CREB. Both forms of long-term 
synaptic plasticity are likely to be involved in long-term stor- 
age of information, although the role of LTP in memory stor- 
age in the hippocampus is not firmly established. 
Mechanisms Underlying LTD 
If synapses simply continued to increase in strength as a re- 
sult of long-term potentiation, eventually they would reach 
some level of maximum efficacy, making it difficult to en- 
code new information. Thus, to make synaptic strengthening

useful, other processes must selectively weaken specific sets 
of synapses and LTD is such a process. In the late 1970s, 
LTD was found to occur at the synapses between the Schaf- 
fer collaterals and the CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippo- 
campus. Whereas LTP at these synapses requires brief, 
FIGURE 8.15

New dendritic spines (white arrows) can be 
observed approximately 1 hour after a stimulus 
that induces LTP. The presence of novel spines 
raises the possibility that LTP may arise, in part, 
from formation of new synapses. (A after Squire 
and Kandel, 1999; B and C after Engert and 
Bonhoeffer, 1999.) 
high-frequency stimulation, LTD occurs when 
the Schaffer collaterals are stimulated at a low 
rate—about 1 Hz—for long periods (10-15 min- 
utes). This pattern of activity depresses the EPSP 
for several hours and, like LTP, is specific to the 
activated synapses (Figure 8.16A,B). Moreover, 
LTD can erase the increase in EPSP size due to 
LTP, and, conversely, LTP can erase the decrease 
in EPSP size due to LTD. This complementar- 
ity suggests that LTD and LTP reversibly affect 
synaptic efficiency by acting at a common site. 
LTP and LTD at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 
synapses actually share several key elements. 
Both require activation of NMDA-type gluta- 
mate receptors and the resulting entry of Ca?* 
into the postsynaptic cell. The major determi- 
nant of whether LTP or LTD arises appears to 
be the nature of the Ca* signal in the postsyn- 
aptic cell: small and slow rises in Ca?* lead to 
depression, whereas large and fast increases in 
Ca** trigger potentiation. As noted above, LTP 
is at least partially due to activation of protein 
kinases, which phosphorylate their target pro- 
teins. LTD, on the other hand, appears to result from activa- 
tion of Ca**-dependent phosphatases that cleave phosphate 
groups from these target molecules (see Chapter 7). Evi- 
dence in support of this idea is that phosphatase inhibitors.

Ca** during LTD and LTP may arise from the selective acti- 
vation of protein phosphatases and kinases by the different 
types of Ca?* signals. Although the phosphatase substrates 
important for LTD have not yet been identified, it is possi- 
ble that LTP and LTD phosphorylate and dephosphorylate 
the same set of regulatory proteins to control the efficacy of 
transmission at the Schaeffer collateral-CA1 synapse. Just 
as LTP at this synapse is associated with insertion of AMPA 
receptors, LTD is often associated with a loss of synaptic 
AMPA receptors. This loss probably arises from internaliza- 
tion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic cell (Figure 
8.16C), due to the same sort of clathrin-dependent endo- 
cytosis mechanisms important for synaptic vesicle recycling 
in the presynaptic terminal (see Chapter 5). 
A quite different form of LTD is observed in the cer- 
ebellum. LTD of synaptic inputs onto cerebellar Purkinje 
cells was first described by Masao Ito and his colleagues in

Japan in the early 1980s. Purkinje neurons in the cer- 
ebellum receive two distinct types of excitatory input: 
climbing fibers and parallel fibers (Figure 8.17A; see 
Chapter 19). LTD reduces the strength of transmis- 
sion at the parallel fiber synapse (Figure 8.17B) and 
has recently been found to depress transmission at the 
climbing fiber synapse as well. This form of LTD has 
been implicated in the motor learning that mediates 
the coordination, acquisition, and storage of complex 
movements within the cerebellum. Although the role 
of LTD in cerebellar motor learning remains contro- 
versial, it has nonetheless been a useful model system 
for understanding the cellular mechanisms of long- 
term synaptic plasticity. 
Cerebellar LTD is associative because it occurs only 
when climbing fibers and parallel fibers are activated at the 
same time (Figure 8.17C). In this case, associativity arises 
from the combined actions of two distinct intracellular sig- 
nal transduction pathways that are activated in the post- 
synaptic Purkinje cell due to the activity of climbing fiber 
and parallel fiber synapses. In the first pathway, glutamate 
released from the parallel fiber terminals activates at two 
types of receptors, the AMPA-type and metabotropic glu- 
tamate receptors (see Chapter 6). Glutamate binding to 
the AMPA receptor results in membrane depolarization, 
whereas binding to the metabotropic receptor produces the 
second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP,) and diacylg- 
lycerol (DAG) (see Chapter 7). The second signal transduc- 
tion pathway, initiated by climbing fiber activation, causes 
an influx of Ca** through voltage-gated channels and a sub- 
sequent increase in intracellular Ca** concentration. These

depolarization of the Purkinje cell, produced by climbing

lel fiber synapses. (D) Mechanism underlying cerebellar LTD. 
Glutamate released by parallel fibers activates both AMPA 
receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). 
The activated mGluRs produce two second messengers, 
DAG and IP,, which interact with Ca"* that enters when 
climbing fiber activity opens voltage-gated Ca?* channels. 
The resultant release of Ca** from the endoplasmic reticu- 
lum leads to a further rise in intracellular Ca2* concentration 
and the activation of PKC, which triggers clathrin-dependent 
internalization of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, weakening 
the parallel fiber synapse. (B after Sakurai, 1987.)

second messengers work together to cause an amplified rise in in- 
tracellular Ca** concentration, due to IP, and Ca** acting together on 
IP, receptors, triggering release of Ca** from intracellular stores, and 
the synergistic activation of PKC by Ca** and DAG (Figure 8.17D). 
Thus, the associative property of cerebellar LTD appears to arise 
from both IP, receptors and PKC serving as coincidence detectors. 
Although the downstream substrate proteins of PKC are still being 
determined, it appears that AMPA receptors are one of the proteins 
phosphorylated by PKC. The consequence of PKC activation is to 
cause an internalization of AMPA receptors via clathrin-dependent 
endocytosis (Figure 8.17D). This loss of AMPA receptors decreases 
the response of the postsynaptic Purkinje cell to glutamate released 
from the presynaptic terminals of the parallel fibers. Thus, in contrast 
to LTD in the hippocampus, cerebellar LTD requires the activity of 
a protein kinase, rather than a phosphatase, and does not involve

Ca** entry through the NMDA type of glutamate receptor 
(which is not present in mature Purkinje cells). However, 
the net effect is the same in both cases: internalization of 
AMPA receptors is a common mechanism for decreased ef- 
ficacy of both hippocampal and cerebellar synapses during 
LTD. As was the case for LTP at the hippocampal Schaffer 
collateral synapse, as well as for long-term synaptic plastic- 
ity in Aplysia, CREB appears to be required for a late phase 
of cerebellar LTD. It is not yet know which proteins are 
synthesized as a consequence of CREB activation. 
SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY

FIGURE 8.18 
Spike-timing dependent 
synaptic plasticity in cultured hippo- 
campal neurons. (A) The left-hand graph 
shows that stimulating a presynaptic neuron 
(Pre) causes an EPSP in the postsynaptic neu- 
ron; applying a subsequent stimulus to the 
postsynaptic neuron (Post) causes an action 
potential that is superimposed on the EPSP. 
The right-hand graph reveals that repetitive 
application of this stimulus paradigm causes 
a long-term potentiation (LTP) of the EPSP. (B) 
Reversing the order of stimulation, so that the 
postsynaptic neuron is excited before the pre- 
synaptic neuron, causes LTD of the EPSP. (C) 
Complex dependence of STDP on the interval 
between presynaptic activity and postsynaptic 
activity. If the presynaptic neuron is activated 
40 ms or less before the postsynaptic neuron, 
then LTP occurs. Conversely, if the postsynap- 
tic neuron is activated 40 ms or less before the 
presynaptic neuron, LTD occurs. If the interval 
between the two events is longer than 40 ms, 
e 
no STDP is observed. (After Bi and Poo, 1998.) 
Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity 
The preceding sections show that LTP and LTD are pref- 
erentially initiated by different rates of repetitive synaptic 
activity, with LTP requiring high-frequency activity and 
LTD being induced by low-frequency activity. However, 
the precise temporal relationship between activity in the 
pre- and postsynaptic cells is also an important determinant 
of the amount and direction of long-term synaptic plastic- 
ity. Ata given (low) frequency of synaptic activity, LTD will 
occur if presynaptic activity is preceded by a postsynaptic 
action potential, while LTP occurs if the postsynaptic action 
potential follows presynaptic activity (Figure 8.18A,B). The 
relationship between the time interval and the magnitude 
of the synaptic change is a very sensitive function of the 
time interval, with no changes observed if the presynaptic 
and postsynaptic activities are separated by 100 millisec- 
onds or longer (Figure 8.18C). 
Because precise timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic 
activity determines the polarity of these forms of long- 
lasting synaptic plasticity, they are called spike-timing 
dependent plasticity (STDP). Although the mecha- 
nisms involved are not yet well understood, it appears 
that the properties of STDP arise from timing-dependent 
differences in postsynaptic Ca** signals. Specifically, if 
a postsynaptic action potential occurs after presynaptic 

182 
CHAPTER 8 
activity, the resulting depolarization will relieve the block 
of NMDA receptors by Mg** and cause a relatively large 
amount of Ca?* influx through postsynaptic NMDA recep- 
tors, yielding LTP. In contrast, if the postsynaptic action 
potential occurs prior to the presynaptic action potential, 
then the depolarization associated with the postsynaptic 
action potential will subside by the time an EPSP occurs. 
This sequence of events will reduce the amount of Ca** 
entry through the NMDA receptors, leading to LTD. It 
has been postulated that other signals, such as endocan- 
nibinoids (see Chapter 6), may also be required for LTD 
induction during STDP. 
The requirement for a precise temporal relationship 
between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity means 
that STDP can perform several novel types of neuronal 
Epilepsy is a brain disorder characterized by peri- 
odic and unpredictable seizures mediated by the 
rhythmic firing of large groups of neurons. It seems 
_ likely that abnormal activity generates plastic 
changes in cortical circuitry that are critical to the 
pathogenesis of the disease. 
The importance of neuronal plasticity in epilepsy 
is indicated most clearly by an animal model of sei- 
zure production called kindling. To induce kindling, a 
stimulating electrode is implanted in the brain, often 
in the amygdala (a component of the limbic system 
that makes and receives connections with the cortex, 
thalamus, and other limbic structures, including the 
hippocampus; see Chapter 29). At the beginning of 
such an experiment, weak electrical stimulation, in 
_ 
the form of a low-amplitude train of electrical pulses, 
has no discernible effect on the animal's behavior or 
on the pattern of electrical activity in the brain (labo- 
ratory rats or mice have typically been used for such 
studies). As this weak stimulation is repeated once a 
day for several weeks, it begins to produce behavior- 
al and electrical indications of seizures. By the end of 
the experiment, the same weak stimulus that initially 
had no effect now causes full-blown seizures. This 
phenomenon is essentially permanent; even after an 
interval of a year, the same weak stimulus will again 
trigger a seizure. Thus, repetitive weak activation 
produces long-lasting changes in the excitability of 
the brain that time cannot reverse. The word kindling 
Electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during a seizure. The 
traces show rhythmic activity that persisted much longer than 
the duration of this record. This abnormal pattern reflects the 
synchronous firing of large numbers of cortical neurons. (The 
designations are various positions of electrodes on the head; 
see Box 28C.) (After Dyro, 1989.)

computation. STDP can provide a means of encoding in- 
formation about causality. For example, if a synapse gen- 
erates a suprathreshold EPSP, the resulting postsynaptic 
action potential would rapidly follow presynaptic activ- 
ity, and the resulting LTP would encode the fact that the 
postsynaptic action potential resulted from the activity 
of that synapse. STDP could also serve as a mechanism 
for competition between synaptic inputs: stronger inputs 
would be more likely to preduce suprathreshold EPSPs 
and be reinforced by the resulting LTP, whereas weaker 
inputs would not generate postsynaptic action potentials 
that were correlated with presynaptic activity. There is evi- 
dence that STDP is important for neural circuit function, 
such as determining orientation maps in the visual system 
(see Chapter 12).

In summary, activity-dependent forms of synaptic plas- 
ticity cause changes in synaptic transmission that modify 
the functional connections within and among neural cir- 
cuits. These changes in the efficacy and local geometry 
of synaptic connectivity can provide a basis for learning, 
memory, and other forms of brain plasticity. Activity- 
dependent changes in synaptic transmission may also 
be involved in some pathologies. Abnormal patterns of 
neuronal activity, such as those that occur in epilepsy, 
can stimulate abnormal changes in synaptic connections 
that may further increase the frequency and severity of 
seizures (Box 8C). Despite the substantial advances in 
understanding the cellular and molecular bases of some 
forms of plasticity, the means by which selective changes 
of synaptic strength encode memories or other complex

behavioral modifications in the mammalian brain is sim- 
ply not known. 
Summary 
Synapses exhibit many forms of plasticity that occur over 
a broad temporal range. At the shortest times (seconds 
to minutes), facilitation, augmentation, potentiation, and 
depression provide rapid but transient modifications in 
synaptic transmission. These forms of plasticity change 
the amount of neurotransmitter released from presynap- 
tic terminals and are based on alterations in Ca** signal- 
ing and synaptic vesicle pools at recently active terminals. 
Longer-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity such as LTP and 
LTD are also based on Ca** and other intracellular second

is therefore quite appropriate—a single 
match can start a devastating fire. 
_ 
The changes in the electrical patterns 
of brain activity detected in kindled 
animals resemble those in human epi- 
lepsy. The behavioral manifestations 
of epileptic seizures in human patients 
range from mild twitching of an 
extremity to loss of consciousness and 
uncontrollable convulsions. Although 
many highly accomplished people 
have suffered from epilepsy (Alexander 
the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, 
Dostoyevsky, and van Gogh, to name a 
few), seizures of sufficient intensity and 
frequency obviously can interfere with 
many aspects of daily life. Moreover, 
uncontrolled convulsions can lead to 
excitotoxicity (see Box 6C). As much as 
1% of the population is afflicted, mak- 
ing epilepsy one of the most common 
neurological problems. 
Modern thinking about the causes 
(and possible cures) of epilepsy has 
focused on where seizures originate 
and the mechanisms that make the 
_ affected region hyperexcitable. Most of 
the evidence suggests that abnormal 
activity in small areas of the cerebral 
cortex (called foci) provide the triggers 
for a seizure that then spreads to other 
synaptically connected regions. For 
example, a seizure originating in the 
thumb area of the right motor cortex 
will first be evident as uncontrolled 
movement of the left thumb that subse- 
quently extends to other more proximal 
limb muscles, whereas a seizure origi- 
nating in the visual association cortex of 
the right hemisphere may be heralded 
by complex hallucinations in the left 
visual field. The behavioral manifes- 
tations of seizures therefore provide 
important clues for the neurologist 
seeking to pinpoint the abnormal 
region of cerebral cortex. 
Epileptic seizures can be caused by a 
variety of acquired or congenital factors, 
including cortical damage from trauma, 
stroke, tumors, congenital cortical dys- 
genesis (failure of the cortex to grow 
properly), and congenital vascular mal- 
formations. One rare form of epilepsy, 
Rasmussen's encephalitis, is an auto- 
immune disease that arises when the 
immune system attacks the brain, using 
both humoral agents (i.e., antibodies) 
and cellular agents (lymphocytes and 
macrophages) that can destroy neurons. 
Some forms of epilepsy are heritable, 
and more than a dozen distinct genes 
have been demonstrated to underlie 
unusual types of epilepsy. However, 
most forms of familial epilepsy (such as 
juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and petit 
mal epilepsy) are caused by the simul- 
taneous inheritance of more than one 
mutant gene. 
No effective prevention or cure exists 
for epilepsy. Pharmacological thera- 
pies that successfully inhibit seizures 
are based on two general strategies. 
One approach is to enhance the func- 
tion of inhibitory synapses that use the 
neurotransmitter GABA; the other is to 
limit action potential firing by acting on 
voltage-gated Na* channels. Commonly 
used antiseizure medications include 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenyt- 
oin (Dilantin®), and valproic acid. These 
agents, which must be taken daily, suc- 
cessfully inhibit seizures in 60-70% of 
patients. In a small fraction of patients, 
the epileptogenic region can be surgical- 
ly excised. In extreme cases, physicians 
resort to cutting the corpus callosum 
to prevent the spread of seizures (most 
of the "split-brain" subjects described 
in Chapter 27 suffered from intractable 
epilepsy). One of the major reasons for 
controlling epileptic activity is to prevent 
the more permanent plastic changes that 
would ensue as a consequence of abnor- 
mal and excessive neural activity.

messengers. At least some of the synaptic changes pro- 
duced by these long-lasting forms of plasticity are post- 
synaptic, caused by changes in neurotransmitter receptor 
trafficking, although alterations in neurotransmitter release 
from the presynaptic terminal can also occur. In these more 
enduring forms of plasticity, protein phosphorylation and 
changes in gene expression greatly outlast the period of 
synaptic activity and can yield changes in synaptic strength 
that persist for hours, days, or even longer. Long-lasting 
synaptic plasticity can serve as a neural mechanism for 
many forms of brain plasticity, such as learning new be- 
haviors or acquiring new memories.

Processing 
SENSATION ENTAILS THE ABILITY to transduce, encode, 
and ultimately perceive information generated by stimuli aris- 
ing from both the external and internal environments. Much of 
the brain is devoted to these tasks. Although the basic senses— 
Somatic sensation, vision, audition, vestibular sensation, and 
the chemical senses—are very different from one another, a 
few fundamental rules govern the way the nervous system 
deals with each of these diverse modalities. Highly specialized 
nerve cells called receptors convert the energy associated with 
mechanical forces, light, sound waves, odorant molecules, or 
ingested chemicals into neural signals—afferent sensory sig- 
nals—that convey information about the stimulus to the brain. 
Afferent sensory signals activate central neurons capable of rep- 
resenting both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the 
stimulus (what it is and how strong it is) and, in some modali- 
ties (somatic sensation, vision, and audition) the location of the 
stimulus in space (where it is). 
The clinical evaluation of patients routinely requires an 
assessment of the sensory systems to infer the nature and loca- 
tion of potential neurological problems. Knowledge of where 
and how the different sensory modalities are transduced, 
relayed, represented, and further processed to generate appro- 
priate behavioral responses is therefore essential to understand- 
ing and treating a wide variety of diseases. Accordingly, these 
chapters on the neurobiology of sensation also introduce some 
of the major structure/function relationships in the sensory 
components of the nervous system.

THE SOMATIC SENSORY 
SYSTEM: [OUCH AND 
PROPRIOCEPTION 
Overview 
THE SOMATIC SENSORY SYSTEM is arguably the most diverse of the sensory 
systems, mediating a range of sensations—touch, pressure, vibration, limb position, 
heat, cold, and pain—that are transduced by receptors within the skin or muscles and 
conveyed to a variety of central nervous system targets. Not surprisingly, this complex 
neurobiological machinery can be divided into functionally distinct subsystems with 
distinct sets of peripheral receptors and central pathways. One subsystem transmits 
information from cutaneous mechanoreceptors and mediates the sensations of fine 
touch, vibration, and pressure. Another originates in specialized receptors that are as- 
sociated with muscles, tendons, and joints and is responsible for proprioception—our 
ability to sense the position of our own limbs and other body parts in space. A third 
subsystem arises from receptors that supply information about painful stimuli and 
changes in temperature as well as coarse touch. This chapter focuses on the tactile 
and proprioceptive subsystems; the mechanisms responsible for sensations of pain, 
temperature, and coarse touch are considered in the following chapter. 
Afferent Fibers Convey Somatic Sensory Information 
to the Central Nervous System 
Somatic sensation originates from the activity of afferent nerve fibers whose periph- 
eral processes ramify within the skin or in muscle (Figure 9.1A). The cell bodies of 
afferent fibers reside in a series of ganglia that lie alongside the spinal cord and the 
brainstem and are considered part of the peripheral nervous system. Neurons in the 
dorsal root ganglia and in the cranial nerve ganglia (for the body and head, respec- 
tively) are the critical links supplying central nervous system circuits with information 
about sensory events that occur in the periphery. 
Action potentials generated in afferent fibers by events that occur in the skin or in 
muscle propagate along the fiber and past the location of the cell body in the ganglia un- 
til they reach the fibers' synaptic terminals, which are located in various target structures

Peripheral and central components of af-

For this reason, neurons in the dorsal root 
ganglia are often called pseudounipolar.

of the cell body is not an obligatory step in 
conveying sensory information to central 
targets. Nevertheless, cell bodies of sensory 
afferents play a critical role in maintaining 
the cellular machinery that mediates trans- 
duction, conduction, and transmission by 
sensory afferent fibers. 
The fundamental mechanism of sen- 
sory transduction—the process of con- 
verting the energy of a stimulus into an 
electrical signal—is similar in all somatic 
sensory afferents: a stimulus alters the per- 
meability of cation channels in the afferent 
nerve endings, generating a depolarizing

Somatosensory afferents convey information from the skin surface 
to central circuits. (A) The cell bodies of somatic sensory afferent fibers conveying infor- 
mation about the body reside in a series of dorsal root ganglia that lie along the spinal 
cord; those conveying information about the head are found primarily in the trigeminal 
ganglia. (B) Pseudounipolar neurons in the dorsal root ganglia give rise to peripheral 
processes that ramify within the skin (or muscle) and central processes that synapse with 
neurons located in the spinal cord and at higher levels of the nervous system. The periph- 
eral processes of mechanoreceptor afferents are encapsulated by specialized receptor 
cells; afferents carrying pain and temperature information terminate as free endings.

Transduction ina mechanosensory afferent. The process is illustrated 
here for a Pacinian corpuscle. (A) Deformation of the capsule leads to a stretching of the 
membrane of the afferent fiber, increasing the probability of opening stretch-sensitive 
cation channels in the membrane. (B) Opening of cation channels leads to depolariza- 
tion of the afferent fiber (receptor potential). If the afferent is sufficiently depolarized, an 
action potential is generated and propagates to central targets.

current known as a receptor (or generator) potential (Fig- 
ure 9.2). If sufficient in magnitude, the receptor potential 
reaches threshold for the generation of action potentials in 
the afferent fiber; the resulting rate of action potential firing 
is roughly proportional to the magnitude of the depolariza- 
tion, as described in Chapters 2 and 3. 
Afferent fibers are often encapsulated by specialized re- 
ceptor cells called mechanoreceptors that help tune the af- 
ferent fiber to particular features of somatic stimulation. Af- 
ferent fibers that lack specialized receptor cells are referred 
to as free nerve endings and are especially important in 
the sensation of pain (see Chapter 10). Afferents that have 
encapsulated endings generally have lower thresholds for 
action potential generation and are thus are more sensitive 
to sensory stimulation than are free nerve endings. 
Somatic Sensory Afferents Exhibit 
Distinct Functional Properties 
Somatic sensory afferents differ significantly in their re- 
sponse properties. These differences, taken together, define 
distinct classes of afferents, each of which makes unique

fact of development explains the over- 
all segmental arrangement of somatic 
_ nerves and the targets they innervate 
in the adult. The territory innervated 
by each spinal nerve is called a derma- 
tome. In humans, the cutaneous area of 
each dermatome has been defined in 
patients in whom specific dorsal roots

were affected (as in herpes zoster, or 
"shingles") or after surgical interruption 
(for relief of pain or other reasons). Such 
studies show that dermatomal maps 
vary among individuals. Moreover, der- 
matomes overlap substantially, so that 
injury to an individual dorsal root does 
not lead to complete loss of sensation 
in the relevant skin region. The over- 
lap is more extensive for sensations of 
touch, pressure, and vibration than for 
pain and temperature. Thus, testing for

pain sensation provides a more precise 
assessment of a segmental nerve injury 
than does testing for responses to touch, 
pressure, or vibration. The segmental 
distribution of proprioceptors, however, 
does not follow the dermatomal map 
but is more closely allied with the pat- 
tern of muscle innervation. Despite these 
limitations, knowledge of dermatomes 
is essential in the clinical evaluation of 
neurological patients, particularly in 
determining the level of a spinal lesion. 
The innervation arising from a single dorsal root ganglion and 
its spinal nerve is called a dermatome. The full set of sensory 
dermatomes is shown here for a typical adult. Knowledge of 
this arrangement is particularly important in defining the loca- 
tion of suspected spinal (and other) lesions. The numbers refer 
to the spinal segments by which each nerve is named. (After 
Rosenzweig et al., 2002.)

contributions to somatic sensation. Axon diameter is one 
factor that differentiates classes of somatic sensory affer- 
ents (Table 9.1). The largest-diameter sensory afferents 
(designated Ia) are those that supply the sensory receptors 
in the muscles. Most of the information subserving touch is 
conveyed by slightly smaller diameter fibers (AB afferents), 
and information about pain and temperature is conveyed 
by even smaller diameter fibers (A8 and C). The diameter of 
the axon determines the action potential conduction speed 
and is well matched to the properties of the central circuits 
and the various behavior demands for which each type of 
sensory afferent is employed (see Chapter 16). 
Another distinguishing feature of sensory afferents is the 
size of the receptive field—the area of the skin surface 
over which stimulation results in a significant change in 
the rate of action potentials (Figure 9.3A). A given region 
of the body surface is served by sensory afferents that vary

sensory afferent fibers with overlapping receptive fields a, b, 
and c on the skin surface. When two-point discrimination stimuli 
are closely spaced (green dots and histogram), there is a single 
focus of neural activity, with afferent b firing most actively. As 
the stimuli are moved farther apart (red dots and histogram), 
the activity in afferents a and c increases and the activity in b 
decreases. At some separation distance (blue dots and histo- 
gram), the activity in a and c exceeds that in b to such an extent 
that two discrete foci of stimulation can be identified. This dif- 
ferential pattern of activity forms the basis for the two-point dis- 
crimination threshold. (B) The two-point discrimination thresh- 
old in the fingers is much finer than that in the wrist because 
of differences in the sizes of afferent receptive fields—that is, 
the separation distance necessary to produce two distinct foci 
of neural activity in the population of afferents innervating the 
wrist is much greater than that for the afferents innervating the 
fingertips. (C) Differences in the two-point discrimination thresh-

in the fingers, toes, and face than in the arms, legs, or torso.

"During the 1920s and 1930s, there was a virtual cottage industry classifying axons according to their conduction velocity. Three main categories were 
discerned, called A, B, and C. A comprises the largest and fastest axons, C the smallest and slowest. Mechanoreceptor axons generally fall into category A. 
The A group is further broken down into subgroups designated a (the fastest), B, and 8 (the slowest). To make matters even more confusing, muscle afferent 
axons are usually classified into four additional groups—I (the fastest), II, IIL, and IV (the slowest)—with subgroups designated by lowercase roman letters! 
(After Rosenzweig et al., 2005.) 
significantly in the size of their receptive fields. The size 
of the receptive field is largely a function of the branching 
characteristics of the afferent within the skin; smaller arbo- 
rizations result in smaller receptive fields. Moreover, there 
are systematic regional variations in the average size of af- 
ferent receptive fields that reflect the density of afferent fi- 
bers supplying the area. The receptive fields in regions with 
dense innervation (fingers, lips, toes) are relatively small 
compared with those in the forearm or back that are inner- 
vated by a smaller number of afferent fibers (Figure 9.3B). 
Stimulus 
Slowly adapting 
Rapidly adapting 
Regional differences in receptive field size and innervation 
density are the major factors that limit the spatial accuracy 
with which tactile stimuli can be sensed. Thus, measures of 
two-point discrimination—the minimum interstimulus 
distance required to perceive two simultaneously applied 
stimuli as distinct—vary dramatically across the skin sur- 
face (Figure 9.3C). On the fingertips, stimuli (the indenta- 
tion points produced by the tips of a caliper, for example) are 
perceived as distinct if they are separated by roughly 2 mm, 
but the same stimuli applied to the forearm are not perceived 
as distinct until they are at least 40 mm apart! 
Sensory afferents are further differentiated by the tempo- 
ral dynamics of their response to sensory stimulation. Some 
afferents fire rapidly when a stimulus is first presented, then 
fall silent in the presence of continued stimulation; others 
generate a sustained discharge in the presence of an on- 
going stimulus (Figure 9.4). Rapidly adapting afferents 
(those that become quiescent in the face of continued stim- 
ulation) are thought to be particularly effective in conveying 
FIGURE 9.4 
Slowly and rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors provide 
different information. Slowly adapting receptors continue responding to a 
stimulus, whereas rapidly adapting receptors respond only at the onset (and often 
the offset) of stimulation. These functional differences allow mechanoreceptors 
to provide information about both the static (via slowly adapting receptors) and 
Time (s) 
dynamic (via rapidly adapting receptors) qualities of a stimulus. 

194 
CHAPTER 9 
information about changes in ongoing stimulation such as 
those produced by stimulus movement. In contrast, slowly 
adapting afferents are better suited to provide information 
about the spatial attributes of the stimulus, such as size and 
shape. At least for some classes of afferent fibers, the adap- 
tation characteristics are attributable to the properties of the 
receptor cells that encapsulate it. Rapidly adapting afferents 
that are associated with Pacinian corpuscles (see below) be- 
come slowly adapting when the corpuscle is removed. 
Finally, sensory afferents respond differently to the qual- 
ities of somatic sensory stimulation. Due to differences in 
the properties of the channels expressed in sensory affer- 
ents, and/or to the filter properties of the specialized recep- 
tor cells that encapsulate many sensory afferents, generator 
potentials are produced only by a restricted set of stimuli 
that impinge on a given afferent fiber. For example, the af- 
ferents encapsulated within specialized receptor cells in the 
skin respond vigorously to mechanical deformation of the 
skin surface, but not to changes in temperature or to the 
presence of mechanical forces or chemicals that are known 
to elicit painful sensations. The latter stimuli are especially 
effective in driving the responses of sensory afferents known 
as nociceptors (see Chapter 10) that terminate in the skin as 
free nerve endings. Further subtypes of mechanoreceptors

and nociceptors are identified on the basis of their distinct 
responses to somatic stimulation. 
While a given sensory afferent can give rise to multiple 
peripheral branches, the transduction properties of all the 
branches of a single fiber are identical. As a result, somatic 
sensory afferents constitute parallel pathways that dif- 
fer in conduction velocity, receptive field size, dynamics, 
and effective stimulus features. As will become apparent, 
these different pathways remain segregated through several 
stages of central processing, and their activity contributes in 
unique ways to the extraction of somatosensory informa- 
tion that is necessary for the appropriate control of both 
goal-oriented and reflexive movements. 
Mechanoreceptors Specialized to 
Receive Tactile Information 
Our understanding of the contribution of distinct afferent 
pathways to cutaneous sensation is best developed for the 
glabrous (hairless) portions of the hand (i.e., the palm and 
the fingertips). These regions of the skin surface are special- 
ized to provide a high-definition neural image of manipu- 
lated objects. Active touching, or haptics, involves the in- 
terpretation of complex spatiotemporal patterns of stimuli 
that are likely to activate many classes of mechanoreceptors. 
Indeed, manipulating an object with the hand can often pro- 
vide enough information to identify the object, a capacity 
called stereognosis. By recording the responses of individual 
sensory afferents in the nerves of humans and non-human 
primates, it has been possible to characterize the responses of 
these afferents under controlled conditions and gain insights 
into their contribution to somatic sensation. Here 
we consider four distinct classes of mechanorecep- 
tive afferents that innervate the glabrous skin of 
the hand (Figure 9.5; Table 9.2). 
Merkel cell afferents are slowly adapting 
fibers that account for about 25% of the mecha- 
nosensory afferents in the hand. They are espe- 
cially enriched in the fingertips, and are the only 
afferents to sample information from receptor 
cells located in the epidermis. Merkel cell—neu- 
rite complexes lie in the tips of the primary epi- 
dermal ridges—extensions of the epidermis into

the underlying dermis that coincide with the prominent 
ridges ("fingerprints") on the finger surface. The exact role 
of Merkel cells in somatosensory transduction remains un- 
clear. Merkel cells are excitable cells that express voltage- 
sensitive calcium channels and molecules that are required 
for synaptic vesicle release. However, action potentials ap- 
pear to arise from mechanosensitive ion channels in the 
membrane of the afferent fiber, suggesting that Merkel cells 
serve to modulate the activity of the afferents rather than as 
the site of transduction. Merkel cell afferents have the high- 
est spatial resolution of all the sensory afferents—individual 
Merkel afferents can resolve spatial details of 0.5 mm. They 
are also highly sensitive to points, edges, and curvature, 
which makes them ideally suited for processing information 
about form and texture. 
Meissner afferents are rapidly adapting fibers that in- 
nervate the skin even more densely than Merkel afferents, 
accounting for about 40% of the mechanosensory innerva- 
tion of the human hand. Meissner corpuscles lie in the tips 
of the dermal papillae adjacent to the primary ridges and 
closest to the skin surface (see Figure 9.5). These elongated 
receptors are formed by a connective tissue capsule that 
comprises several lamellae of Schwann cells. The center of 
the capsule contains 2-6 afferent nerve fibers that terminate 
as disks between the Schwann cell laminae, a configuration 
thought to contribute to the transient response of these af- 
ferents to somatic stimulation. Due at least in part to their 
close proximity to the skin surface, Meissner afferents are 
more than four times as sensitive to skin deformation as 
Merkel afferents; however, their receptive fields are larger 
than those of Merkel afferents, and thus they transmit sig- 
nals with reduced spatial resolution (see Table 9.2). 
Meissner corpuscles are particularly efficient in transduc- 
ing information about the relatively low-frequency vibra- 
tions (3-40 Hz) that occur when textured objects are moved 
across the skin. Several lines of evidence suggest that the 
information conveyed by Meissner afferents is responsible 
for detecting slippage between the skin and an object held 
in the hand, essential feedback information for the efficient 
control of grip. 
Pacinian afferents are rapidly adapting fibers that make 
up 10-15% of the mechanosensory innervation in the hand. 
Pacinian corpuscles are located deep in the dermis or in 
the subcutaneous tissue; their appearance resembles that 
of a small onion, with concentric layers of membranes sur- 
rounding a single afferent fiber (see Figure 9.5). This laminar 
capsule acts as a filter, allowing only transient disturbances 
at high frequencies (250-350 Hz) to activate the nerve end- 
ings. Pacinian corpuscles adapt more rapidly than Meissner 
corpuscles and have a lower response threshold. The most 

196 
CHAPTER 9 
sensitive Pacinian afferents generate action potentials for 
displacements of the skin as small as 10 nanometers. Be- 
cause they are so sensitive, the receptive fields of Pacinian 
afferents are often large and their boundaries are difficult 
to define. The properties of Pacinian afferents make them 
well suited to detect vibrations transmitted through objects 
that contact the hand or are being grasped in the hand—no 
doubt important for the skilled use of tools (e.g., using a 
wrench, cutting bread with a knife, writing). 
Ruffini afferents are slowly adapting fibers and are 
the least understood of the cutaneous mechanoreceptors. 
Ruffini endings are elongated, spindle-shaped, capsular 
specializations located deep in the skin, as well as in liga- 
ments and tendons (see Figure 9.5). The long axis of the 
corpuscle is usually oriented parallel to the stretch lines in 
skin; thus, Ruffini corpuscles are particularly sensitive to 
the cutaneous stretching produced by digit or limb move- 
ments; they account for about 20% of the mechanorecep- 
tors in the human hand. Although there is still some ques- 
tion as to their function, Ruffini corpuscles are thought to 
be especially responsive to internally generated stimuli, 
such as the movement of the fingers. Information supplied 
by Ruffini afferents contributes, along with muscle recep- 
tors, to providing an accurate representation of finger posi- 
tion and the conformation of the hand (see the following 
section on proprioception). 
The different kinds of information that sensory af- 
ferents convey to central structures is nicely illustrated in

experiments conducted by K. O. Johnson and colleagues, 
who compared the responses of different afferents as a fin- 
gertip was moved across a row of raised Braille letters (Fig- 
ure 9.6). Clearly, all of the afferent types are activated by this 
stimulation, but the information supplied by each type varies 
enormously. The pattern of activity in the Merkel afferents is 
sufficient to recognize the details of the Braille pattern, and 
the Meissner afferents supply a slightly coarser version of 
this pattern. But these details are lost in the response of the 
Pacinian and Ruffini afferents; presumably these responses 
have more to do with tracking the movement and position 
of the finger than with the specific identity of the Braille 
characters. 
Mechanoreceptors Specialized for 
Proprioception 
While cutaneous mechanoreceptors provide information 
derived from external stimuli, another major class of recep- 
tors provides information about mechanical forces arising 
within the body itself, particularly from the musculoskeletal 
system. The purpose of these proprioceptors ("receptors for 
self") is primarily to give detailed and continuous informa- 
tion about the position of the limbs and other body parts in 
space. Low-threshold mechanoreceptors, including muscle 
spindles, Golgi tendon organs, and joint receptors, provide 
this kind of sensory information, which is essential to the 
accurate performance of complex movements. Information 
about the position and motion of the head is particularly 
important; in this case, proprioceptors are integrated with 
the highly specialized vestibular system, which is considered 
FIGURE 9.6 
Simulation of activity patterns in dif- 
ferent mechanosensory afferents in the fingertip. 
Each dot in the response records represents an action 
potential recorded from a single mechanosensory affer- 
ent fiber innervating the human finger as it moves across 
a row Of Braille type. A horizontal line of dots in the raster 
plot represents the pattern of activity in the afferent as a 
result of moving the pattern from left to right across the 
finger. The position of the pattern (relative to the tip of 
the finger) was then displaced by a small distance, and 
the pattern was once again moved across the finger. 
Repeating this pattern multiple times produces a record 
that simulates the pattern of activity that would arise in 
a population of afferents whose receptive fields lie along 
a line in the fingertip (red dots). Only slowly adapting 
Merkel cell afferents (top panel) provide a high-fidelity 
representation of the Braille pattern—that is, the individ- 
ual Braille dots can be distinguished only in the pattern of 
Merkel afferent neural activity. (After Phillips et al., 1990.)

exist in the heart and major blood vessels to provide infor- 
mation about blood pressure, but these neurons are consid- 
ered to be part of the visceral motor system; see Chapter 21.) 
The most detailed knowledge about proprioception de- 
rives from studies of muscle spindles, which are found in 
all but a few striated (skeletal) muscles. Muscle spindles 
consist of four to eight specialized intrafusal muscle fibers 
surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue. The intrafusal 
fibers are distributed among and in a parallel arrangement 
with the extrafusal fibers of skeletal muscle, which are the 
true force-producing fibers (Figure 9.7A). Sensory afferents 
are coiled around the central part of the intrafusal spindle 
and, when the muscle is stretched, the tension on the in- 
trafusal fibers activates mechanically gated ion channels in 
the nerve endings, triggering action potentials. Innervation 
of the muscle spindle arises from two classes of fibers: pri- 
mary and secondary endings. Primary endings arise from

the largest myelinated sensory axons (group Ia afferents) 
and have rapidly adapting responses to changes in muscle 
length; in contrast, secondary endings (group II afferents) 
produce sustained responses to constant muscle lengths. 
Primary endings are thought to transmit information about 
limb dynamics—the velocity and direction of movement— 
whereas secondary endings provide information about the 
static position of limbs. 
Changes in muscle length are not the only factors im- 
pacting the response of spindle afferents. The intrafusal 
fibers are themselves contractile muscle fibers and are con- 
trolled by a separate set of motor neurons (y motor neu- 
rons) that lie in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Whereas 
intrafusal fibers do not add appreciably to the force of mus- 
cle contraction, changes in the tension of intrafusal fibers 
have significant impact on the sensitivity of the spindle af- 
ferents to changes in muscle length. Thus, in order for cen-

and movement, the level of activity in the y system must 
be taken into account. (For a more detailed explanation of 
the interaction of the y system and the activity of spindle 
afferents, refer to Chapters 16 and 17.) 
The density of spindles in human muscles varies. Large 
muscles that generate coarse movements have relatively 
few spindles; in contrast, extraocular muscles and the in- 
trinsic muscles of the hand and neck are richly supplied 
with spindles, reflecting the importance of accurate eye 
movements, the need to manipulate objects with great fi- 
nesse, and the continuous demand for precise positioning 
of the head. This relationship between receptor density and 
muscle size is consistent with the generalization that the 
sensory motor apparatus at all levels of the nervous sys- 
tem is much richer for the hands, head, speech organs, and 
other parts of the body that are used to perform especially 
important and demanding tasks. Spindles are lacking alto- 
gether in a few muscles, such as those of the middle ear, 
which do not require the kind of feedback that these recep- 
tors provide. 
Whereas muscle spindles are specialized to signal 
changes in muscle length, low-threshold mechanorecep- 
tors in tendons inform the central nervous system about 
changes in muscle tension. These mechanoreceptors, called 
Golgi tendon organs, are formed by branches of group Ib 
afferents distributed among the collagen fibers that form 
the tendons (Figure 9.7B). Each Golgi tendon organ is ar- 
ranged in series with a small number (10-20) of extrafusal 
muscle fibers. Taken together, the population of Golgi ten- 
don organs for a given muscle provides an accurate sample 
of the tension that exists in the muscle. 
How each of these proprioceptive afferents contributes 
to the perception of limb position, movement, and force 
remains an area of active investigation. Experiments using 
vibrators to stimulate the spindles of specific muscles have 
provided compelling evidence that the activity of these af- 
ferents can give rise to vivid sensations of movement in 
immobilized limbs. For example, vibration of the biceps 
muscle leads to the illusion that the elbow is moving to an 
extended position, as if the biceps is being stretched. Simi- 
lar illusions of motion have been evoked in postural and 
facial muscles. In some cases, the magnitude of the effect 
is so great that it produces a percept that is anatomically 
impossible; for example, when an extensor muscle of the 
wrist is vigorously vibrated, subjects report that the hand 
is hyperextended to the point where it is almost in contact 
with the back of the forearm. In all such cases, the illu- 
sion occurs only if the subject is blindfolded and cannot see 
the position of the limb, demonstrating that even though 
proprioceptive afferents alone can provide cues about limb 
position, under normal conditions both somatic and visual 
cues play important roles. 
Prior to these studies, the primary source of propriocep- 
tive information about limb position and movement was 
thought to arise from mechanoreceptors in and around 
joints. These joint receptors resemble many of the recep- 
tors found in the skin, including Ruffini endings and Pacin- 
ian corpuscles. However, individuals who have had artificial 
joint replacements were found to exhibit only minor deficits 
in judging the position or motion of limbs, and anesthetiz- 
ing a joint such as the knee has no effect on judgments of 
the joint's position or movement. Although they make little 
contribution to limb proprioception, joint receptors appear 
to be important for judging position of the fingers. Along 
with cutaneous signals from Ruffini afferents and input 
from muscle spindles that contribute to fine representation 
of finger position, joint receptors appear to play a protective 
role in signaling positions that lie near the limits of normal 
finger joint range of motion. 
Central Pathways Conveying 
Tactile Information from the Body: 
The Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscal 
System 
The axons of cutaneous mechanosensory afferents enter 
the spinal cord through the dorsal roots; the majority as- 
cend ipsilaterally through the dorsal columns (also called 
the posterior funiculi) of the cord to the lower medulla, 
where they synapse on neurons in the dorsal column nu- 
clei (Figure 9.8A). The term "column" refers to the gross 
columnar appearance of these fibers as they run the length 
of the spinal cord. These first-order neurons in the pathway 
can have quite long axonal processes: neurons innervating 
the lower extremities, for example, have axons that extend 
through the entire length of the cord. 
The dorsal columns of the spinal cord are topographi- 
cally organized such that the fibers conveying information 
from lower limbs lie most medial and travel in a circum- 
scribed bundle known as fasciculus gracilis (Latin fascicu- 
lus, "bundle"; gracilis, "slender"), while those that convey 
information from the upper limbs, trunk, and neck lie in 
a more lateral bundle known as the fasciculus cuneatus 
("wedge-shaped bundle"). In turn, the fibers in these two 
tracts end in different subdivisions of the dorsal column 
nuclei: a medial subdivision, the nucléus gracilis; and a 
lateral subdivision, the nucleus cuneatus. 
The second-order neurons in the dorsal column nuclei send 
their axons to the somatic sensory portion of the thalamus. 
The axons exiting from dorsal column nuclei are identified 
as the internal arcuate fibers. The internal arcuate fibers 
subsequently cross the midline and then form a dorsoven- 
trally elongated tract known as the medial lemniscus. The 
word lemniscus means "ribbon"; the crossing of the internal 
arcuate fibers is called the decussation of the medial lemnis- 
cus, from the Roman numeral X, or decem (10). In a cross- 
section through the medulla, such as the one shown in

CHAPTER 9 
Figure 9.8A, the medial lemniscal axons carrying informa- 
tion from the lower limbs are located ventrally, whereas the 
axons related to the upper limbs are located dorsally. As the 
medial lemniscus ascends through the pons and midbrain, 
it rotates 90 degrees laterally, so that the fibers representing 
the upper body are eventually located 
in the medial portion 
of the tract and those representing the lower body are in the 
lateral portion. The axons of the medial lemniscus synapse 
with thalamic neurons located in the ventral posterior lat- 
eral nucleus (VPL). 
Third-order neurons in the VPL send their axons via the 
internal capsule to terminate in the postcentral gyrus 
of the cerebral cortex, a region known as the primary so- 
matosensory cortex, or SI. Neurons in the VPL also send 
axons to the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), a 
smaller region that lies in the upper bank of the lateral 
sulcus. 
Central Pathways Conveying Tactile 
Information from the Face: 
The Trigeminothalamic System 
Cutaneous mechanoreceptor information from the face is 
conveyed centrally by a separate set of first-order neu- 
rons that are located in the trigeminal (cranial nerve 
V) ganglion (Figure 9.8B). The peripheral processes of 
these neurons form the three main subdivisions of the tri- 
geminal nerve (the ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular 
branches). Each branch innervates a well-defined territory 
on the face and head, including the teeth and the mu- 
cosa of the oral and nasal cavities. The central processes 
of trigeminal ganglion cells form the sensory roots of the 
trigeminal nerve; they enter the brainstem at the level 
of the pons to terminate on neurons in the trigeminal 
brainstem complex. 
The trigeminal complex has two major components: 
the principal nucleus and the spinal nucleus. (A third 
component, the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus, will be 
considered separately later.) Most of the afferents convey- 
ing information from low-threshold cutaneous mechano- 
receptors terminate in the principal nucleus. In effect, this 
nucleus corresponds to the dorsal column nuclei that relay 
mechanosensory information from the rest of the body. 
The spinal nucleus contains neurons that are sensitive to 
pain, temperature, and coarse touch and will be discussed 
more fully in Chapter 10. The second-order neurons of 
the trigeminal brainstem nuclei give off axons that cross 
the midline and ascend to the ventral posterior medial 
(VPM) nucleus of the thalamus by way of the trigem- 
inothalamic tract (also called the trigeminal lemniscus). 
Neurons in the VPM send their axons to cortical areas SI 
and SII. 
Central Pathways Conveying 
Proprioceptive Information 
from the Body 
Like their counterparts for cutaneous sensation, the axons 
of proprioceptive afferents enter the spinal cord through the 
dorsal roots and, for much of their course, travel with the 
axons conveying cutaneous information. However, some dif- 
ferences in the spinal cord routes for proprioceptive pathways 
reflect the important role proprioceptive information plays in 
the reflex regulation of motor control as well as perception. 
First, when they enter the spinal cord, many of the fi- 
bers from proprioceptive afferents bifurcate into ascend- 
ing and descending branches, which in turn send collateral 
branches to several spinal segments (Figure 9.9). Some col- 
lateral branches penetrate the dorsal horn of the spinal cord 
and synapse on neurons located there, as well as on neu- 
rons in the ventral horn. These synapses mediate, among 
other things, segmental reflexes such as the "knee-jerk" or 
myotatic reflex described in Chapter 1; Chapters 16 and 17 
describe these reflexes in more detail. 
Second, the information supplied by proprioceptive af- 
ferents is important not only for our ability to sense limb po- 
sition; it is also essential for the functions of the cerebellum, 
a structure that regulates the timing of muscle contractions 
necessary for the performance of voluntary movements. As 
a consequence, proprioceptive information reaches higher 
cortical circuits as branches of pathways that are also target- 
ing the cerebellum, and some of these axons run through 
spinal cord tracts whose names reflect their association with 
this structure. 
The association with cerebellar pathways is especially 
clear for the route that conveys proprioceptive informa- 
tion for the lower part of the body to the dorsal column 
nuclei. First-order proprioceptive afferents that enter the 
spinal cord between the mid-lumbar and thoracic levels 
(L2-T1) synapse on neurons in Clarke's nucleus, located 
in the medial aspect of the dorsal horn (see Figure 9.9, 
red pathway). Afferents that enter below this level ascend 
through the dorsal column and then synapse with neurons 
in Clarke's nucleus. Second-order neurons in Clarke's nu- 
cleus send their axons into the ipsilateral posterior lateral 
column of the spinal cord, where they travel up to the level 
of the medulla in the dorsal spinocerebellar tract. These ax- 
ons continue into the cerebellum, but in their course, give 
off collaterals that synapse with neurons lying just outside 
the nucleus gracilus (for the present purpose, "propriocep- 
tive neurons" of the dorsal column nuclei). Axons of these 
third-order neurons decussate and join the medial lemnis- 
cus, accompanying the fibers from cutaneous mechanore- 
ceptors in their course to the VPL of the thalamus.: 
First-order proprioceptive afferents from the upper 
limbs have a course that is similar to that of cutaneous

mechanoreceptors (see Figure 9.9, blue pathway). They 
enter the spinal cord and travel via the dorsal column (fas- 
cilus cuneatus) up to the level of the medulla, where they 
synapse on proprioceptive neurons in the dorsal column 
nuclei. Second-order neurons send their axons across the 
midline, where they join the medial lemniscus and ascend 
to the VPL of the thalamus. 
Central Pathways Conveying 
Proprioceptive Information 
from the Face 
Like the information from cutaneous mechanoreceptors, 
proprioceptive information from the face is conveyed 
through the trigeminal nerve. However, the cell bodies of 
the first-order proprioceptive neurons for the face have 
an unusual location: instead of residing in the trigeminal 
ganglia, they are found within the central nervous sys- 
tem, in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, a well- 
defined cluster of netirons lying at the lateral extent of the

afferents for the lower part of the body syn-

of the spinal cord and on neurons in Clarke's

axons via the dorsal spinocerebellar tract to 
the dorsal column nuclei and the cerebellum. 
Proprioceptive afferents for the upper body 
also have synapses in the dorsal and ventral 
horns, but then ascend via the dorsal column 
to the cerebellum and to the dorsal column 
nuclei. Proprioceptive target neurons in the

central gray region of the midbrain. Like 
their counterparts in the trigeminal and 
dorsal root ganglia, these pseudounipolar 
neurons have peripheral processes that in- 
organs associated with facial musculature 
(especially the jaw muscles) and central 
processes that include projections to brain- 
stem nuclei responsible for reflex control of 
facial muscles. Although the exact route is 
not clear, information from proprioceptive 
afferents in the mesencephalic trigeminal 
nucleus also reaches the thalamus and is 
represented in somatic sensory cortex. 
The Somatic Sensory Components 
of the Thalamus 
Each of the several ascending somatic sensory pathways 
originating in the spinal cord and brainstem converge on the 
ventral posterior complex of the thalamus and terminate 
in an organized fashion (Figure 9.10). One of the organiza- 
tional features of this complex instantiated by the pattern of 
afferent terminations is a complete and orderly somatotopic 
representation of the body and head. As already mentioned, 
the more laterally located ventral posterior lateral nucleus 
(VPL) receives projections from the medial lemniscus carry- 
ing somatosensory information from the body and posterior 
head whereas the more medially located ventral posterior 
medial nucleus (VPM) receives axons from the trigeminal 
lemniscus conveying somatosensory information from the 
face. In addition, inputs carrying different types of somato- 
sensory information—for example, those that respond to 
different types of mechanoreceptors, to muscle spindle af- 
ferents, or to Golgi tendon organs—terminate on separate

Primary Somatic Sensory Cortex 
The majority of the axons arising from neurons in the 
ventral posterior complex of the thalamus project to cor- 
tical neurons located in layer 4 of the primary somatic 
sensory cortex (see Box 26A for a description of cortical 
lamination). The primary somatic sensory cortex in 
humans (also called SI) is located in the postcentral gyrus 
of the parietal lobe and comprises four distinct regions, 
or fields, known as Brodmann's areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2 
(Figure 9.11A). Mapping studies in humans and other 
primates show further that each of these four cortical 
areas contains a separate and complete representation

Chapter 19). (After Penfield et al., 1953 and Corsi, 1991.)

rangement, as shown in Figure 9.11B. 
A salient feature of somatotopic maps, recognized soon 
after their discovery, is their failure to represent the hu- 
man body in its actual proportions. When neurosurgeons

man") defined by such mapping procedures had a grossly 
enlarged face and hands compared to the torso and proxi- 
mal limbs (Figure 9.11C). These anomalies arise because 
manipulation, facial expression, and speech are extraor- 
dinarily important for humans and require a great deal of 
circuitry, both central and peripheral, to govern them. Thus, 
in humans, the cervical spinal cord is enlarged to accommo- 
date the extra circuitry related to the hand and upper limb 
and, as stated earlier, the density of receptors is greater in 
regions such as the hands and lips. 
Such distortions are also apparent when topographical 
maps are compared across species. In the rat brain, for ex- 
ample, an inordinate amount of the somatic sensory cortex 
BOX 9B Patterns of Organization within the Sensory Cortices: Brain Modules 
is devoted to representing the large facial whiskers that are 
key components of the somatic sensory input for rats and 
mice (Box 9B), while raccoons overrepresent their paws and 
the platypus its bill. In short, the sensory input (or motor 
output) that is particularly significant to a given species gets 
relatively more cortical representation. 
Although the topographic organization of the several 
somatic sensory areas is similar, the functional properties 
of the neurons in each region are distinct. Experiments 
carried out in non-human primates indicate that neurons 
in areas 3b and 1 respond primarily to cutaneous stimuli, 
whereas neurons in 3a respond mainly to stimulation of 
proprioceptors; area 2 neurons process both tactile and 
Observations over the last 40 years 
have made it clear that there is an iter- 
ated substructure within the somatic 
sensory (and many other) cortical 
maps. This substructure takes the form 
of units called modules, each involving 
hundreds or thousands of nerve cells in 
repeating patterns. The advantages of 
these iterated patterns for brain func- 
tion remain largely mysterious; for the 
neurobiologist, however, such iterated 
arrangements have provided important 
clues about cortical connectivity and 
the mechanisms by which neural activ- 
ity influences brain development (see 
Chapters 23 and 24). 
The observation that the somatic 
sensory cortex comprises elementary 
units of vertically linked cells was first 
noted in the 1920s by the Spanish 
neuroanatomist Rafael Lorente de 
N6, based on his studies in the rat. 
The potential importance of cortical 
modularity remained largely unex- 
plored until the 1950s, however, when 
electrophysiological experiments 
indicated an arrangement of repeat- 
_ ing units in the brains of cats and, 
- 
later, monkeys. Vernon Mountcastle, 
a neurophysiologist at Johns Hopkins 
University School of Medicine, found 
that vertical microelectrode penetra- 
tions in the primary somatosensory 
cortex of these animals encountered 
cells that responded to the same sort 
of mechanical stimulus presented at 
the same location on the body surface. 
Soon after Mountcastle's pioneering 
work, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel 
discovered a similar arrangement in the 
cat primary visual cortex. These and 
other observations led Mountcastle to 
the general view that "the elementary 
pattern of organization of the cerebral 
cortex is a vertically oriented column or 
cylinder of cells capable of input-output 
functions of considerable complexity." 
Since these discoveries in the late 1950s 
and early 1960s, the view that modular 
circuits represent a fundamental feature 
of the mammalian cerebral cortex has 
gained wide acceptance, and many such 
entities have now been described in 
various cortical regions (see figure). 
This wealth of evidence for such 
patterned circuits has led many neuro- 
scientists to conclude, like Mountcastle,

- that modules are a fundamental feature 
of the cerebral cortex, essential for per- 
ception, cognition, and perhaps even 
_ consciousness. Despite the prevalence 
of iterated modules, there are some 
problems with the view that modular 
units are universally important in corti- 
cal function. First, although modular 
circuits of a given class are readily seen 
in the brains of some species, they 
have not been found in the same brain 
regions of other, sometimes closely 
related, animals. Second, not all regions 
of the mammalian cortex are organized 
- ina modular fashion. And third, no 
_ clear function of such modules has been 
_ discerned, much effort and speculation 
_ notwithstanding. This salient feature of 
cortex and other cortical (and some 
subcortical) regions therefore remains a 
tantalizing puzzle.

Connections within the somatosensory cor- 
tex establish functional hierarchies. Inputs from the ventral 
posterior complex of the thalamus terminate in Brodmann's 
areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2, with the greatest density of projections in 
area 3b. Area 3b in turn projects heavily to areas 1 and 2, and the 
functions of these areas are dependent on the activity of area 3b.

connections between SI areas contributes significantly to 
the elaboration of SI response properties. Area 3b receives 
the bulk of the input from the ventral posterior complex 
and provides a particularly dense projection to areas 1 and 
2. This arrangement of connections establishes a functional 
hierarchy in which area 3b serves as an obligatory first 
step in cortical processing of somatosensory information 
(Figure 9.12). Consistent with this view, lesions of area 3b 
in non-human primates result in profound deficits in all 
forms of tactile sensations mediated by cutaneous mecha- 
noreceptors, while lesions limited to areas 1 or 2 result in 
partial deficits and an inability to use tactile information to 
discriminate either the texture of objects (area 1 deficit) or 
the size and shape of objects (area 2 deficit). 
Even finer parcellations of functionally distinct neuronal 
populations exist within single cortical areas. Based on his 
analysis of electrode penetrations in primary somatosensory 
cortex, Vernon Mountcastle was the first to suggest that 
neurons with similar response properties might be clustered 
together into functionally distinct "columns" that traverse 
the depth of the cortex. Subsequent studies of finely spaced 
electrode penetrations in area 3b provided strong evidence 
in support of this idea, demonstrating that neurons with re- 
sponses to rapidly and slowly adapting mechanoreceptors 
were clustered into separate zones within the representation 
of a single digit (Figure 9.13). Similar clusters of neurons 
responding preferentially to different somatosensory affer- 
ents have been described in areas 2 and 1. This modular 
organization of cortical areas, a fundamental feature of cor- 
tical organization, is especially pronounced in visual corti- 
cal areas (see Chapter 11). Although these patterns reflect 
specificity in the underlying patterns of thalamocortical and

Beyond SI: Corticocortical and 
Descending Pathways 
Somatic sensory information is distributed from the primary 
somatic sensory cortex to "higher order" cortical fields. One 
of these higher order cortical centers, the secondary so- 
matosensory cortex (SII), lies in the upper bank of the 
lateral sulcus (see Figures 9.10 and 9.11). SII receives con- 
vergent projections from all subdivisions of SI, and these 
inputs are necessary for the function of SII; lesions of SI

eliminate the somatosensory responses of SII neurons. Area 
SII sends projections in turn to limbic structures such as the 
amygdala and hippocampus (see Chapters 29 and 31). This 
latter pathway is believed to play an important role in tactile 
learning and memory. 
Neurons in SI also project to parietal areas posterior to 
area 2, especially areas 5a and 7b. These areas receive direct 
projections from area 2 and, in turn, supply inputs to neurons 
in motor and premotor areas of the frontal lobe. This is a 
major route by which information derived from propriocep- 
tive afferents signaling the current state of muscle contraction 
gains access to circuits that initiate voluntary movements. 
More generally, the projections from parietal cortex to mo- 
tor cortex are critical for the integration of sensory and mo- 
tor information (see Chapters 20 and 26, which consider the 
functions of "association" regions of the cerebral cortex). 
Finally, a fundamental but often neglected feature of the 
somatic sensory system is the presence of massive descend- 
ing projections. These pathways originate in sensory cortical 
fields and run to the thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord. 
Indeed, descending projections from the somatic sensory 
cortex outnumber ascending somatic sensory pathways. 
Although their physiological role is not well understood, 
it is generally assumed (with some experimental support) 
that descending projections modulate the ascending flow 
of sensory information at the level of the thalamus and 
brainstem.

CHAPTER 9 
Plasticity in the Adult Cerebral Cortex 
The analysis of maps of the body surface in primary so- 
matic sensory cortex and the responses to altered patterns 
of activity in peripheral afferents has been instrumental in 
understanding the potential for the reorganization of corti- 
cal circuits in adults. Jon Kaas and Michael Merzenich were 
the first to explore this issue, by examining the impact of 
peripheral lesions (e.g., cutting a nerve that innervates the 
hand, or amputation of a digit) on the topographic maps 
in somatosensory cortex. Immediately after the lesion, the 
corresponding region of the cortex was found to be unre- 
sponsive. After a few weeks, however, the unresponsive 
area became responsive to stimulation of neighboring re- 
gions of the skin (Figure 9.14). For example, if the third digit 
was amputated, cortical neurons that formerly responded to 
stimulation of digit 3 now responded to stimulation of digits 
2 or 4. Thus, the central representation of the remaining 
digits had expanded to take over the cortical territory that 
had lost its main input. Such "functional re-mapping" also 
occurs in the somatic sensory nuclei in the thalamus and 
brainstem; indeed, some of the reorganization of cortical 
circuits may depend on this concurrent subcortical plastic- 
ity. This sort of adjustment in the somatic sensory system 
may contribute to the altered sensation of phantom limbs 
after amputation (see Box 10D). Similar plastic changes 
have been demonstrated in the visual, auditory, and mo- 
tor cortices, suggesting that some ability to reorganize after 
peripheral deprivation or injury is a general property of the 
mature neocortex. 
Appreciable changes in cortical representation also can 
occur in response to physiological changes in sensory or 
motor experience. For instance, if a monkey is trained to 
use a specific digit for a particular task that is repeated many 
times, the functional representation of that digit, deter- 
mined by electrophysiological mapping, can expand at the 
expense of the other digits (Figure 9.15). In fact, significant 
changes in receptive fields of somatic sensory neurons can

be detected when a peripheral nerve is blocked temporar- 
ily by a local anesthetic. The transient loss of sensory input 
from a small area of skin induces a reversible reorganiza- 
tion of the receptive fields of both cortical and subcortical 
neurons. During this period, the neurons assume new re- 
ceptive fields that respond to tactile stimulation of the skin 
surrounding the anesthetized region. Once the effects of 
the local anesthetic subside, the receptive fields of corti- 
cal and subcortical neurons return to their usual size. The 
common experience of an anesthetized area of skin feeling 
disproportionately large—as experienced, for example, fol- 
lowing dental anesthesia—may be a consequence of this 
temporary change. 
Despite these intriguing observations, the mechanism, 
purpose, and significance of the reorganization of sensory 
and motor maps that occurs in adult cortex are not known. 
Clearly, changes in cortical circuitry occur in the adult brain. 
Centuries of clinical observations, however, indicate that 
these changes may be to be of limited value for recovery of 
function following brain injury, and they may well lead to 
symptoms that detract from rather than enhance the qual- 
ity of life following neural damage. Given their rapid and 
reversible character, most of these changes in cortical func- 
tion probably reflect alterations in the strength of synapses 
already present. Indeed, finding ways to prevent or redirect 
the synaptic events that underlie injury-induced plasticity 
could reduce the long-term impact of acute brain damage. 
Summary 
The components of the somatic sensory system process in- 
formation conveyed by mechanical stimuli that either im- 
pinge on the body surface (cutaneous mechanoreception) 
or are generated within the body itself (proprioception). 
Somatic sensory processing is performed by neurons dis- 
tributed across several brain structures that are connected 
by both ascending and descending pathways. Transmission 
of afferent mechanosensory information from the periph- 
ery to the brain begins with a variety of receptor types that 
initiate action potentials. This activity is conveyed centrally 
via a chain of nerve cells, referred to as the first-, second-, 
and third-order neurons. First-order neurons are located 
in the dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia. Second-order 
neurons are located in brainstem nuclei. Third-order neu- 
rons are found in the thalamus, from whence they project 
to the cerebral cortex. These pathways are topographically 
arranged throughout the system, the amount of cortical 
and subcortical space allocated to various body parts being 
proportional to the density of peripheral receptors. Stud- 
ies of non-human primates show that specific cortical re- 
gions correspond to each functional submodality; area 3b, 
for example, processes information from low-threshold 
cutaneous receptors, while area 3a processes inputs from 
proprioceptors. Thus, at least two broad criteria operate in 
the organization of the somatic sensory system: modality 
and somatotopy. The end result of this complex interaction 
is the unified perceptual representation of the body and its 
ongoing interaction with the environment.

PAIN 
Overview 
ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE NATURAL TO ASSUME that the sensations associated 
with injurious stimuli arise from excessive stimulation of the same receptors that 
generate other somatic sensations (i.e., those discussed in Chapter 9), this is not the 
case. The perception of injurious stimuli, called nociception, depends on specifically 
dedicated receptors and pathways. Moreover, the response of an organism to nox- 
ious stimuli is multidimensional, involving discriminative, affective, and motivational 
components. The central distribution of nociceptive information is correspondingly 
complex, involving multiple areas in the brainstem, thalamus, and forebrain. The 
overriding importance of pain in clinical practice (both as a diagnostic and as a focus 
of treatment) as well as the many aspects of pain physiology and pharmacology that 
remain imperfectly understood continue to make nociception an extremely active 
area of research. 
Nociceptors 
The relatively unspecialized nerve cell endings that initiate the sensation of pain are 
called nociceptors (Latin nocere, "to hurt"). Like other cutaneous and subcutaneous 
receptors, nociceptors transduce a variety of stimuli into receptor potentials, which 
in turn trigger afferent action potentials. Moreover, nociceptors, like other somatic 
sensory receptors, arise from cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia (or in the trigeminal 
ganglion) that send one axonal process to the periphery and the other into the spinal 
cord or brainstem (see Figure 9.1). 
Because peripheral nociceptive axons terminate in morphologically unspecial- 
ized "free endings," it is conventional to categorize nociceptors according to the 
properties of the axons associated with them (see Table 9.1). As described in Chap- 
ter 9, the somatic sensory receptors responsible for the perception of innocuous 
mechanical stimuli are associated with myelinated axons that have relatively rapid 
conduction velocities. The axons associated with nociceptors, in contrast, conduct 
relatively slowly, being only lightly myelinated or, more commonly, unmyelinated. 
Accordingly, axons conveying information about pain fall into either the A8 group 
of myelinated axons, which conduct at 5-30 m/s, or into the C fiber group of

unmyelinated axons, which conduct at velocities generally 
less than 2 m/s. Thus, even though the conduction of all 
nociceptive information is relatively slow, pain pathways 
can be either fast or slow. 
Studies carried out in both humans and experimental 
animals demonstrated some time ago that the rapidly con- 
ducting axons that subserve somatic sensation are not in- 
volved in the transmission of pain. Figure 10.1 illustrates 
a typical experiment of this sort. The peripheral axons re- 
sponsive to nonpainful mechanical or thermal stimuli do 
not discharge at a greater rate when painful stimuli are de- 
livered to the same region of the skin surface. The nocicep- 
tive axons, on the other hand, begin to discharge only when 
the strength of the stimulus (a thermal stimulus in the ex- 
ample in Figure 10.1) reaches high levels; at this same stim- 
ulus intensity, other thermoreceptors discharge at a rate no 
different from the maximum rate already achieved within 
the nonpainful temperature range, indicating the presence 
of both nociceptive and non-nociceptive thermoreceptors. 
Equally important, direct stimulation of the large-diameter 
somatic sensory afferents at any frequency in humans does 
not produce sensations that subjects describe as painful. In 
contrast, the smaller diameter, more slowly conducting A& 
and C fibers are active when painful stimuli are delivered; 
when stimulated electrically in human subjects, these fibers 
produce sensations of pain.

How, then, do these different classes of nociceptors lead 
to the perception of pain? As mentioned, one way of de- 
termining the answer has been to stimulate different noci- 
ceptors in human volunteers while noting the sensations 
reported. In general, two categories of pain perception have 
been described: a sharp first pain and a more delayed, dif- 
fuse, and longer-lasting sensation that is generally called 
second pain (Figure 10.2A). Stimulation of the large, rap- 
idly conducting Aa and Af axons in peripheral nerves does 
not elicit the sensation of pain. When investigators raise 
the stimulus intensity to a level that activates a subset of 
A6 fibers, however, a tingling sensation or, if the stimula- 
tion is intense enough, a feeling of sharp pain is reported. 
If the stimulus intensity is increased still further, so that 
the small-diameter, slowly conducting C-fiber axons are 
brought into play, then subjects report a duller, longer- 
lasting sensation of pain. It is also possible for researchers 
to selectively anesthetize C fibers and Aé8 fibers; in general, 
these selective blocking experiments confirm that Aé fibers 
are responsible for first pain and C fibers are responsible 
for the duller, longer-lasting second pain (Figure 10.2B,C). 
The faster-conducting AS nociceptors are now known 
to fall into two main classes. Type I Aé fibers respond to 
dangerously intense mechanical and chemical stimulation 
but have relatively high heat thresholds, while type II A8- 
fibers have complementary sensitivities—i.e., much lower 
thresholds for heat, but very high thresholds for mechanical 
stimulation. Thus, the Aé system has specialized pathways 
for the transmission of heat and mechanical nociceptive 
stimuli. Most of the slower-conducting, unmyelinated C- 
fiber nociceptors respond to all forms of nociceptive stim- 
uli—thermal, mechanical, and chemical—and are therefore 
said to be polymodal. However, C-fiber nociceptors are also 
heterogeneous, with subsets that respond preferentially to 
heat or chemical stimulation rather than mechanical stimu-. 
lation. Further subtypes of C-fiber nociceptors are especially

responsive to chemical irritants, acidic substances, or cold. 
In short, each of the major classes of nociceptive afferents 
is composed of multiple subtypes with distinct sensitivity 
profiles. 
Transduction and Transmission of 
Nociceptive Signals 
Given the variety of stimuli (mechanical, thermal, and 
chemical) that can give rise to painful sensations, the 
transduction of nociceptive signals is a complex task. While 
many puzzles remain, significant insights have come from 
the identification of a specific receptor associated with the 
sensation of noxious heat. The threshold for perceiving a 
thermal stimulus as noxious is around 43°C (110°F), and 
this pain threshold corresponds with the sensitivity of sub- 
types of A8- and C-fiber nociceptive endings. The receptor 
that confers this sensitivity to heat also confers sensitivity 
to capsaicin, the ingredient in chili peppers responsible for 
the tingling or burning sensation produced by spicy foods 
(Box 10A). The so-called vanilloid receptor (TRPV1), found 
in both C and AS fibers, is a member of the larger family of 
transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, first identi- 
fied in studies of the phototransduction pathway in fruit 
flies and now known to comprise a large number of recep- 
tors sensitive to different ranges of heat and cold. Struc- 
turally, TRP channels resemble voltage-gated potassium 
PAIN 
211 
or cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, having six transmem- 
brane domains with a pore between domains 5 and 6. Un- 
der resting conditions, the pore of the channel is closed. In 
the open, activated state, these receptors allow an influx of 
sodium and calcium that initiates the generation of action 
potentials in the nociceptive fibers. Since the same receptor 
is responsive to heat as well as capsaicin, it is not surprising 
that many people experience the taste of chili peppers as 
"hot." A puzzle, however, is why the nervous system has 
evolved receptors that are sensitive to a chemical in chili 
peppers. As is the case with other plant compounds that 
selectively activate neural receptors (see the discussion of 
opioids, pp. 224-225), it seems likely that TRPV1 receptors 
detect endogenous substances whose chemical structure 
resembles that of capsaicin. In fact, some recent evidence 
suggests that "endovanilloids" are produced by peripheral 
tissues in response to injury and that these substances, 
along with other factors, contribute to the nociceptive re- 
sponse to injury. 
The receptors responsible for the transduction of me- 
chanical and chemical forms of nociceptive stimulation are 
less well understood. A number of different candidates for 
mechanotransducers have been identified, including other 
members of the TRP family (TRPV2 and TRPA1) and some 
members of the ASIC (acid-sensing ion channels) family. 
TRP channels also appear to be responsible for the detec- 
tion of chemical irritants in the-environment. TRPA1 in par- 
ticular has been shown to be sensitive to a diverse group 
of chemical irritants, including the pungent ingredients in 
mustard and garlic plants, as well as volatile irritants pres- 
ent in tear gas, vehicle exhaust, and cigarettes. The ASIC3 
channel subtype is specifically expressed in nociceptors and 
is well represented in fibers that innervate skeletal and car- 
diac muscle. ASIC3 channels are thought to be responsible 
for the muscle or cardiac pain that results from changes in 
pH associated with ischemia. The complex molecular basis

When applied to the mucus mem- 
branes of the oral cavity, capsaicin acts 
as an irritant, producing protective 
reactions. When injected into skin, it 
produces a burning pain and elicits 
hyperalgesia to thermal and mechani- 
cal stimuli. Repeated applications of 
capsaicin also desensitize pain fibers 
and prevent neuromodulators such as 
substance P, VIP, and somatostatin 
from being released by peripheral and 
central nerve terminals. Consequently, 
capsaicin is used clinically as an anal- 
gesic and anti-inflammatory agent; it 
is usually applied topically in a cream 
(0.075%) to relieve the pain associated 
with arthritis, postherpetic neuralgia,

of mechano- and chemonociception is an area of active in- 
vestigation and is critical for understanding the initial steps 
in the neural pathways that contribute to pain. 
The graded potentials arising from receptors in the distal 
branches of nociceptive fibers must be transformed into ac- 
tion potentials in order to be conveyed to synapses in the 
dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Voltage-gated sodium and 
potassium channels are critical in this process (see Chapter 
4), and one specific subtype of sodium channel—Nav1.7— 
appears to be especially important for the transmission of 
nociceptive information. Altered activity of NavT.7 is re- 
sponsible for a variety of human pain disorders. Mutations 
of the NAV1.7 gene that lead to a loss of this channel's 
function result in an inability to detect noxious stimulation, 

while mutations leading to hyperexcitability of the chan- 
nel are associated with pain disorders that cause intense 
burning sensations. The NAV1.8 gene is highly expressed 
by most C-fiber nociceptors and, based on studies in mice, 
the protein has been associated with the transmission of 
noxious mechanical and thermal information. The devel- 
opment of local anesthetics specific to these subtypes of 
sodium channels may hold the key for treating a variety of 
intractable pain syndromes. 
Central Pain Pathways Are Distinct 
from Mechanosensory Pathways 
Pathways responsible for pain originate with other sen- 
sory neurons in dorsal root ganglia and, like other sensory 
nerve cells, the central axons of nociceptive nerve cells enter 
the spinal cord via the dorsal roots (Figure 10.3A). When 
these centrally projecting axons reach the dorsal horn of 
the spinal cord, they branch into ascending and descend- 
ing collaterals, forming the dorsolateral tract of Lissauer

(named after the German neurologist who first described 
this pathway in the late nineteenth century). Axons in Lis- 
sauer's tract typically run up and down for one or two spi- 
nal cord segments before they penetrate the gray matter 
of the dorsal horn. Once within the dorsal horn, the axons 
give off branches that contact second-order neurons lo- 
cated in Rexed's laminae 1, 2, and 5. (Rexed's laminae are 
the descriptive divisions of the spinal gray matter in cross 
section, named after the neuroanatomist who described 
these details in the 1950s; see Table Al and Figure A6 in 
the Appendix.) Laminae 1 and 5 contain projection neu- 
rons whose axons travel to brainstem and thalamic targets. 
Lamina 2 contains spinal cord interneurons. These afferent 
terminations are organized in a lamina-specific fashion; for 
example, C fibers terminate exclusively in Rexed's laminae 
1 and 2, while Ad fibers terminate in laminae 1 and 5. Non- 
nociceptive (Af) afferents terminate primarily in lamina 5, 
and a subset of the lamina 5 neurons receive converging in- 
puts from nociceptive and non-nociceptive afferents. These 
multimodal lamina 5 neurons are called wide-dynamic- 
range neurons. Some of them receive visceral sensory in- 
put as well, making them a likely substrate for referred pain 
(i.e., pain that arises from damage to visceral organs but is 
misperceived as coming from a somatic location). The most 
common clinical example is angina, in which poor perfu- 
sion of the heart muscle is misperceived as pain in the chest 
wall, the shoulder, and the left arm and hand (Box 10B). 
The axons of the second-order neurons in laminae 1 and 
5 of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord cross the midline and 
ascend to the brainstem and thalamus in the anterolateral 
(also called ventrolateral) quadrant of the contralateral half 
of the spinal cord (Figure 10.3B). For this reason, the neural 
pathway that conveys pain and temperature information 
to higher centers is often referred to as the anterolateral 
system, to distinguish it from the dorsal column—medial 
lemniscal system that conveys mechanosensory informa- 
tion (see Chapter 9). 
Axons conveying information for the anterolateral sys- 
tem and the dorsal column-—medial lemniscal system travel 
in different parts of the spinal cord white matter. This dif- 
ference provides a clinically relevant sign that is useful for 
FIGURE 10.3

in the dorsal horn. Second-order neurons in the dorsal horn

levels in the anterolateral column of the spinal cord. (B) C-fiber 
afferents terminate in Rexed's laminae 1 and 2 of the dorsal horn, 
while AS fibers terminate in layers 1 and 5. The axons of second- 
order neurons in laminae 1 and 5 cross the midline and ascend to 
higher centers.

tem enter the spinal cord, turn, and ascend in the ipsilateral 
dorsal columns all the way to the medulla, where they syn- 
apse on neurons in the dorsal column nuclei (Figure 10.4A). 
The axons of neurons in the dorsal column nuclei then cross 
the midline and ascend to the contralateral thalamus. In 
contrast, the crossing point for information conveyed by the 
anterolateral system lies within the spinal cord. First-order 
neurons contributing to the anterolateral system terminate 
in the dorsal horn, and second-order neurons in the dorsal 
horn send their axons across the midline and ascend on the

Nociceptive 
afferents 
Chapters 9 and 10 presented a frame- 
work for considering the central neural 
pathways that convey innocuous mecha- 
nosensory signals and painful signals 
from cutaneous and deep somatic 
sources. Considering just the signals 
derived from the body below the head, 
discriminative mechanosensory and 
proprioceptive information travels to the 
ventral posterior thalamus via the dorsal 
column-—medial lemniscal system (see 
Figure 9.6A), while nociceptive informa- 
tion travels to the same (and additional) 
thalamic relays via the anterolateral sys- 
tems (see Figure 10.3A). 
But how do painful signals that arise 
in the visceral organs of the pelvis, 
abdomen, and thorax enter the central 
nervous system and ultimately reach an 
individual's consciousness? The answer 
is, via a newly discovered component 
of the dorsal column—medial lemniscal 
pathway that conveys visceral nocicep- 
tion. Although Chapter 21 will present 
more information on the systems that 
receive and process visceral sensory 
information, at this juncture it is worth 
considering this component of the pain

pathways and the way in which a bet- 
ter understanding of this particular 
pathway has begun to impact clinical 
medicine. 
Primary visceral afferents from the 
pelvic and abdominal viscera enter the 
spinal cord and synapse on second- 
order neurons in the dorsal horn of the 
lumbar-sacral spinal cord. As discussed 
in Box 10B and Chapter 21, some of 
these second-order neurons are cells 
that give rise to the anterolateral sys- 
tems and contribute to referred visceral 
pain patterns. However, other neu- 
rons—perhaps primarily those that give 
rise to nociceptive signals—synapse 
upon neurons in the intermediate gray 
region of the spinal cord near the cen- 
tral canal. These neurons, in turn, send 
their axons not through the anterolat- 
eral white matter of the spinal cord (as 
might be expected for a pain pathway) 
but through the dorsal columns in a 
position very near the midline (see 
Figure A). Similarly, second-order neu- 
rons in the thoracic spinal cord that 
convey nociceptive signals from tho- 
racic viscera send their axons rostrally

the caudal medulla, where neurons give

This dorsal column visceral sen-

principal pathway by which painful 
sensations arising in the viscera are 
detected and discriminated. Several 
observations support this conclusion: 
(1) neurons in the ventral posterior lat- 
eral nucleus, nucleus gracilis, and near 
the central canal of the spinal cord all 
respond to noxious visceral stimula- 
tion; (2) responses of neurons in the 
ventral posterior lateral nucleus and

greatly reduced by spinal lesions of 
the dorsal columns (Figure B), but not 
by lesions of the anterolateral white

contralateral side of the cord (in the anterolateral column) 
to their targets in the thalamus and brainstem. 
Because of this anatomical difference in the site of de- 
cussation, a unilateral spinal cord lesion results in dorsal 
column—medial lemniscal symptoms (loss of sensation of 
touch, pressure, vibration, and proprioception) on the side 
of the body ipsilateral to the lesion, and anterolateral symp- 
toms (deficits of pain and temperature perception) on the 
contralateral side of the body (Figure 10.4B). The deficits 
are due to the interruption of fibers ascending from lower 
levels of the cord; for this reason they include all regions 
of the body (on either the contralateral or ipsilateral side) 
that are innervated by spinal cord segments that lie below 
the level of the lesion. This pattern of dissociated sensory 
loss (contralateral pain and temperature, ipsilateral touch 
and pressure) is a signature of spinal cord lesions and, to- 
gether with local dermatomal signs (see Box 9A), can be 
used to define the level of the lesion. (See Box 10C for an 
important exception to the functional dissociation of the 
dorsal column—medial lemniscal and anterolateral systems 
for visceral pain.) 
Parallel Pain Pathways 
Second-order fibers in the anterolateral system project to 
a number of different structures in the brainstem and fore- 
brain, making it clear that pain is processed by a diverse and 
distributed network of neurons. While the full significance 
of this complex pattern of connections remains unclear, 
these central destinations are likely to mediate different 
aspects of the sensory and behavioral response to a painful 
stimulus.

One component of this system mediates the sensory- 
discriminative aspects of pain: the location, intensity, and 
quality of the noxious stimulation. These aspects of pain 
are thought to depend on information relayed through the 
ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) to neurons in the 
primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (Figures 10.5 
and 10.6A). (The pathway for relay of information from 
the face to the ventral posterior medial nucleus, or VPM, is 
considered in the next section.) Although axons from the 
anterolateral system overlap those from the dorsal column 
system in the ventral posterior nuclei, these axons contact 
different classes of relay neurons, so that nociceptive infor- 
mation remains segregated up to the level of cortical cir- 
cuits. Consistent with mediating the discriminative aspects 
of pain, electrophysiological recordings from nociceptive 
neurons in $1 show that these neurons have small, local- 
ized receptive fields—properties commensurate with be- 
havioral measures of pain localization. 
Other parts of the system convey information about the 
affective-motivational aspects of pain: the unpleasant 
feeling, the fear and anxiety, and the autonomic activa- 
tion that accompany exposure to a noxious stimulus (the 
classic "fight-or-flight" reaction; see Chapter 21). Targets 
of these projections include several subdivisions of the re- 
ticular formation, the deep layers of the superior colliculus, 
the central gray, the hypothalamus, and the amygdala. In 
addition, a distinct set of thalamic nuclei that lie medial 
to the ventral posterior nucleus, which we group together 
here as the midline thalamic nuclei (see Figure 10.5), are 
thought to play an important role in transmitting nocicep- 
tive signals to both the anterior cingulate cortex and to the 
insula (the region of cortex that lies on the medial wall of

man patients, which show that cingulate neurons respond 
to noxious stimuli, support the role of the anterior cingulate 
cortex in the perception of pain. Moreover, patients who 
have undergone cingulotomies report an attenuation of the 
unpleasantness that accompanies pain. 
Evidence from functional imaging studies in humans 
supports the view that different brain regions mediate the 
sensory-—discriminative and affective—motivational aspects 
of pain. The presentation of a painful stimulus results in 
the activation of both primary somatosensory cortex and 
anterior cingulate cortex; however, by using hypnotic sug- 
gestion to selectively increase or decrease the unpleasant- 
ness of a painful stimulus, it has been possible to tease apart 
the neural response to changes in the intensity of a painful 
stimulus versus changes in its unpleasantness. Changes 
in intensity are accompanied by changes in the activity of 
neurons in somatosensory cortex, with little change in the 
activity of cingulate cortex, whereas changes in unpleasant- 
ness are highly correlated with changes in the activity of 
neurons in cingulate cortex. 
From this description, it should be evident that the full 
experience of pain involves the cooperative action of an ex- 
tensive network of forebrain regions whose properties we 
are only beginning to understand. Indeed, brain imaging 
studies frequently refer to the broad array of areas whose 
activity is associated with the experience of pain—includ- 
ing the somatosensory cortex, insular cortex, amyedala, and 
alleviate chronic pain, even though they severely 
impair contralateral mechanosensory perception. 
Pain and Temperature Pathways 
for the Face 
Information about noxious and thermal stimulation of 
the face originates from first-order neurons located in the 
trigeminal ganglion and from ganglia associated with cra- 
nial nerves VII, IX, and X (Figure 10.6B). After entering 
the pons, these small myelinated and unmyelinated tri- 
geminal fibers descend to the medulla, forming the spinal 
trigeminal tract (or spinal tract of cranial nerve V) and ter- 
minate in two subdivisions of the spinal trigeminal com- 
plex: the pars interpolaris and pars caudalis. Axons from 
the second-order neurons in these two trigeminal nuclei 
cross the midline and terminate in a variety of targets in 
the brainstem and thalamus. Like their counterparts in 
the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, these targets can be 
grouped into those that mediate the discriminative as- 
pects of pain and those that mediate the affective/motiva- 
tional aspects. The discriminative aspects of facial pain are 
thought to be mediated by projections to the contralateral 
ventral posterior medial nucleus (via the trigeminotha- 
lamic tract) and projections from the VPM to primary and 
secondary somatosensory cortex. Affective/motivational 
aspects are mediated by connections to various targets in 
the reticular formation and midbrain, as well as by the 
midline nuclei of the thalamus, which supply the cingulate 
and insular regions of cortex.

CHAPTER 10 
Other Modalities Mediated by the 
Anterolateral System 
While the anterolateral system plays a critical role in me- 
diating nociception, it is also responsible for transmitting a 
variety of other innocuous information to higher centers. 
For example, in the absence of the dorsal column system, 
the anterolateral system appears to be capable of mediating 
what is commonly called "nondiscriminative touch," a form 
of tactile sensitivity that lacks the fine spatial resolution that 
can be supplied only by the dorsal column system. Thus, 
following damage to the dorsal column—medial lemniscal 
system, a crude form of tactile sensation remains, one in 
which two-point discrimination thresholds are increased 
and the ability to identify objects by touch alone (stereo— 
gnosis) is markedly impaired. 
As already alluded to, the anterolateral system is respon- 
sible for mediating innocuous temperature sensation. The 
sensation of warmth and cold is thought to be subserved by 
separate sets of primary afferents: warm fibers that respond 
with increasing spike discharge rates to increases in tem- 
perature, and cold fibers that respond with increasing spike 
discharge to decreases in temperature. Neither of these af- 
ferents responds to mechanical stimulation, and they are 
distinct from afferents that respond to temperatures that 
are considered painful (noxious heat, above 43°C; or nox- 
ious cold, below -17°C). The recent identification of TRP 
channels with sensitivity to temperatures in the innocuous 
range—TRPV3 and TRPV4 that respond to warm tempera- 
tures and TRPM8 that responds to cold temperatures— 
raises the possibility of labeled lines for the transmission of 
warmth and cold, beginning at the level of transduction and 
continuing within central pathways. Consistent with this 
idea, the information supplied by innocuous warm and cold 
afferents is relayed to higher centers by distinct classes of 
secondary neurons that reside in lamina 1 of the spinal cord. 
Indeed, the emerging view of lamina 1 is that it consists 
of a number of distinct classes of modality-selective neu- 
rons that convey noxious and innocuous types of sensory 
information into the anterolateral system. These include in- 
dividual classes of neurons that are sensitive to a variety of 
stimuli: sharp (first) pain, burning (second) pain, innocuous 
warmth, innocuous cold, histamine (mediating the sense of 
"itch"), slow mechanical stimulation ("sensual touch"), and 
a class of inputs that innervates muscles and senses lactic 
acid and other metabolites that are released during muscle 
contraction. The latter could contribute to the "burn" or 
ache that can accompany strenuous exercise. 
Is lamina 1 merely an eclectic mixture of cells with dif- 
ferent properties, or might a unifying theme account for 
this diversity? It has been proposed that the lamina 1 sys- 
tem functions as the sensory input to a network that is re- 
sponsible for representing the physiological condition of 
the body—a modality that has been called interoception, 
to distinguish it from exteroception (touch and pressure) 
and proprioception. These inputs drive the homeostatic 
mechanisms that maintain an optimal internal state. Some 
of these mechanisms are automatic, and the changes neces- 
sary to maintain homeostasis can be mediated by reflexive 
adjustment of the autonomic nervous system (see Chapter 
21). For example, changes in temperature evoke autonomic 
reflexes (e.g., sweating or shivering) that counter a distur- 
bance to the body's optimal temperature. Homeostatic 
disturbances are sometimes too great to be mediated by 
autonomic reflexes alone and require behavioral adjust- 
ments (e.g., putting on or taking off a sweater) to restore 
balance. In this conception, the sensations associated with 
the activation of the lamina 1 system—whether pleasant or 
noxious—motivate the initiation of behaviors appropriate 
to maintaining the physiological homeostasis of the body. 
Sensitization 
Following a painful stimulus associated with tissue damage 
(e.g., cuts, scrapes, and bruises), stimuli in the area of the 
injury and the surrounding region that would ordinarily be 
perceived as slightly painful are perceived as significantly 
more so, a phenomenon referred to as hyperalgesia. A 
good example of hyperalgesia is the increased sensitivity to 
temperature that occurs after a sunburn. This effect is due 
to changes in neuronal sensitivity that occur at the level of 
peripheral receptors as well as their central targets. 
Peripheral sensitization results from the interaction of 
nociceptors with the "inflammatory soup" of substances re- 
leased when tissue is damaged. These substances arise from 
activated nociceptors or from non-neuronal cells that reside 
within, or migrate to, the injured area. Nociceptors release 
peptides and neurotransmitters such as substance P, calci- 
tonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and ATP, all of which 
further contribute to the inflammatory response (vasodila- 
tion, swelling, and the release of histamine from mast cells). 
The list of non-neuronal cells that contribute to this "in- 
flammatory soup" includes mast cells, platelets, basophils, 
macrophages, neutrophils, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, 
and fibroblasts. These cells are responsible for releasing 
extracellular protons, arachidonic acid and other lipid me- 
tabolites, bradykinin, histamine, serotonin, prostaglandins, 
nucleotides, nerve growth factor (NGF), and numerous 
cytokines, chief among them interleukin-18 and tumor ne- 
crosis factor a (TNF-a). Most of these substances interact 
directly with receptors or ion channels of nociceptive fibers, 
augmenting their response (Figure 10.7). For example, the 
responses of the TRPV1 receptor to heat can be potentiated 
by direct interaction of the channel with extracellular pro- 
tons or lipid metabolites. NGF and bradykinin also potenti- 
ate the activity of the TRPV1 receptors, but do so indirectly

through the actions of separate cell-surface receptors (TrkA 
and bradykinin receptors, respectively) and their associated 
intracellular signaling pathways. The prostaglandins are 
thought to contribute to peripheral sensitization by bind- 
ing to G-protein-coupled receptors that increase levels of 
cyclic AMP within nociceptors. Prostaglandins also reduce 
the threshold depolarization required for generating action 
potentials via phosphorylation of a specific class of TTX- 
resistant sodium channels that are expressed in nocicep- 
tors. Cytokines may also impact receptors, but their main 
contribution to hyperalgesia results from the potentiation 
of the inflammatory response via increased production of 
prostaglandins, NGF, bradykinin, and extracellular protons. 
The presumed purpose of the complex chemical signal- 
ing cascade arising from local damage is not only to pro- 
tect the injured area (as a result of the painful perceptions 
produced by ordinary stimuli close to the site of damage), 
but also to promote healing and guard against infection 
by means of local effects such as increased blood flow and 
the migration of white blood cells to the site. Identify-

mechanisms of action is a fertile area of exploration in 
the search for potential analgesics (compounds that re- 
duce pain's intensity). For example, so-called 
NSAIDs 
(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), which include 
aspirin and ibuprofen, act by inhibiting cyclooxygenase 
(COX), an enzyme important in the biosynthesis of pros- 
taglandins. Interfering with neurotrophin or cytokine 
signaling has become a major strategy for controlling 
inflammatory disease and the resulting pain. Blocking 
the action of TNF-a with a neutralizing antibody has 
been significantly effective in the treatment of autoim- 
mune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, leading 
to dramatic reduction in both tissue destruction and the 
accompanying hyperalgesia. Likewise, anti- NGF anti- 
bodies have been shown to prevent and to reverse the 
behavioral signs of hyperalgesia in animal models. 
Central sensitization refers to an immediate-onset, 
activity-dependent increase in the excitability of neurons 
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord following high levels 
of activity in the nociceptive afferents. As a result, activ- 
ity levels in nociceptive afferents that were subthreshold 
prior to the sensitizing event become sufficient to generate 
action potentials in dorsal horn neurons, contributing to 
an increase in pain sensitivity. Although central sensitiza- 
tion is triggered in dorsal horn neurons by activity in noci- 
ceptors, the effects generalize to other inputs that arise from 
low-threshold mechanoreceptors. Thus, stimuli that under 
normal conditions would be innocuous (such as brushing 
the surface of the skin) activate second-order neurons in the 
dorsal horn that receive nociceptive inputs, giving rise to a 
sensation of pain. The induction of pain by a normally in- 
nocuous stimulus is referred to as allodynia. This phenom- 
enon typically occurs immediately after the painful event and 
can outlast the pain of the original stimulus by several hours. 
Like its peripheral counterpart, 
a number of different 
mechanisms contribute to central sensitization. One form 
of central sensitization, called "windup," involves a pro- 
gressive increase in the discharge rate of dorsal horn neu- 
rons in response to repeated low-frequency activation of 
nociceptive afferents. A behavioral correlate of the windup 
phenomenon has been studied by examining the perceived 
intensity of pain in response to multiple presentations of a 
noxious stimulus. Although the intensity of the stimula- 
tion is constant, the perceived intensity increases with each

_ Following the amputation of an extrem- 
ity, nearly all patients have an illusion 
_ that the missing limb is still present. 
_ Although this illusion usually dimin- 
_ ishes over time, it persists in some 
| degree throughout the amputee's life 
and can often be reactivated by injury 
_ to the stump or other perturbations. 
_ Such phantom sensations are not 
limited to amputated limbs; phantom 
_ breasts following mastectomy, phan- 
- tom genitalia following castration, and 
| phantoms of the entire lower body 
| following spinal cord transection have 
all been reported. Phantoms are also 
- common after local nerve block for 
| surgery. During recovery from brachial 
plexus anesthesia, for example, it is not 
unusual for the patient to experience 
a phantom arm, perceived as whole 
and intact, but displaced from the real 
arm. When the real arm is viewed, the 
_ phantom appears to "jump into" the 
arm and may emerge and reenter inter- 
mittently as the anesthesia wears off. 
These sensory phantoms demonstrate 
that the central machinery for process- 
ing somatic sensory information is not 
idle in the absence of peripheral stimuli; 
apparently, the central sensory pro- 
cessing apparatus continues to operate 
independently of the periphery, giving 
rise to these bizarre sensations.

higher-order somatic sensory process- 
ing—were it not for the fact that a 
substantial number of amputees also 
develop phantom pain. This com- 
mon problem is usually described as 
a tingling or burning sensation in the 
missing part. Sometimes, however, the 
sensation becomes a more serious pain 
that patients find increasingly debilitat- 
ing. Phantom pain is, in fact, one of the 
more common causes of chronic pain 
syndromes and is extraordinarily diffi- 
cult to treat. Because of the widespread 
nature of central pain processing, abla- 
tion of the spinothalamic tract, portions 
of the thalamus, or even primary sen- 
sory cortex does not generally relieve 
the discomfort felt by these patients. 
Indeed, considerable functional reor- 
ganization of somatotopic maps in the 
primary somatosensory cortex occurs 
in amputees. This reorganization starts 
immediately after the amputation and 
tends to evolve for several years. One 
of the effects of this process is that neu- 
rons that have lost their original inputs 
(ie., from the removed limb) respond to 
tactile stimulation of other body parts. 
A surprising consequence is that stimu- 
lation of the face, for example, can be 
experienced as if the missing limb had 
been touched. 
Further evidence that the phenom- 
enon of phantom limb is the result of a 
central representation is the experience 
BOX 10D Phantom Limbs and Phantom Pain 
of children born without limbs. Such 
individuals have rich phantom sensa- 
tions, despite the fact that a limb never 
developed. This observation suggests 
that a full representation of the body 
exists independently of the peripheral 
elements that are mapped. Based on 
these results, Ronald Melzack proposed 
that the loss of a limb generates an 
internal mismatch between the brain's 
representation of the body and the 
pattern of peripheral tactile input that 
reaches the neocortex. The consequence 
would be an illusory sensation that the 
missing body part is still present and 
functional. With time, the brain may 
adapt to this loss and alter its intrinsic 
somatic representation to better accord 
with the new configuration of the 
body. This change could explain why 
the phantom sensation appears almost 
immediately after limb loss, but usually 
decreases in intensity over time.

stimulus presentation. Windup lasts only during the period 
of stimulation and arises from the summation of the slow 
synaptic potentials evoked in dorsal horn neurons by no- 
ciceptive inputs. The sustained depolarization of the dorsal 
horn neurons results in part from the activation of voltage- 
dependent L-type calcium channels, and in part from the 
removal of the Mg block of NMDA receptors. Removing the 
Mg block increases the sensitivity of the dorsal horn neuron 
to glutamate, the neurotransmitter in nociceptive afferents. 
Other forms of central sensitization that last longer 
than the period of sensory stimulation (e.g., allodynia) are 
thought to involve an LTP-like enhancement of postsynap- 
tic potentials much like that described for the hippocampus 
(see Chapter 8). These effects are dependent on NMDA 
receptor-mediated elevations of Ca?* in spinal cord neu- 
rons postsynaptic to nociceptors. Reduction in the level of 
GABAergic or glycinergic inhibition in spinal cord circuits 
is also thought to contribute to persistent pain syndromes 
by increasing the excitability of dorsal horn projection neu- 
rons. Microglia and astrocytes also contribute to the central 
sensitization process, especially when there is injury to the 
nerve. For example, cytokines released from microglia pro- 
mote the widespread transcription of the COX-2 enzyme 
and ensuing production of prostaglandins in dorsal horn 
neurons. As described for nociceptive afferents, increased 
levels of prostaglandins in CNS neurons augment neuronal 
excitability. Thus, the analgesic effects of drugs that inhibit 
COX-2 transcription are due to actions in both the periph- 
ery and within the dorsal horn. 
As injured tissue heals, the sensitization induced by pe- 
ripheral and central mechanisms typically declines and the 
threshold for pain returns to pre-injury levels. However, 
when the afferent fibers or central pathways themselves are 
damaged—a frequent complication in pathological condi- 
tions including diabetes, shingles, AIDS, multiple sclero- 
sis, and stroke—these processes can persist. The resulting 
condition is referred to as neuropathic pain: a chronic, 
intensely painful experience that is difficult to treat with 
conventional analgesic medications. (See Box 10D for a de- 
scription of neuropathic pain associated with amputation of 
an extremity.) Neuropathic pain can arise spontaneously 
(i.e., without any stimulus), or it can be produced by mild 
stimuli that are common to everyday experience, such as 
the gentle touch and pressure of clothing, or warm and 
cool temperatures. Patients often describe their experience 
as a constant burning sensation interrupted by episodes of 
shooting, stabbing, or electric shocklike jolts. Because the 
disability and psychological stress associated with chronic 
neuropathic pain can be severe, much present research is 
being devoted to better understanding of the mechanisms 
of peripheral and central sensitization with the hope of 
developing more effective therapies for this debilitating 
syndrome.

223 
Descending Control of 
Pain Perception 
With respect to the interpretation of pain, observers have 
long commented on the difference between the objective 
reality of a painful stimulus and the subjective response to 
it. Modern studies of this discrepancy have provided con- 
siderable insight into how circumstances affect pain percep- 
tion and, ultimately, into the anatomy and pharmacology 
of the pain system. 
During World War II, Henry Beecher and his colleagues 
at Harvard Medical School made a fundamental observa- 
tion. In the first systematic study of its kind, they found 
that soldiers suffering from severe battle wounds often ex- 
perienced little or no pain. Indeed, many of the wounded 
expressed surprise at this odd dissociation. Beecher, an 
anesthesiologist, concluded that the perception of pain de- 
pends on its context. For instance, the pain of an injured 
soldier on the battlefield would presumably be mitigated 
by the imagined benefits of being removed from danger, 
whereas a similar injury in a domestic setting would present 
quite a different set of circumstances that could exacerbate 
the pain (loss of work, financial liability, and so on). Such 
observations, together with the well-known placebo effect 
(discussed in the next section), make clear that the per- 
ception of pain is subject to central modulation; indeed, all 
sensations are subject to at least some degree of this kind 
of modification. This statement should not be taken as a 
vague acknowledgment about the importance of psycho- 
logical or "top-down" influences on sensory experience. On 
the contrary, there has been a gradual realization among 
neuroscientists and neurologists that such "psychologi- 
cal" effects are as real and important as any other neural 
phenomenon. This appreciation has provided a much more 
rational view of psychosomatic problems in general, and 
pain in particular. 
The Placebo Effect 
The word placebo means "I will please," and the placebo 
effect is defined as a physiological response following the 
administration of a pharmacologically inert "remedy." 
The placebo effect has a long history of use (and abuse) in 
medicine, but its reality is undisputed. In one classic study, 
medical students were givenvone of two different pills, one 
said to be a sedative and the other a stimulant. In fact, both 
pills contained only inert ingredients. Of the students who 
received the "sedative," more than two-thirds reported 
feeling drowsy, and students who took two such pills felt 
sleepier than those who took only one. Conversely, a large 
fraction of the students who took the "stimulant" reported 
that they felt less tired. Moreover, about one-third of the 
entire group reported side effects ranging from headaches 

224 
CHAPTER 10 
and dizziness to tingling extremities and a staggering gait! 
Only 3 of the 56 students in the group reported that the pills 
they took had no appreciable effect. 
In another study of this general sort, 75% of patients suf- 
fering from postoperative wound pain reported satisfactory 
relief after an injection of sterile saline. The researchers who 
carried out this work noted that the responders were indis- 
tinguishable from the non-responders, both in the apparent 
severity of their pain and in their psychological makeup. 
Most tellingly, this placebo effect in postoperative patients 
could be blocked by naloxone, a competitive antagonist of 
opioid receptors, indicating that there is a substantial physi- 
ological basis for the pain relief experienced (see the next 
section). In addition, imaging studies show that the admin- 
istration of a placebo with the expectation that it represents 
an analgesic agent is associated with activation of endoge- 
neous opioid receptors in cortical and subcortical brain re- 
gions that are part of the pain matrix, including the anterior 
cingulate and insular regions of cortex and the amygdala. 
A common misunderstanding about the placebo effect 
is the view that patients who respond to a therapeutically 
meaningless reagent are not suffering real pain, but only 
"imagining" it. This certainly is not the case. Among other 
things, the placebo effect probably explains the efficacy of 
acupuncture anesthesia and the analgesia that can some- 
times be achieved by hypnosis. In China, surgery is often 
carried out under the effect of a needle (often carrying a 
small electrical current) inserted at locations dictated by 
ancient acupuncture charts. Before the advent of modern 
anesthetic techniques, operations such as thyroidectomies 
for goiter were commonly done without extraordinary dis- 
comfort, particularly among populations where stoicism 
was the cultural norm. 
The mechanisms of pain amelioration on the battlefield, 
in acupuncture anesthesia, and with hypnosis are presum- 
ably related. Although the mechanisms by which the brain 
affects the perception of pain are only beginning to be un- 
derstood, the effect is neither magical nor a sign of a sug- 
gestible intellect. In short, the placebo effect is quite real. 
The Physiological Basis of 
Pain Modulation 
Understanding the central modulation of pain perception 
(on which the placebo effect is presumably based) was 
greatly advanced by the finding that electrical or pharma- 
cological stimulation of certain regions of the midbrain pro- 
duces relief of pain. This analgesic effect arises from activa- 
tion of descending pain-modulating pathways that project 
to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (as well as to the spi- 
nal trigeminal nucleus) and regulate the transmission of 
information to higher centers. One of the major brainstem 
regions that produce this effect is located in the periaque- 
ductal gray matter of the midbrain. Electrical stimulation at 
this site in experimental animals not only produces anal- 
gesia by behavioral criteria, but also demonstrably inhibits 
the activity of nociceptive projection neurons in the dorsal 
horn of the spinal cord. 
Further studies of descending pathways to the spinal 
cord that regulate the transmission of nociceptive informa- 
tion have shown that they arise from a number of brainstem 
sites, including the parabrachial nucleus, the dorsal raphe, 
and locus coeruleus and the medullary reticular formation 
(Figure 10.8A). The analgesic effects of stimulating the peri- 
aqueductal gray are mediated through these brainstem sites. 
These centers employ a wealth of different neurotransmit- 
ters (e.g., noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine, histamine, 
acetylcholine) and can exert both facilitatory and inhibitory 
effects on the activity of neurons in the dorsal horn. The 
complexity of these interactions is made even greater by 
the fact that descending projections can exert their effects 
on a variety of sites within the dorsal horn, including the 
synaptic terminals of nociceptive afferents, excitatory and 
inhibitory interneurons, and the synaptic terminals of the 
other descending pathways, as well as by contacting the 
projection neurons themselves. Although these descend- 
ing projections were originally viewed as a mechanism that 
served primarily to inhibit the transmission of nociceptive 
signals, it is now evident that these projections provide a 
balance of facilitatory and inhibitory influences that ulti- 
mately determines the efficacy of nociceptive transmission. 
In addition to descending projections, local interactions 
between mechanoreceptive afferents and neural circuits 
within the dorsal horn can modulate the transmission of 
nociceptive information to higher centers (Figure 10.8B). 
These interactions are thought to explain the ability to re- 
duce the sensation of sharp pain by activating low-thresh- 
old mechanoreceptors—for example, if you crack your shin 
or stub a toe, a natural (and effective) reaction is to vigor- 
ously rub the site of injury for a minute or two. Such obser- 
vations, buttressed by experiments in animals, led Ronald 
Melzack and Patrick Wall to propose that the flow of noci- 
ceptive information through the spinal cord is modulated 
by concomitant activation of the large myelinated fibers 
associated with low-threshold mechanoreceptors. Even 
though further investigation led to modification of some of 
the original propositions in Melzack and Wall's gate theory 
of pain, the idea stimulated a great deal of work on pain 
modulation and has emphasized the importance of synap- 
tic interactions within the dorsal horn for modulating the 
perception of pain intensity. 
The most exciting advance in this longstanding effort to 
understand central mechanisms of pain regulation has been 
the discovery of endogenous opioids. For centuries, opium 
derivatives such as morphine have been known to be pow- 
erful analgesics—indeed, they remain a mainstay of anal- 
gesic therapy today. In the modern era, animal studies have 
shown that a variety of brain regions are susceptible to the

systems originate in the somatic sensory cortex, the hypothala-

modulatory effects occur at each of these sites, as well as in the 
dorsal horn. (B) Gate theory of pain. Activation of mechanore-

action of opioid drugs, particularly—and significantly—the 
periaqueductal gray matter and other sources of descending 
projections. There are, in addition, opioid-sensitive neurons 
within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In other words, 
the areas that produce analgesia when stimulated are also 
responsive to exogenously administered opioids. It seems 
likely, then, that opioid drugs act at most or all of the sites 
shown in Figure 10.8 in producing their dramatic pain- 
relieving effects. 
The analgesic action of opioids led researchers to suspect 
the existence of specific brain and spinal cord receptors for 
these drugs long before the 1960s and 1970s, when such 
receptors were actually identified. Since these receptors 
are unlikely to have evolved in response to the exogenous 
administration of opium and its derivatives, the convic- 
tion grew that endogenous opioid-like compounds must 
exist in order to explain the evolution of opioid receptors 
(see Chapter 6). Several categories of endogenous opioids 
have been isolated from the brain and intensively studied.

These agents are found in the same regions involved in the 
modulation of nociceptive afferents, although each of the 
families of endogenous opioid peptides has a somewhat 
different distribution. All three of the major groups—en- 
kephalins, endorphins, and dynorphins (see Table 6.2)— 
are present in the periaqueductal gray matter. Enkephalins 
and dynorphins have also been found in the rostral ventral 
medulla and in those spinal cord regions involved in pain 
modulation. 
One of the most compelling examples of the mechanism 
by which endogenous opioids modulate transmission of 
nociceptive information occurs at the first synapse in the 
pain pathway between nociceptive afferents and projection 
neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (see Figure 
10.8B). A class of enkephalin-containing local circuit neu- 
rons within the dorsal horn synapses with the axon termi- 
nals of nociceptive afferents, which in turn synapse with 
dorsal horn projection neurons. The release of enkepha- 
lin onto the nociceptive terminals inhibits their release of 

226 
CHAPTER 10 
neurotransmitter onto the projection neuron, thus reduc- 
ing the level of activity that is passed on to higher centers. 
Enkephalin-containing local circuit neurons are themselves 
the targets of descending projections, providing a powerful 
mechanism by which higher centers can decrease the activ- 
ity relayed by nociceptive afferents. 
_ 
In a similar fashion, the analgesic effects of marijuana 
(Cannabis) led to the discovery of endocannabinoids. Ex- 
ogenously administered cannabinoids are known to sup- 
press nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn of the spi- 
nal cord without altering the activity of non-nociceptive 
neurons. We now know that endogenous cannabinoids in 
the CNS act as neurotransmitters; they are released from 
depolarized neurons and travel to presynaptic terminals, 
where they activate cannabinoid receptors (CB,) through a 
retrograde signaling mechanism. The actions of endocan- 
nabinoids are thought to decrease the release of neurotrans- 
mitters such as GABA and glutamate, thus modulating 
neuronal excitability. Evidence for a direct effect of endo- 
cannabinoids on the transmission of nociceptive signals 
comes from studies showing that analgesic effects induced 
by electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray can be 
blocked if CB, antagonists are administered. In addition, it 
appears that exposure to noxious stimuli increases the level 
of endocannabinoids in the periaqueductal gray matter, a 
finding that supports a major role for these molecules in the 
descending control of pain transmission. 
The story of endogenous anti-nociceptive compounds 
is impressive in its wedding of physiology, pharmacology, 
and clinical research to yield a richer understanding of the 
intrinsic modulation of pain. This information has finally 
begun to explain the subjective variability of painful stimuli 
and the striking dependence of pain perception on the con- 
text of experience. Many laboratories are exploring the pre- 
cise mechanisms by which pain is modulated, motivated by 
the tremendous clinical (and economic) benefits that would 
accrue from a deeper understanding of the pain system and 
its molecular underpinnings. 
Summary 
Whether studied from a structural or from a functional per- 
spective, pain is an extraordinarily complex sensory mo- 
dality. Because pain is an important means of warning an 
animal of dangerous circumstances, the mechanisms and 
pathways that subserve nociception are widespread and 
redundant. A distinct set of pain afferents with membrane 
receptors known as nociceptors transduce noxious stimula- 
tion and convey this information to neurons in the dorsal 
horn of the spinal cord. The major central pathway respon- 
sible for transmitting the discriminative aspects of pain (lo- 
cation, intensity, and quality) differs from the mechanosen- 
sory pathway primarily in that the central axons of dorsal 
root ganglion cells synapse on second-order neurons in the 
dorsal horn; the axons of the second-order neurons then 
cross the midline in the spinal cord and ascend to thalamic 
nuclei that relay information to the somatic sensory cortex 
of the postcentral gyrus. Additional pathways involving a 
number of centers in the brainstem, thalamus, and cortex 
mediate the affective and motivational responses to painful 
stimuli. Descending pathways interact with local circuits in 
the spinal cord to regulate the transmission of nociceptive 
signals to higher centers. Researchers have made tremen- 
dous progress in understanding pain in the last 25 years, 
and much more seems likely, given the importance of the 
problem. No patients are more distressed—or more dif- 
ficult to treat—than those with chronic pain, a devastating 
by-product of the protective function of this vital sensory 
modality.

Overview 
THE HUMAN VISUAL SYSTEM IS EXTRAORDINARY in the quantity and quality 
of information it supplies about the world. A glance is sufficient to describe the loca- 
tion, size, shape, color, and texture of objects and, if the objects are moving, their 
direction and speed. Equally remarkable is the fact that viewers can discern visual 
information over a wide range of stimulus intensities, from the faint light of stars at 
night to bright sunlight. The next two chapters describe the molecular, cellular, and 
higher order mechanisms that allow us to see. The first steps in the process of seeing 
involve transmission and refraction of light by the optics of the eye, the transduction 
of light energy into electrical signals by photoreceptors, and the refinement of these 
signals by synaptic interactions within the neural circuits of the retina. 
Anatomy of the Eye 
The eye is a fluid-filled sphere enclosed by three layers of tissue (Figure 11.1). Only 
the innermost layer of the eye, the retina, contains neurons that are sensitive to light 
and are capable of transmitting visual signals to central targets. The immediately 
adjacent layer of tissue includes three distinct but continuous structures collectively 
referred to as the uveal tract. The largest component of the uveal tract is the choroid, 
which is composed of a rich capillary bed (important for nourishing the photorecep- 
tors of the retina) as well as a high concentration of the light-absorbing pigment 
melanin. Extending from the choroid near the front of the eye is the ciliary body, a 
ring of tissue that encircles the lens and consists of two parts: a muscular component 
that is important for adjusting the refractive power of the lens, and a vascular compo- 
nent (the so-called ciliary processes) that produces the fluid that fills the front of the 
eye. The most anterior component of the uveal tract is the iris, the colored portion 
of the eye that can be seen through the cornea. It contains two sets of muscles with 
opposing actions, which allow the size of the pupil (the opening in its center) to be 
adjusted under neural control. The sclera forms the outermost tissue layer of the eye 
and is composed of a tough, white, fibrous tissue. At the front of the eye, however, 
this opaque outer layer is transformed into the cornea, a specialized transparent tis- 
sue that permits light rays to enter the eye. 
VISION: [THE EYE 

230 
CHAPTER 11 
Beyond the cornea, light rays pass through two distinct 
fluid environments before striking the retina. In the ante- 
rior chamber, just behind the cornea and in front of the 
lens, lies aqueous humor, a clear, watery liquid that sup- 
plies nutrients to both of these structures. Aqueous humor 
is produced by the ciliary processes in the posterior cham- 
ber (the region between the lens and the iris) and flows 
into the anterior chamber through the pupil. The amount of 
fluid produced by the ciliary processes is substantial, it is es- 
timated that the entire volume of fluid in the anterior cham- 
ber is replaced 12 times a day. Thus, the rate of aqueous 
humor production must be balanced by comparable rate 
of drainage from the anterior chamber in order to ensure a 
constant intraocular pressure. A specialized meshwork of 
cells lying at the junction of the iris and the cornea is re- 
sponsible for aqueous drainage. Failure of adequate drain- 
age results in a disorder known as glaucoma, in which high 
levels of intraocular pressure can reduce the blood supply to 
the eye and eventually damage retinal neurons. 
The space between the back of the lens and the sur- 
face of the retina is filled with a thick, gelatinous substance 
called the vitreous humor, which accounts for about 80% 
of the volume of the eye. In addition to maintaining the 
shape of the eye, the vitreous humor contains phagocytic 
cells that remove blood and other debris that might other- 
wise interfere with light transmission. The housekeeping 
abilities of the vitreous humor are limited, however, as a 
large number of middle-aged and elderly individuals with 
vitreal "floaters" will attest. Floaters are collections of debris 
too large for phagocytic consumption that therefore remain 
to cast annoying shadows on the retina; they typically arise 
when the aging vitreous membrane pulls away from the 
overly long eyeball of myopic individuals (Box 11A). 
The Formation of Images 
on the Retina 
Normal vision requires that the optical media of the eye be 
transparent, and both the cornea and the lens are remarkable 
examples of tissue specialization, achieving a level of trans- 
parency that rivals that found in inorganic materials such as 
glass. Not surprisingly, alterations in the composition of the 
comea or the lens can significantly reduce their transparency 
and have serious consequences for visual perception. Indeed, 
opacities in the lens known as cataracts account for roughly 
half the cases of blindness in the world, and almost every- 
one over the age of 70 will experience some loss of transpar- 
ency in the lens that ultimately degrades the quality of visual 
experience. Fortunately, successful surgical treatments for 
cataracts can restore vision in most cases. Furthermore, the 
recognition that a major factor in the production of cataracts 
is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation has heightened 
public awareness of the need to protect the lens (and the ret- 
ina) by reducing UV exposure through the use of sunglasses.

Beyond efficiently transmitting light energy, the primary 
function of the optical components of the eye is to achieve a 
focused image on the surface of the retina. The cornea and 
lens are primarily responsible for the refraction (bending) 
of light necessary for the formation of focused images on 
the photoreceptors of the retina (Figure 11.2). The cornea 
contributes most of the necessary refraction, as can be ap- 
preciated by considering the hazy, out-of-focus images

focusing on near objects involves the contraction of the ciliary 
muscle, which reduces tension in the zonule fibers and allows 
the elasticity of the lens to increase its curvature (yellow arrows). 

VISION: THE EYE 
231 
BOX 11A Myopia and Other Refractive Errors 
_ Discrepancies of the various physical 
_ components of the eye cause a majority 
of the human population to have some 
form of refractive error, called ametro- 
_ pia. People who are unable to bring 
distant objects into clear focus are said 
to be nearsighted, or myopic (Figure 
_ B). Myopia can be caused by a corneal 
surface that is too curved or by an eye- 
ball that is too long. In either case, with 
the lens as flat as it can be, the image of 
distant objects focuses in front of, rather 
than on, the retina. 
People who are unable to focus on 
near objects are said to be farsighted, or 
hyperopic. An eyeball that is too short 
or a refracting system that is too weak 
can cause hyperopia (Figure C). Even 
with the lens in its most rounded-up 
state, the image is out of focus on the 
retinal surface (focusing at some point 
behind it). Both myopia and hyperopia 
are correctable by appropriate lenses— 
- concave (minus) and convex (plus), 
respectively—or by the increasingly 
popular technique of corneal surgery. 
Myopia is by far the most common 
ametropia; it affects an estimated 50% 
of the United States population. Given 
the large number of people who need 
glasses, contact lenses, or surgery to cor- 
rect this refractive error, one naturally 
wonders how nearsighted people coped 
before spectacles were invented only a 
few centuries ago. From what is now 
known about myopia, most people's 
vision may have been considerably bet- 
ter in ancient times. The basis for this 
assertion is the surprising finding that 
the growth of the eyeball is strongly 
influenced by focused light falling on 
the retina. This phenomenon was first 
described in 1977 by Torsten Wiesel and 
Elio Raviola at Harvard Medical School, 
who studied monkeys reared with their 
lids sutured (the same approach used to 
demonstrate the effects of visual depri- 
vation on cortical connections in the 
visual system; see Chapter 24), a pro- 
cedure that deprives the eye of focused 
retinal images. They found that animals 
erowing to maturity under these condi- 
tions show an elongation of the eyeball. 
The effect of focused light deprivation 
appears to be a local one, since the 
abnormal growth of the eye occurs in 
experimental animals even if the optic 
nerve is cut. Indeed, if only a portion of 
the retinal surface is deprived of focused 
light, then only that region of the eyeball 
grows abnormally. 
Although the mechanism of light- 
mediated control of eye growth is not 
fully understood, many experts now 
believe that the modern prevalence of 
myopia may be due to some aspect of 
modern civilization—perhaps learning 
to read and write at an early age—that 
interferes with the normal feedback 
control of vision on eye development, 
leading to abnormal elongation of the 
eyeball. A corollary of this hypothesis 
is that if children (or, more likely, their 
parents) wanted to improve their vision, 
they might be able to do so by practicing 
far vision to counterbalance the near- 
work "overload." Practically, of course, 
most people would probably choose 
wearing glasses or contacts or having 
corneal surgery rather than indulging 
in the onerous daily practice that would 
presumably be required. Furthermore, 
not everyone agrees that such a remedy 
would be effective, and a number of 
investigators (and drug companies) are 
exploring the possibility of pharmaco- 
logical intervention during the period of 
childhood when abnormal eye growth 
is presumed to occur. In any event, it 
is a remarkable fact that deprivation of 
focused light on the retina causes a com- 
pensatory growth of the eye and that 
this feedback loop is so easily perturbed. 
Even people with normal (emme- 
tropic) vision as young adults eventual- 
ly experience difficulty focusing on near 
objects. One of the many consequences 
of aging is that the lens loses its elastic- 
ity; as a result, the maximum curvature 
the lens can achieve when the ciliary 
muscle contracts is gradually reduced. 
The near point (the closest point that 
can be brought into clear focus) thus 
recedes, and objects (such as this 
book) must be held farther and farther 
away from the eye in order to focus 
them on the retina. At some point, 
usually during early middle age, the

accommodative ability of the eye is so 
reduced that near-vision tasks such as 
reading become difficult or impossible 
(Figure D). This condition is referred to 
as presbyopia. Presybyopia can be cor- 
rected by convex lenses for near-vision 
tasks, or by bifocal lenses if myopia (a 
circumstance that requires a negative 
correction) is also present. 
Bifocal correction presents a par- 
ticular problem for those who prefer 
contact lenses. Because contact lenses 
float on the surface of the cornea, hav- 
ing the distance correction on the upper 
part of the lens and the near correc- 
tion on the lower part of the lens (as 
in conventional bifocal glasses) doesn't 
work (although "omnifocal" contact 
lenses have recently been used with 
some success). A surprisingly effec- 
tive solution to this problem for some 
contact lens wearers has been to put a 
near-correcting lens in one eye and a

experienced when swimming underwater. Water, unlike air, 
has a refractive index close to that of the cornea; as a result, 
immersion in water virtually eliminates the refraction that 
normally occurs at the air/cornea interface; thus, the image 
is no longer focused on the retina. The lens has considerably 
less refractive power than the cornea; however, the refraction 
supplied by the lens is adjustable, allowing the observer to 
bring objects at various distances into sharp focus. 
Dynamic changes in the refractive power of the lens are 
referred to as accommodation. When viewing distant ob- 
jects, the lens is made relatively thin and flat and has the least 
refractive power. For near vision, the lens becomes thicker 
and rounder and has the most refractive power (see Figure 
11.2). These changes result from the activity of the ciliary 
muscle that surrounds the lens. The lens is held in place 
by radially arranged connective tissue bands called zonule 
fibers that are attached to the ciliary muscle. The shape 
of the lens is thus determined by two opposing forces: the 
elasticity of the lens, which tends to keep it rounded up (re- 
moved from the eye, the lens becomes spheroidal); and the 
tension exerted by the zonule fibers, which tends to flatten 
it. When viewing distant objects, the force from the zonule 
fibers is greater than the elasticity of the lens, and the lens 
assumes the flatter shape appropriate for distance viewing. 
Focusing on closer objects requires relaxing the tension in

the zonule fibers, allowing the inherent elasticity of the lens 
to increase its curvature. This relaxation is accomplished by 
the sphincter-like contraction of the ciliary muscle. Because 
the ciliary muscle forms a ring around the lens, when the 
muscle contracts, the attachment points of the zonule fibers 
move toward the central axis of the eye, thus reducing the 
tension on the lens. Unfortunately, changes in the shape of 
the lens are not always able to produce a focused image on 
the retina, in which case a sharp image can be focused only 
with the help of additional corrective lenses (see Box 11A). 
Adjustments in the size of the pupil also contribute to 
the clarity of images formed on the retina. Like the images 
formed by other optical instruments, those generated by 
the eye are affected by spherical and chromatic aberrations, 
which tend to blur the retinal image. Since these aberrations 
are greatest for light rays that pass farthest from the center 
of the lens, narrowing the pupil reduces both spherical and 
chromatic aberration, just as closing the iris diaphragm on a 
camera lens improves the sharpness of a photographic im- 
age. Reducing the size of the pupil also increases the depth 
of field—that is, the distance within which objects are seen 
without blurring. However, a small pupil also limits the 
amount of light that reaches the retina, and, under condi- 
tions of dim illumination, visual acuity becomes limited 
by the number of available photons rather than by optical

aberrations. An adjustable pupil thus provides an effective 
means of reducing optical aberrations, while maximizing 
depth of field to the extent that different levels of illumina- 
tion permit. The size of the pupil is controlled by innervation 
from both sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the 
visceral motor system, which in turn are modulated by sev- 
eral brainstem centers (see Chapters 20 and 21). 
The Surface of the Retina 
Using an ophthalmoscope, the inner surface of the retina, or 
fundus, can be visualized through the pupil (Figure 11.3). 
Numerous blood vessels, both arteries and veins, fan out over 
the inner surface of the retina. These blood vessels arise from 
the ophthalmic artery and vein, which enter the eye through 
a whitish circular area known as the optic disk, or optic pa- 
pilla. The optic disk is also the site where retinal axons leave 
the eye and travel through the optic nerve to reach target 
structures in the thalamus and midbrain. This region of the 
retina contains no photoreceptors and, because it is insensi- 
tive to light, produces the perceptual phenomena known as 
the blind spot (Box 11B). In addition to being a conspicuous 
retinal landmark, the appearance of the optic disk is a use- 
ful gauge of intracranial pressure. The subarachnoid space 
surrounding the optic nerve is continuous with that of the 
brain; as a result, increases in intracranial pressure—a sign 
of serious neurological problems such as space-occupying 
lesions—can be detected as a swelling of the optic disk. 
Another prominent feature of the fundus is the macula 
lutea, an oval spot containing yellow pigment (xantho- 
phyll), roughly 3 millimeters in diameter and located near 
the center of the retina. The macula is the region of the 
retina that supports high visual acuity (the ability to resolve 
fine details). Acuity is greatest at the center of the macula, 
a small depression or pit in the retina called the fovea. The 
pigment xanthophyll has a protective role, filtering ultra- 
violet wavelengths that could be harmful to the photore- 
ceptors. Damage to this region of the retina, as occurs in 
age-related macular degeneration, has a devastating impact 
on visual perception (Box 11C).

ganglion cell axons leave the retina to form the optic nerve; it is 
also characterized by the entrance and exit, respectively, of the 
ophthalmic arteries and veins that supply the retina. The macula 
lutea can be seen at the center of the optical axis (the optic disk 
lies nasally); the macula is the region of the retina that has the 
highest visual acuity. The fovea is a depression, or pit, about 1.5 
mm in diameter that lies at the center of the macula. 
Retinal Circuitry 
Despite its peripheral location, the retina, which is the neu- 
ral portion of the eye, is actually part of the central ner- 
vous system. During development, the retina forms as an 
outpocketing of the diencephalon called the optic vesicle. 
The optic vesicle undergoes invagination to form the optic 
cup (Figure 11.4; see also Chapter 22). The inner wall of 
the optic cup gives rise to the retina, while the outer wall 
gives rise to the retinal pigment epithelium. This epithe- 
lium is a thin, melanin-containing structure that reduces

CHAPTER 11 
BOX 11B The Blind Spot 
- It is logical to suppose that a visual field 
_ defect, or scotoma, would be obvious 
_ to any individual suffering from such 
_ pathology. When the deficit involves 
a peripheral region of the visual field, 
however, a scotoma often goes unno- 
| ticed until a car accident or other mis- 
_ hap dramatically reveals the sensory 
_ loss. In fact, all of us have a physiologi- 
| cal scotoma—the "blind spot," a gap in 
~ each monocular visual field that corre- 
_ sponds to the location of the optic disk 
' (the receptor-free region of the retina 
_ where the optic nerve leaves the eye; 
see Figure 11.1). 
To find the "blind spot" of your right 
eye, hold this book about a foot away 
_ from your face, close your left eye, and 
fixate on the X in the box drawn below. 
_ Take a pencil in your right hand and, 
_ without breaking fixation, move the 
tip slowly toward the X from the right 
_ side of the page. At some point, the tip 
(indeed, the whole end) of the pencil 
will disappear. Mark that point and 
» continue to move the pencil to the left 
until it reappears, then make another 
mark. You can determine the borders of 
the blind spot along the vertical axis in 
the same way by moving the pencil up 
and down along the plane of the page 
so that its path falls between the two 
horizontal marks. To prove that infor- 
mation from the visual space bounded 
by the marks is not perceived, put a 
penny inside the demarcated area. 
When you fixate the X with both eyes 
and close the left eye, the penny will 
disappear. 
How can we be unaware of such 
a large (typically 5°-8°) defect in the 
visual field? The optic disk is located 
in the nasal retina of each eye. With 
both eyes open, information about the 
corresponding region of visual space is 
available from the temporal retina of 
the other eye. But this does not explain 
why the blind spot remains undetected 
with one eye closed. When the world is 
viewed monocularly, the visual system 
appears to "fill in" the missing part of 
the scene based on the information 
supplied by the regions surrounding 
the optic disk. To observe this phe- 
nomenon, notice what happens when 
the pencil lies across the optic disk 
representation—remarkably, it looks 
complete! Although electrophysiologi- 
cal recordings have shown that neurons 
in the visual cortex whose receptive 
fields lie in the optic disk representa- 
tion can be activated by stimulating the 
regions surrounding the optic disk of 
the contralateral eye—which suggests 
that filling in the blind spot is based 
on cortical mechanisms that integrate 
information from different points in 
the visual field—the mechanism of 
this phenomenon is not clear. Herman 
von Helmholtz pointed out in the 
nineteenth century that it may be that 
this part of the visual world is simply 
ignored, and the pencil is completed 
across the blind spot because the rest of 
— 
the scene "collapses" around it.

backscattering of the light that enters the eye and, as will 
become apparent, plays a critical role in maintaining the 
phototransduction machinery of retinal photoreceptors. 
Consistent with its status as a full-fledged part of the 
central nervous system, the retina exhibits complex neural 
circuitry that converts the graded electrical activity of spe- 
cialized photosensitive neurons—the photoreceptors—into 
action potentials that travel to central targets via axons in 
the optic nerve. Although it has the same types of functional 
elements and neurotransmitters found in other parts of the 
central nervous system, the retina comprises fewer broad 
classes of neurons, and these are arranged in a manner that 
has been less difficult to unravel than the circuits in other 
areas of the brain. 
There are five basic classes of neurons in the retina: pho- 
toreceptors, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, 
and amacrine cells. The cell bodies and processes of these 
neurons are stacked in alternating layers, with the cell bodies

Macular Degeneration 
_ An estimated 6 million people in the 
_ United States suffer from a condition 
_ known as age-related macular degen- 
eration (AMD), which causes a progres- 
_ 
sive loss of central vision. Because cen- 
_ 
tral vision is critical for sight, diseases 
that affect the macula (see Figure 11.1) 
severely limit a person's ability to per- 
_ form visual tasks. Indeed, in the United 
States, AMD is the most common cause 
of vision loss in people over age 55, and 
its incidence is rising as the population 
ages. 
The underlying problem, which 
remains poorly understood, is degen- 
eration of the photoreceptors. Usually, 
patients first notice a blurring of central 
vision when performing tasks such as 
reading. Images may also appear dis- 
torted. A chart known as the Amsler 
grid is used as a simple test for early 
signs of AMD. By focusing on a marked 
spot in the middle of the grid (which 
resembles a piece of graph paper), the 
patient can assess whether the paral- 
lel and perpendicular lines on the grid 
appear blurred or distorted. Blurred 
central vision often progresses to hav- 
ing blind spots within central vision, 
and in most cases both eyes are eventu- 
ally involved. 
Although the risk of developing 
AMD clearly increases with age, the 
causes of the disease are not known. 
Various studies have implicated heredi- 
tary factors, cardiovascular disease, 
environmental factors such as smok- 
ing and light exposure, and nutritional 
causes. Indeed, it may be that all these 
contribute to the risk of developing 
AMD. 
In descriptive terms, macular degen- 
eration is broadly divided into two 
types. In the exudative—neovascular form, 
or "wet" AMD, which accounts for 
10% of all cases, abnormal blood vessel 
growth occurs under the macula. These 
blood vessels leak fluid and blood into 
the retina and cause damage to the 
photoreceptors. Wet AMD tends to 
_ progress rapidly and can cause severe 
damage; rapid loss of central vision 
may occur over just a few months. The 
treatment for this form of the disease is 
laser therapy. By transferring thermal 
energy, the laser beam destroys the 
leaky blood vessels under the macula, 
thus slowing the rate of vision loss. A 
disadvantage of this approach is that 
the high thermal energy delivered by 
the beam also destroys nearby healthy 
tissue. An improvement in the laser 
treatment of AMD involves a light- 
activated drug to target abnormal blood 
vessels. Once the drug is administered, 
relatively low-energy laser pulses aimed 
at the abnormal blood vessels are deliv- 
ered to stimulate the drug, which in 
turn destroys the abnormal blood ves- 
sels with minimal damage to the sur- 
rounding tissue. 
The remaining 90% of AMD cases 
are the nonexudative, or "dry," form. 
These patients experience a gradual 
disappearance of the retinal pigment 
epithelium, resulting in circumscribed 
areas of atrophy. Since photoreceptor 
loss follows the disappearance of the 
pigment epithelium, the affected retinal 
areas have little or no visual function. 
Vision loss from dry AMD occurs more 
gradually, typically over the course of 
many years. These patients usually 
retain some central vision, although the 
loss can be severe enough to compro- 
mise performance of tasks that require 
seeing details. Unfortunately, at the 
present time there is no treatment for 
dry AMD. A radical and quite fascinat- 
ing new approach that offers some 
promise entails surgically reposition- 
ing the retina away from the abnormal 
area. 
Occasionally, macular degeneration 
occurs in much younger individuals. 
Many of these cases are caused by a 
number of distinct genetic mutations, 
each with its own clinical manifesta- 
tions. The most common form of juve- 
nile macular degeneration is known as 
Stargardt disease, which is inherited as 
an autosomal recessive. Patients are 
usually diagnosed before they reach the 
age of 20. Although the progression 
of vision loss is variable, most of these 
patients are legally blind by age 50. 
VISION: THE EYE 
235 
Mutations that cause Stargardt disease 
have been identified in the ABCR gene, 
which codes for a protein that trans- 
ports retinoids across the photoreceptor 
membrane. It may be that the abnormal 
gene encodes dysfunctional proteins, 
thereby disrupting the visual cycle of 
photopigment regeneration (see Figure 
11.6). Interestingly, the ABCR gene is 
expressed only in rods, suggesting that 
the cones may have their own visual 
cycle enzymes. 
In sporadic forms of AMD, DNA 
sequence variation in two genes 
involved in the complement cascade— 
factor B and factor H—have been iden- 
tified as risk factors, thereby implicating 
the complement cascade as a potential 
therapeutic target for some forms of

located in the inner nuclear, outer nuclear, and ganglion cell 
layers, and the processes and synaptic contacts located in the 
inner plexiform and outer plexiform layers (Figure 11.5A,B). 
The retina contains two types of photoreceptors, rods and 
cones (Figure 11.5B,C). Both types have an outer segment 
(adjacent to the pigment epithelium), composed of membra- 
nous disks containing light-sensitive photopigment, and an 
inner segment that contains the cell nucleus and gives rise 
to synaptic terminals that contact bipolar or horizontal cells. 
A three-neuron chain—photoreceptor cell to bipolar cell 
to ganglion cell—is the most direct pathway of information 
flow from photoreceptors to the optic nerve. Absorption 
of light by the photopigment in the outer segment of the 
photoreceptors initiates a cascade of events that changes 
the membrane potential of the receptor, and therefore the 
amount of neurotransmitter released by the photoreceptor 
terminals. (This process, called phototransduction, is dis- 
cussed in detail later in the chapter.) The synapses between 

_ Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) refers to a 
_ heterogeneous group of hereditary eye 
_ disorders characterized by progressive 
_ vision loss due to a gradual degenera- 
tion of photoreceptors. An estimated 
100,000 people in the United States 
| have RP. In spite of the name, inflam- 
_ mation is not a prominent part of the 
disease process; instead, the photore- 
_ ceptor cells appear to die by apoptosis 
(determined by the presence of DNA 
fragmentation). 
Classification of this group of disor- 
ders under one rubric is based on the 
clinical features commonly observed. 
The hallmarks of RP are night blind- 
ness, a reduction of peripheral vision, 
narrowing of the retinal vessels, and the 
migration of pigment from disrupted 
retinal pigment epithelium into the 
retina, forming clumps of various sizes, 
often next to retinal blood vessels. 
Typically, patients first notice dif- 
ficulty seeing at night due to the loss 
of rod photoreceptors; the remaining 
cone photoreceptors then become the 
mainstay of visual function. Over many 
years, the cones also degenerate, lead- 
ing to a progressive loss of vision. In 
most RP patients, visual field defects 
begin in the midperiphery, between 30° 
and 50° from the point of foveal fixa- 
tion. The defective regions gradually 
enlarge, leaving islands of vision in the 
periphery and a constricted central 
field—a condition known as tun- 
nel vision. When the visual field 
contracts to 20° or less and/ 
or central vision is 20/200 or 
worse, the person is consid- 
ered to be legally blind. 
Inheritance patterns 
indicate that RP can be 
transmitted in an X-linked 
(XLRP), autosomal domi- 
nant (ADRP), or recessive 
(ARRP) manner. In the 
United States, the percent- 
age of these genetic types is 
estimated to be 9%, 16%, and 
41%, respectively. When only 
one member of a pedigree has RP, 
the case is classified as "simplex," 
BOX 11D 
Retinitis Pigmentosa 
which accounts for about a third of all 
cases. 
Among the three genetic types of 
RP, ADRP is the mildest. These patients 
often retain good central vision until 
they are 60 years of age or older. In 
contrast, patients with the XLRP form 
of the disease are usually legally blind 
by 30 to 40 years of age. However, the 
severity and age of onset of the symp- 
toms varies greatly among patients with 
the same type of RP, and even within 
the same family (when, presumably, all 
the affected members have the same 
genetic mutation). 
To date, RP-inducing mutations of 
30 genes have been identified. Many of 
these genes encode photoreceptor-spe- 
cific proteins, several being associated 
with phototransduction in the rods. 
Among the latter are genes for rhodop- 
sin, subunits of the cGMP phosphodi- 
esterase, and the cGMP-gated channel. 
Multiple mutations have been found 
in each of these cloned genes. For 
example, in the case of the rhodopsin 
gene, 90 different mutations have been 
identified among ADRP patients. 
The heterogeneity of RP at all lev- 
els, from genetic mutations to clinical 
symptoms, has 
important impli- 
cations

for understanding its pathogenesis 
and for designing therapies. Given 
the complex molecular etiology of 
RP, it is unlikely that a single cellu- 
lar mechanism will explain all cases. 
Regardless of the specific mutation or 
causal sequence, the vision loss that 
is most critical is the result of gradual 
degeneration of cones. But in many 
cases, the RP-causing mutation affects 
proteins that are not even expressed in 
the cones—the prime example is the 
rod-specific visual pigment rhodopsin— 
and the loss of cones may be an indi- 
rect result of a rod-specific mutation. 
" 
Identifying the cellular mechanisms that 
directly cause cone degeneration should 
lead to a better understanding of this 
pathology.

CHAPTER 11 
photoreceptor terminals and bipolar cells (and horizontal 
cells) occur in the outer plexiform layer; more specifically, 
the cell bodies of photoreceptors make up the outer nuclear 
layer, whereas the cell bodies of bipolar cells lie in the in- 
ner nuclear layer. The short axonal processes of bipolar cells 
make synaptic contacts in turn on the dendritic processes of 
ganglion cells in the inner plexiform layer. The much larger 
axons of the ganglion cells form the optic nerve and carry 
information about retinal stimulation to the rest of the central 
nervous system. 
The two other types of neurons in the retina, horizontal 
cells and amacrine cells, have their cell bodies in the in- 
ner nuclear layer and have processes that are limited to the 
outer and inner plexiform layers, respectively (see Figure 
11.5B). The processes of horizontal cells enable lateral in- 
teractions between photoreceptors and bipolar cells that are 
thought to maintain the visual system's sensitivity to con- 
trast, over a wide range of light intensities, or luminance. 
The processes of amacrine cells are postsynaptic to bipolar 
cell terminals and presynaptic to the dendrites of ganglion 
cells. Different subclasses of amacrine cells are thought to 
make distinct contributions to visual function. For example, 
one amacrine cell type has an obligatory role in the pathway 
that transmits information from rod photoreceptors to reti- 
nal ganglion cells. Another type is believed to be critical for 
generating the direction-selective responses exhibited by a 
specialized subset of ganglion cells. 
The variety of amacrine cell subtypes illustrates the more 
general rule that, even with only five basic classes of retinal 
neurons, there can be considerable diversity within a given 
cell class. This diversity is also a hallmark of retinal ganglion 
cells and the basis for pathways that convey different sorts 
of information to central targets in a parallel manner, a topic 
that is considered in more detail in Chapter 12. 
Retinal Pigment Epithelium 
The spatial arrangement of retinal layers at first seems 
counterintuitive: light rays must pass through various non- 
light-sensitive elements of the retina as well as the retinal 
vasculature (which branches extensively on the inner sur- 
face of the retina) before reaching the outer segments of 
the photoreceptors, which is where photons are absorbed 
(see Figure 11.5A,B). The reason for this curious feature of 
retinal organization lies in the special relationship that ex- 
ists among the outer segments of the photoreceptors and 
the pigment epithelium. The cells that make up the retinal 
pigment epithelium have long processes that extend into 
the photoreceptor layer, surrounding the tips of the outer 
segments of each photoreceptor (Figure 11.6A). 
The pigment epithelium plays two roles that are criti- 
cal to the function of retinal photoreceptors. First, the 
membranous disks in the outer segment, which house the 
light-sensitive photopigment and other proteins involved 
in phototransduction, have a relatively limited life span of 
about 12 days. New outer segment disks are continuously 
being formed near the base of the outer segment, while 
the oldest disks are removed, or "shed," at the tip of the 
outer segment (Figure 11.6B). During their life span, disks 
move progressively from the base of the outer segment to 
the tip, where the pigment epithelium plays an essential 
role in removing the expended receptor disks. Shedding 
involves the "pinching off" of a clump of receptor disks by 
the outer segment membrane of the photoreceptor. This 
enclosed clump of disks is then phagocytosed by the pig- 
ment epithelium (Figure 11.6C). The epithelium's second 
role, as we will emphasize in more detail in the next section, 
is to regenerate photopigment molecules after they have 
been exposed to light. Photopigment is cycled continuously 
between the outer segment of the photoreceptor and the 
pigment epithelium. 
These considerations, along with the fact that the capil- 
laries in the choroid underlying the pigment epithelium are 
the primary source of nourishment for retinal photorecep- 
tors, presumably explain why rods and cones are found in 
the outermost rather than the innermost layer of the retina. 
Indeed, disruptions in this normal relationship between the 
pigment epithelium and retinal photoreceptors have severe 
consequences for vision (Box 11D, preceding page). 
Photctransduction 
In most sensory systems, activation of a receptor by the ap- 
propriate stimulus causes the cell membrane to depolarize, 
ultimately stimulating an action potential and transmitter 
release onto the neurons it contacts. In the retina, however, 
photoreceptors do not exhibit action potentials; rather, light 
activation causes a graded change in membrane potential 
and a corresponding change in the rate of transmitter re- 
lease onto postsynaptic neurons. Indeed, much of the pro- 
cessing within the retina is mediated by graded potentials, 
largely because action potentials are not required to trans- 
mit information over the relatively short distances involved. 
Perhaps even more surprising is that shining light on a 
photoreceptor, either a rod or a cone, leads to membrane 
hyperpolarization rather than depolarization (Figure 11.7). In 
the dark, the receptor is in a depolarized state, with a mem- 
brane potential of roughly 40 mV (including those portions 
of the cell that release transmitters). Progressive increases in 
the intensity of illumination cause the potential across the 
receptor membrane to become more negative, a response 
that saturates when the membrane potential reaches about 
—65 mV. Although the direction of the potential change may 
seem odd, the only logical requirement for subsequent vi- 
sual processing is a consistent relationship between lumi- 
nance changes and the rate of transmitter release from the 
photoreceptor terminals. As in other nerve cells, transmitter 
release from the synaptic terminals of the photoreceptor is

dependent on voltage-sensitive Ca** channels in the terminal 
membrane. Thus, in the dark, when photoreceptors are rela- 
tively depolarized, the number of open Ca** channels in the 
synaptic terminal is high, and the rate of transmitter release 
is correspondingly great; in the light, when receptors are hy- 
perpolarized, the number of open Ca* channels is reduced, 
and the rate of transmitter release is also reduced. The reason 
for this unusual arrangement compared to other sensory re- 
ceptor cells is not known.

time course of the response). Each trace represents the 
response to a brief flash that was varied in intensity. At the 
highest light levels, the response amplitude saturates (at 
about -65 mV). The hyperpolarizing response is charac- 
teristic of vertebrate photoreceptors. (After Schnapf and

gated by the nucleotide cyclic guanosine monophos- 
phate (cGMP) in a fashion similar to that of other second- 
messenger systems (see Chapter 7). This inward current is 
opposed by an outward current that is mediated by potas- 
sium-selective channels in the inner segment. Thus, the de- 
polarized state of the photoreceptor in the dark reflects the 
net contribution of Na* and Ca** influx, which acts to depo- 
larize the cell, and K* efflux, which acts to hyperpolarize the 
cell (Figure 11.8A). Absorption of light by the photoreceptor 
reduces the concentration of cGMP in the outer segment, 
leading in turn to a closure of the cGMP-gated channels in 
the outer segment membrane and, consequently, a reduc- 
tion in the inward flow of Na* and Ca**. As a result, positive 
charge (carried by K*) flows out of the cell more rapidly 
than positive charge (carried by Na* and Ca**) flows in, and 
the cell becomes hyperpolarized (Figure 11.8B). 
The series of biochemical changes that ultimately leads 
to a reduction in cGMP levels begins when a photon is 
absorbed by the photopigment in the receptor disks. The 
photopigment contains the light-absorbing chromophore 
retinal (an aldehyde of vitamin A) coupled to one of several 
possible proteins called opsins. The different opsins tune 
the molecule's absorption of light to a particular region of 
the spectrum; indeed, it is the differing protein components 
of the photopigments in rods and cones that allows the 
functional specialization of these two receptor types. 
Most of what is known about the molecular events of 
phototransduction has been gleaned from experiments in 
rods, in which the photopigment is rhodopsin. The seven 
transmembrane domains of the opsin molecule traverse the 
membrane of the disks in the outer segment, forming a 
pocket in which the retinal molecule resides (Figure 11.9A). 
When retinal absorbs a photon of light, one of the double 
bonds between the carbon atoms in the retinal molecule 
breaks, and its configuration changes from the 11-cis isomer 
to all-trans retinal (Figure 11.9B); this change triggers a se- 
ries of alterations in the opsin component of the molecule. 
The changes in opsin lead, in turn, to the activation of an 
intracellular messenger called transducin, which activates 
a phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes cGMP. All of these 
events take place within the disk membrane. The hydrolysis 
by phosphodiesterase at the disk membrane lowers cGMP 
concentration throughout the outer segment, thus reduc- 
ing the number of cGMP molecules available to bind to the 
channels in the surface of the outer segment membrane and 
leading in turn to channel closure (Figure 11.90). 
One of the important features of this complex biochemi- 
cal cascade initiated by photon capture is that it provides 
enormous signal amplification. It has been estimated that 
a single light-activated rhodopsin molecule can activate 
800 transducin molecules—roughly 8% of the transducin 
molecules on the disk surface. Although each transducin 
molecule activates only one phosphodiesterase molecule, 
each PDE is capable of catalyzing the breakdown of as 
many as 6 CGMP molecules. As a result, the absorption of 
a single photon by a rhodopsin molecule results in the clo- 
sure of approximately 200 ion channels, or about 2% of the 
number of channels in each rod that are open in the dark. 
This number of channel closures causes a net change in the 
membrane potential of about 1 mV. 
Once initiated, additional mechanisms limit the duration 
of this amplifying cascade and restore the various molecules

to their inactivated states. Activated rhodopsin is rapidly 
phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase, which permits the 
protein arrestin to bind to rhodopsin. Bound arrestin blocks 
the ability of activated rhodopsin to activate transducin, 
thus effectively truncating the phototransduction cascade. 
The restoration of retinal to a form capable of signaling 
photon capture is a complex process known as the retinoid 
cycle (Figure 11.10A). The all-trans retinal dissociates from 
opsin and diffuses into the cytosol of the outer segment, 
there it is converted to all-trans retinol and transported into 
the pigment epithelium via a chaperone protein, interpho- 
toreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP; see Figure 
11.10A), where appropriate enzymes ultimately convert it 
to 11-cis retinal. After being transported back into the outer 
segment via IRBP, 11-cis retinal recombines with opsin in 
the receptor disks. The retinoid cycle is critically important 
for maintaining the light sensitivity of photoreceptors. Even

and thereby greatly extending the range

segment appears to play a key role in the

tor sensitivity. The cGMP-gated channels 
of cell 
in the outer segment are permeable to 
both Na* and Ca** (Figure 11.10B); thus, 
light-induced closure of these channels 
leads to a net decrease in the internal Ca** concentration. 
This decrease triggers a number of changes in the photo- 
transduction cascade, all of which tend to reduce the sen- 
sitivity of the receptor to light. For example, the decrease in 
Ca** increases the activity of guanylate cyclase, the cGMP- 
synthesizing enzyme, leading to increased cGMP levels. 
The decrease in Ca** also increases the activity of rhodop- 
sin kinase, permitting more arrestin to bind to rhodopsin. 
Finally, the decrease in Ca'* increases the affinity of the 
cGMP-gated channels for cGMP, reducing the impact of 
the light-induced reduction of cGMP levels. The regulatory 
effects of Ca** on the phototransduction cascade are only 
one part of the mechanism that adapts retinal sensitivity 
to background levels of illumination; another important 
contribution comes from neural interactions between hori- 
zontal cells and photoreceptor terminals (discussed later in 
this chapter).

(A) Following photoisomerization, all-trans retinal is converted 
into all-trans retinol and is transported by the chaperone pro- 
tein IRBP into the pigment epithelium. There, in a series of 
steps, it is converted to 11-cis retinal and transported back to 
the outer segment (again via IRBP), where it recombines with 
opsin. (B) Photoreceptor adaptation. Calcium in the outer seg- 
ment inhibits the activity of guanylate cyclase and rhodopsin 
kinase, and reduces the affinity of cCGMP-gated channels for 
cGMP. Light-induced closure of channels in the outer segment 
membrane leads to a reduction in Ca?* concentration and a 
reduction in Ca**-mediated inhibition of these elements of the 
cascade. As a result, the photoreceptor's sensitivity to photon 
capture is reduced.

Functional Specialization

Systems 
All-trans

The two types of photoreceptors, rods and 
OH 
cones, are distinguished by shape (from 
which they derive their names), type of 
photopigment they contain, distribution 
across the retina, and pattern 
of synaptic 
connections. These properties reflect the 
fact that the rod and cone systems (i.e., 
the receptor cells and their connections 
within the retina) are specialized for differ- 
ent aspects of vision. The rod system has 
very low spatial resolution but is extremely 
sensitive to light; it is therefore specialized 
for sensitivity at the expense of resolution. 
Conversely, the cone system has very high 
spatial resolution but is relatively insensi- 
tive to light; it is specialized for acuity at 
the expense of sensitivity. The properties 
of the cone system also allow humans and 
many other animals to see color. 
Figure 11.11 shows the range of illu- 
mination over which the rods and cones 
operate. At the lowest levels of illumina- 
tion, only the rods are activated. Such rod- 
mediated perception is called scotopic vi- 
sion. The difficulty of making fine visual 
@ Ca?+ 
discriminations under very low light con- 
@ 
ditions where only the rod system is ac- 
tive is acommon experience. The problem 
is primarily the poor resolution of the rod 
4 
system (and, to a lesser extent, the fact that 
there is no perception of color because in 
dim light there is no significant involve- 
ment of the cones). Although cones begin 
to contribute to visual perception at about 
snes 
the level of starlight, spatial discrimination 
at this light level is still very poor. 
As illumination level increases, cones 
become more and more dominant in 
determining what is seen, and they are the major deter- 
minant of perception under conditions such as normal in- 
door lighting or sunlight. The contributions of rods to vi- 
sion drops out nearly entirely in photopic vision because 
their response to light saturates—that is, the membrane 
potential of individual rods no longer varies as a function 
of illumination because all of the membrane channels are 
closed (see Figure 11.9). Mesopic vision occurs in levels of 
light at which both rods and cones contribute—at twilight, 
for example. From these considerations it should be clear 
that most of what we think of as normal "seeing" is medi- 
ated by the cone system, and that loss of cone function is

lar degeneration (see Box 11C). People who have lost cone 
function are legally blind, whereas those who have lost rod 
function only experience difficulty seeing at low levels of 
illumination (night blindness). 
Differences in the transduction mechanisms utilized 
by the two receptor types are a major factor in the ability 
of rods and cones to respond to different ranges of light

intensity. For example, rods produce a reliable response to 
a single photon of light, whereas more than 100 photons 
are required to produce a comparable response in a cone. 
It is not true, however, that cones fail to effectively capture 
photons. Rather, the change in current produced by single 
photon capture in cones is comparatively small and difficult 
to distinguish from background noise. 
Another difference is that the response of an individual 
cone does not saturate at high levels of steady illumination, 
as the rod response does. Although both rods and cones 
adapt to operate over a range of luminance values, the ad- 
aptation mechanisms of the cones are more effective. This 
difference in adaptation is apparent in the time course of the 
response of rods and cones to light flashes. 
The response of a cone, even to a bright light 
flash that produces the maximum change 
in photoreceptor current, recovers in about 
mT) 
than rod recovery (Figure 11.12A).

from 15-30 rods. Additional convergence occurs at down- 
stream sites in the rod pathway (see text). In contrast, in 
the center of the fovea, each bipolar cell receives its input 
from a single cone and synapses with a single ganglion 
pt 
cell. (A after Baylor, 1987.) 

244 
CHAPTER 11 
The arrangement of the circuits that transmit rod and 
cone information to retinal ganglion cells also contributes to 
the different characteristics of scotopic and photopic vision. 
In most parts of the retina, rod and cone signals converge 
on the same ganglion cells; that is, individual ganglion cells 
respond to both rod and cone inputs, depending on the 
level of illumination. The early stages of the pathways that 
link rods and cones to ganglion cells, however, are largely 
independent. For example, the pathway from rods to gan- 
glion cells involves a distinct class of rod bipolar cells that, 
unlike cone bipolar cells, do not contact retinal ganglion 
cells. Instead, rod bipolar cells synapse with the dendritic 
processes of a specific class of amacrine cells that makes gap 
junctions and chemical synapses with the terminals of cone 
bipolars; these processes, in turn, make synaptic contacts 
on the dendrites of ganglion cells in the inner plexiform 
layer. Another dramatic difference between rod and cone

circuitry is their degree of convergence (Figure 11.12B). 
Each rod bipolar cell is contacted by a number of rods, and 
many rod bipolar cells contact a given amacrine cell. In con- 
trast, the cone system is much less convergent. Thus, each 
of the retinal ganglion cells that dominate central vision 
(called midget ganglion cells) receives input from only one 
cone bipolar cell, which, in turn, is contacted by a single 
cone. Convergence makes the rod system a better detector 
of light, because small signals from many rods are pooled 
to generate a large response in the bipolar cell. At the same 
time, convergence reduces the spatial resolution of the rod 
system, since the source of a signal in a rod bipolar cell or 
retinal ganglion cell could have come from anywhere within 
a relatively large area of the retinal surface. The one-to-one 
relationship of cones to bipolar and ganglion cells is just 
what is required to maximize acuity. 
Anatomical Distribution 
of Rods and Cones 
The distribution of rods and cones across the surface of the 
retina also has important consequences for vision. Despite 
the fact that perception in typical daytime light levels is 
dominated by cone-mediated vision, the total number of 
rods in the human retina (about 90 million) far exceeds 
the number of cones (roughly 4.5 million). As a result, the 
density of rods is much greater than that of cones through- 
out most of the retina (Figure 11.13A). However, this re- 
lationship changes dramatically in the fovea, the highly 
FIGURE 11.13 
Distribution of photoreceptors in the 
human retina. (A) Cones are present at a low density through- 
out the retina, with a sharp peak in the center of the fovea (the 
foveola). Conversely, rods are present at high density through- 
out most of the retina, with a sharp decline in the fovea; rods 
are absent in the foveola. Boxes show face-on sections through 
the outer segments of the photoreceptors at different eccen- 
tricities. The increased density of cones in the fovea is accom- 
panied by a striking reduction in the diameter of their outer 
segments. Note also the lack of receptors at the optic disk, 
where retinal ganglion cell axons gather to exit the retina. (B)

specialized region in the center of the macula that measures 
about 1.2 millimeters in diameter (see Figure 11.1). In the 
fovea (which literally means "pit"), cone density increases 
almost 200-fold, reaching, at its center, the highest receptor 
packing density anywhere in the retina. This high density 
is achieved by decreasing the diameter of the cone outer 
segments such that foveal cones resemble rods in their ap- 
pearance. The increased density of cones in the fovea is 
accompanied by a sharp decline in the density of rods. In 
fact, the central 300 um of the fovea, called the foveola, is 
totally rod-free (Figure 11.13B). 
The extremely high density of cone receptors in the fo- 
vea, coupled with the one-to-one relationship with bipolar 
cells and retinal ganglion cells (see Figure 11.12), endows this 
component of the cone system with the capacity to mediate 
the highest levels of visual acuity. As cone density declines 
with eccentricity and the degree of convergence onto retinal 
ganglion cells increases, acuity is markedly reduced. Just 6 
degrees eccentric to the line of sight, acuity is reduced by 
75%, a fact that can be readily appreciated by trying to read 
the words on any line of this page beyond the word being 
fixated on. The restriction of highest acuity vision to such a 
small region of the retina is the main reason humans spend 
so much time moving their eyes (and heads) around—in 
effect directing the foveas of the two eyes to objects of in- 
terest (see Chapter 20). It is also the reason why disorders 
that affect the functioning of the fovea have such devastating 
effects on sight (see Box 11C). Conversely, the exclusion of 
rods from the fovea, and their presence in high density away 
from the fovea, explain why the threshold for detecting a 
light stimulus is lower outside the region of central vision. It 
is easier to see a dim object (such as a faint star) by looking 
slightly away from it, so that the stimulus falls on the region 
of the retina that is richest in rods (see Figure 11.13A). 
Another anatomical feature of the fovea that contributes 
to the superior acuity of the cone system is the displacement

of the inner layers of the retina such that photons are sub- 
jected to a minimum of scattering before they strike the 
photoreceptors. The fovea is also devoid of another source 
of optical distortion that lies in the light path to the recep- 
tors elsewhere in the retina—the retinal blood vessels (see 
Figure 11.13B). This avascular central region of the fovea 
is thus dependent on the underlying choroid and pigment 
epithelium for oxygenation and metabolic sustenance. 
Cones and Color Vision 
Perceiving color allows humans and many other animals to 
discriminate objects on the basis of the distribution of the 
wavelengths of light that they reflect to the eye. While differ- 
ences in luminance are often sufficient to distinguish objects, 
color adds another perceptual dimension that is especially 
useful when differences in light intensity are subtle or non- 
existent. Color obviously gives us a quite different way of 
perceiving and describing the world we live in, and our color 
vision is the result of special properties of the cone system. 
Unlike rods, which contain a single photopigment, the 
three types of cones differ in the photopigment they con- 
tain. Each photopigment is differentially sensitive to light of 
different wavelengths, and for this reason cones are referred 
to as "blue," "green," and "red" or, more appropriately, as 
short (S), medium (M), and long (L) wavelength cones— 
terms that more or less describe their spectral sensitivities 
(Figure 11.14A). This nomenclature can be a bit misleading 
in that it seems to imply that individual cones provide color 
information for the wavelength of light that excites them 
best. In fact, individual cones, like rods, are entirely color- 
blind in that their response is simply a reflection of the

divided by intensity of transmitted 
light.) Solid curves represent the three 
cone opsins; the dashed curve shows 
rod rhodopsin for comparison. (B) 
Using a technology known as adaptive 
optics and clever "tricks" of light adap- 
tation, it is possible to map with great 
precision the distribution of different 
cone types within the living retina. 
Pseudocolor has been used to identify 
the short- (blue), medium- (green), 
and long-wavelength (red) cones.

CHAPTER 11 
BOX 11E The Importance of Context in Color Perception 
Seeing color logically demands that ret- 
_ inal responses to different wavelengths 
_ in some way be compared. The three 
human cone types and their different 
_ absorption spectra are therefore cor- 
_ rectly regarded as the basis for human 
color vision. Nevertheless, how these 
_ human cone types and the higher-order 
neurons they contact (see Chapter 12) 
produce the sensations of color is still 
unclear. Indeed, some of the greatest 
minds in science (Hering, Helmholtz, 
Maxwell, Schroedinger, and Mach, to 
name only a few) have debated this 
_ issue since Thomas Young first pro- 
posed that humans must have three 
different receptive "particles"—i.e., the 
three cone types. 
A fundamental problem has been 
that, although the relative activities 
of three cone types can more or less 
explain the colors perceived in color- 
matching experiments performed in 
the laboratory, the perception of color 
is strongly influenced by context. 
For example, a patch returning the 
exact same spectrum of wavelengths 
to the eye can appear quite different 
depending on its surround, a phe- 
nomenon called color contrast (Figure 
A). Moreover, test patches returning 
different spectra to the eye can appear 
to be the same color, an effect called 
color constancy (Figure B). Although 
these phenomena were well known 
in the nineteenth century, they were 
not accorded a central place in color 
vision theory until Edwin Land's work 
in the 1950s. In his most famous dem- 
onstration, Land (who, among other 
achievements, founded the Polaroid 
Corporation and became a billionaire) 
used a collage of colored papers that 
have been referred to as "the Land 
Mondrians" because of their similar- 
ity to the work of the Dutch artist Piet 
Mondrian. 
Using a telemetric photometer and 
three adjustable illuminators generating 
short-, middle-, and long-wavelength 
light, Land showed that two patches 
that in white light appeared quite dif- 
ferent in color (e.g., green and brown) 
continued to look their respective 
colors even when the three illuminators 
were adjusted so that the light being 
returned from the "green" surfaces 
produced exactly the same readings 
on the three telephotometers as had 
previously come from the "brown" 
surface—a striking demonstration of 
color constancy. 
The phenomena of color contrast 
and color constancy have led to a 
heated modern debate about how color 
percepts are generated that now spans 
several decades. For Land, the answer 
lay in a series of ratiometric equations 
that could integrate the spectral returns 
of different regions over the entire 
scene. It was recognized even before 
Land's death in 1991, however, that his 
so-called retinex theory did not work in 
all circumstances and was in any event 
a description rather than an explana- 
tion. An alternative explanation of these 
contextual aspects of color vision is 
that color, like brightness, is generated 
empirically according to what spectral 
stimuli have typically signified in past 
experience (see Box 11F).

number of photons they capture, regardless of the wave- 
length of the photon (or, more properly, its vibrational en- 
ergy). It is impossible, therefore, to determine whether the 
change in the membrane potential of a particular cone has 
arisen from exposure to many photons at wavelengths to 
which the receptor is relatively insensitive, or fewer photons 
at wavelengths to which it is most sensitive. This ambiguity 
can be resolved only by comparing the activity in different 
classes of cones. Based on the responses of individual gan- 
glion cells and cells at higher levels in the visual pathway 
(see Chapter 12), comparisons of this type are clearly in- 
volved in how the visual system extracts color information 
from spectral stimuli, although a full understanding of the 
neural mechanisms that underlie color perception has been 
elusive (Box 11E). 
While it might seem natural to assume that the three 
cone types are present in roughly the same number, this 
is clearly not the case. S cones make up only 
about 5-10% of the cones in the retina, and

have a deficiency in color vision (commonly referred to as 
color blindness) that manifests as difficulty in distinguish- 
ing colors that are easily perceived by individuals with 
normal trichromatic vision. For some of these individuals, 
color vision is dichromatic: only two bandwidths of light 
are needed to match all the colors that can be perceived. 
The two most prevalent forms of dichromacy are protanopia, 
characterized by impairment in perception of long wave- 
lengths, and deuteranopia, impairment in the perception of 
medium wavelengths. Although there are differences in the 
color discrimination capabilities of protanopes and deuter- 
anopes, both have difficulties with the discrimination of red 
and green, and for this reason dichromacy is commonly 
called red-green color blindness (Figure 11.15). The other 
form of dichromacy, tritanopia, is extremely rare. Tritanopes 
have impaired perception of short wavelengths, a condition 
commonly called blue-yellow color blindness. 
they are virtually absent from the center of — (A) Normal (trichromat) 
the fovea. Although the M and L types are the 
predominant retinal cones, the ratio of M to 
L varies considerably from individual to indi- 
vidual, as has been shown using optical tech- 
niques that permit visualization of identified 
cone types in the intact human retina (Figure 
11.14B). Interestingly, large differences in the 
ratio of M and L cone types (from nearly 4:1 to 
1:1) do not appear to have a significant impact 
on color perception. 
Thus, normal human color vision is funda- 
mentally trichromatic, based on the relative 
levels of activity in three sets of cones that have 
different absorption spectra. The trichromatic 
nature of color vision is supported by percep- 
tual studies showing that any color stimulus 
can be matched to a second stimulus composed 
of three superimposed light sources (long, 
medium, and short wavelengths), provided 
the intensity of the light sources can be inde- 
pendently adjusted. But about 8% of the male 
population in the United States (and a much 
smaller percentage of the female population)

CHAPTER 11 
The majority of individuals with color vision deficiencies, 
however, are anomalous trichromats. In this condition, 
three light sources (i.e., short, medium, and long wave- 
lengths) are needed to make all possible color matches; but 
the matches are made using intensity values significantly dif- 
ferent from those used by most individuals. Some anomalous 
trichromats require higher intensity long-wavelength stimu- 
lation to make color matches (protanomalous trichromats), 
while other require higher intensity medium- (deuteranom- 
alous trichromats) or short-wavelength stimulation (trit- 
anomalous trichromats). Anomalous trichromats may not 
be aware that they have a color vision deficiency and often 
pass as normal observers in everyday activities. Dichromats, 
on the other hand, can be severely color deficient, creating 
significant safety concerns and, in some cases, limiting career 
opportunities. In professions where color discriminations 
play a critical role in performance (airline pilots, firefighters, 
police officers, operators of public transportation, etc.) nor- 
mal color vision capabilities are often a requirement. 
Color vision deficiencies result either from the inherited 
failure to make one or more of the cone pigments, or from 
an alteration in the absorption spectra of cone pigments 
(or, rarely, from lesions in the central stations that process 
color information; see Chapter 12). Jeremy Nathans and 
his colleagues at Johns Hopkins University have provided 
a deeper understanding of color vision deficiencies by iden- 
tifying and sequencing the genes that encode the three hu- 
man cone pigments (Figure 11.16A). The genes that encode

the red and green pigments show a high degree of sequence 
homology and lie adjacent to each other on the X chromo- 
some, thus explaining the prevalence of red-green color 
blindness in males. Normal trichromats have one gene for 
the red pigments and can have anywhere from one to five 
genes for green pigments. In contrast, the blue-sensitive 
pigment gene, found on chromosome 7, is quite different 
in its amino acid sequence. These facts suggest that the 
red and green pigment genes evolved relatively recently, 
perhaps as a result of the duplication of a single ancestral 
gene; they also explain why most color vision abnormalities 
involve the red and green cone pigments. 
Human dichromats lack one of the three cone pigments, 
either because the corresponding gene is missing or be- 
cause it exists as a hybrid of the red and green pigment 
genes (Figure 11.16B,C). For example, some dichromats 
lack the green pigment gene altogether, while others have 
a hybrid gene that is thought to produce a red-like pigment

of rhodopsin and the S-cone pigment, and 
between the S- and M-cone pigments; how- 
ever, only a few amino acid differences sepa- 
rate the M- and L-cone pigment sequences. 
(B,C) Many deficiencies of color vision arise 
from alterations in the M- or L-cone pigment

in the "green" cones. Anomalous trichromats also possess 
hybrid genes, but these genes elaborate pigments whose 
spectral properties lie between those of the normal red and 
green pigments. Thus, although most anomalous trichro- 
mats have distinct sets of medium- and long-wavelength 
cones, there is more overlap in their absorption spectra than 
in normal trichromats, and thus less difference in how the 
two sets of cones respond to a given wavelength, with re- 
sulting anomalies in color perception. 
At present there is no cure for color deficiencies. How- 
ever, experiments in animals that are natural dichromats 
(in mammals, trichromatic vision is limited to Old World 
primates) have shown that it is possible to use molecular 
techniques to express an additional pigment in a subset of 
cone photoreceptors, and that this manipulation is suffi- 
cient to support trichromatic color discriminations. These 
observations offer the hope that color deficiencies may one 
day be ameliorated through gene therapy. 
Retinal Circuits for Detecting 
Luminance Change 
Despite the aesthetic pleasure inherent in color vision, 
most of the information in visual scenes consists of spatial 
variations in light intensity; a black-and-white movie, for 
example, has most of the information a color version has, 
although it is deficient in some respects and usually is less

interesting to watch. The mechanisms by which central tar- 
gets decipher the spatial patterns of light and dark that fall 
on the photoreceptors has been a vexing problem (Box 11F). 
To understand what the complex neural circuits within the 
retina accomplish during this process, it is useful to begin 
by considering the responses of individual retinal ganglion 
cells to small spots of light. 
Stephen Kuffler, working at The Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity, pioneered this approach in the 1950s when he charac- 
terized the responses of single ganglion cells in the cat retina. 
He found that each ganglion cell responds to stimulation of 
a small circular patch of the retina, which defines the cell's 
receptive field (see Chapter 9 for a discussion of receptive 
fields). Based on these responses, Kuffler distinguished two 
classes of ganglion cells, "on"-center and "off"-center. Turn- 
ing on a spot of light in the receptive field center of an on- 
center ganglion cell produces a burst of action potentials. 
The same stimulus applied to the receptive field center of an 
off-center ganglion cell reduces the rate of discharge, and 
when the spot of light is turned off, the cell responds with a 
burst of action potentials (Figure 11.17A). Complementary

assumption that the central nervous

plest place to consider this challenge. 
As indicated in the text, how we see

patterns of activity are found for each cell type when a dark 
spot is placed in the receptive field center (Figure 11.17B). 
Thus, on-center cells increase their discharge rate to lumi- 
nance increments in the receptive field center, whereas off- 
center cells increase their discharge rate to luminance decre- 
ments in the receptive field center. 
On- and off-center ganglion cells are present in roughly 
equal numbers. The receptive fields have overlapping dis- 
tributions, so several on-center and several off-center gan- 
glion cells analyze every point on the retinal surface (i.e., 
every part of visual space). Peter Schiller and his colleagues 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who exam- 
ined the effects of pharmacologically inactivating on-center 
ganglion cells on a monkey's ability to detect visual stimuli, 
suggested a rationale for having two distinct types of retinal 
ganglion cells. After silencing on-center ganglion cells, the 
animals showed a deficit in their ability to detect stimuli

help make this point. In Figure A, two

photometrically identical (equiluminant) 
gray squares appear differently bright as 
a function of the background in which 
they are presented. 
A conventional interpretation of this 
phenomenon is that the receptive field 
properties illustrated in Figures 11.14 
through 11.17 cause ganglion cells to 
fire differently depending on whether 
the surround of the equiluminant tar- 
get is dark or light. The demonstration 
in Figure B, however, undermines this 
explanation, since in this case the target 
surrounded by more dark area actually 
looks darker than the same target sur- 
rounded by more light area. 
An alternative interpretation of 
luminance perception that can account 
for these puzzling phenomena is that 
brightness percepts are generated on 
a statistical basis as a means of con- 
tending with the inherent ambiguity 
of luminance (i.e., the fact that a given 
value of luminance can be generated 
by many different combinations of

that were brighter than the background; however, they 
could still see objects that were darker than the background. 
These observations imply that information about in- 
creases or decreases in luminance is carried separately to 
the brain by the axons of the two types of retinal ganglion 
cells. Having separate luminance "channels" means that 
changes in light intensity, whether increases or decreases, 
are always conveyed to the brain by an increased number 
of action potentials. Because ganglion cells rapidly adapt 
to changes in luminance, their "resting" discharge rate in 
constant illumination is relatively low. Although an increase 
in discharge rate above resting level serves as a reliable sig- 
nal, a decrease in firing rate from an initially low rate of 
discharge might not be. Having luminance changes sig- 
naled by two classes of adaptable cells provides unambigu- 
ous information about both increments and decrements in 
luminance.

illumination and surface reflectance 
_ properties). Since to be successful an 
observer has to respond to the real- 
_ world sources of luminance and not 
to light intensity as such, this ambigu- 
ity of the retinal stimulus presents a 
quandary. A plausible solution to the 
inherent uncertainty of the relationship 
between luminance values and their 
actual sources would be to generate 
the sensation of brightness elicited by 
a given luminance (e.g., in the bright- 
ness of the identical test patches in the 
a variety of possible sources, it makes 
sense to have the brightness elicited by 
the patches determined statistically by 
the relative frequency of occurrence of 
that luminance in the particular context 
in which it is presented. The advantage 
of seeing luminance according to the 
relative probabilities of the possible 
sources of the stimulus is that percepts 
generated in this way give the observer 
the best chance of making appropri- 
ate behavioral responses to profoundly 
ambiguous stimuli.

The functional differences between these two cell types 
can be understood in terms of both their anatomy and their 
physiological properties and relationships. On- and off- 
center ganglion cells have dendrites that arborize in sepa- 
rate strata of the inner plexiform layer, forming synapses 
selectively with the terminals of on- and off-center bipolar 
cells that respond to luminance increases and decreases, 
respectively (Figure 11.18A). As mentioned previously, the 
principal difference between ganglion cells and bipolar cells 
lies in the nature of their electrical response. Like most 
other cells in the retina, bipolar cells have graded poten- 
tials rather than action potentials. Graded depolarization 
of bipolar cells leads to an increase in transmitter release 
(glutamate) at their synapses and consequent depolariza- 
tion of the on-center ganglion cells that they contact via 
AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors. 
(C) Cartoons of some possible sources of the standard simultaneous bright- 
ness contrast illusion in (A). (Courtesy of R. B. Lotto and D. Purves.) 
The selective response of on- and off-center bipolar cells 
to light increments and decrements is explained by the fact 
that they express different types of glutamate receptors 
(see Figure 11.18A). Off-center bipolar cells have iono- 
tropic receptors (AMPA and kainate) that cause the cells to 
depolarize in response to glutamate released from photo- 
receptor terminals. In contrast,,on-center bipolar cells ex- 
press a G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate recep- 
tor (mGluR6). When bound to glutamate, these receptors 
activate an intracellular cascade that closes cGMP-gated 
Na* channels, reducing inward current and hyperpolariz- 
ing the cell. Thus, glutamate has opposite effects on these 
two classes of cells, depolarizing off-center bipolar cells and 
hyperpolarizing on-center cells. Photoreceptor synapses 
with off-center bipolar cells are described as sign-conserv- 
ing, since the sign of the change in membrane potential of

the bipolar cell (depolarization or hyperpolarization) is the 
same as that in the photoreceptor. Photoreceptor synapses 
with on-center bipolar cells are called sign-inverting because 
the change in the membrane potential of the bipolar cell is 
the opposite of that in the photoreceptor. 
In order to understand the response of on- and off- 
center bipolar cells to changes in light intensity, recall that 
photoreceptors hyperpolarize in response to light incre- 
ments, decreasing their release of neurotransmitter (Figure 
11.18B). Under these conditions, on-center bipolar cells

contacted by the photoreceptors are freed from the hyper- 
polarizing influence of the photoreceptor's transmitter, and 
they depolarize. In contrast, for off-center cells, the reduc- 
tion in glutamate represents the withdrawal of a depolar- 
izing influence, and these cells hyperpolarize. Decrements 
in light intensity naturally have the opposite effect on these 
two classes of bipolar cells, hyperpolarizing on-center cells 
and depolarizing off-center ones (Figure 11.18C). 
Kuffler's work also called attention to the fact that retinal 
ganglion cells do not act as simple photodetectors. Indeed, 
most ganglion cells are relatively poor at signaling differ- 
ences in the level of diffuse illumination. Instead, they are 
sensitive to differences between the level of illumination that 
falls on the receptive field center and the level of illumi- 
nation that falls on the surround—that is, to luminance 
contrast. The center of a ganglion cell receptive field is sur- 
rounded by a concentric region that, when stimulated, an- 
tagonizes the response to stimulation of the receptive field 
center (see Figure 11.17C). For example, as a spot of light is

moved from the center of the receptive field of an on-center 
cell toward its periphery, the response of the cell to the spot 
of light decreases. When the spot falls completely outside 
the center (that is, in the surround), the response of the cell 
falls below its resting level; the cell is effectively inhibited 
until the distance from the center is so great that the spot 
no longer falls on the receptive field at all, in which case the 
cell returns to its resting level of firing (Figure 11.19A). Off- 
center cells exhibit a similar surround antagonism. Stimula- 
tion of the surround by light opposes the decrease in firing 
rate that occurs when the center is stimulated alone, and 
it reduces the response to light decrements in the center. 
Because of their antagonistic surrounds, most ganglion 
cells respond much more vigorously to small spots of light 
confined to their receptive field centers than to either 
large spots or to uniform illumination of the visual field.

tive field. (B) Responses of a hypothetical population of 
on-center ganglion cells whose receptive fields (A—E) 
are distributed across a light-dark edge. Those cells 
whose activity is most affected have receptive fields 
that lie along the light-dark edge. 
To appreciate how center-surround antagonism 
makes the ganglion cell sensitive to luminance 
contrast, consider the activity levels in a hypo- 
thetical population of on-center ganglion cells 
whose receptive fields are distributed across a 
retinal image of a light-dark edge (Figure 11.19B). 
The neurons whose firing rates are most affected 
by this stimulus—either increased (neuron D) or 
decreased (neuron B)—are those with receptive 
fields that lie along the light-dark border; those 
with receptive fields completely illuminated (or 
completely darkened) are less affected (neurons 
A and E). Thus, the information supplied by the 
retina to central visual stations for further process- 
ing does not give equal weight to all regions of 
the visual scene; rather, it emphasizes the regions 
where there are differences in luminance. 
Contribution of Retinal Circuits 
to Light Adaptation 
In addition to making ganglion cells especially 
sensitive to light-dark borders in the visual scene, 
center-surround mechanisms make a significant 
contribution to the process of light adaptation. In 
Figure 11.20, the response rate of an on-center ganglion cell 
to a small spot of light turned on in its receptive field center 
varies as a function of the spot's intensity. In fact, response 
rate is proportional to the spot's intensity over a range of 
about 1 log unit. However, the intensity of spot illumina- 
tion required to evoke a given discharge rate is dependent 
on the background level of illumination. Increases in back- 
ground level of illumination are accompanied by adaptive 
shifts in the cell's operating range such that greater stimulus 
intensities are required to achieve the same discharge rate. 
Thus, firing rate is not an absolute measure of light inten- 
sity, but rather signals the difference from background level of 
illumination. 
Because the range of light intensities over which we can 
see is enormous compared to the narrow range of gan- 
elion cell discharge rates (see Figure 11.11), adaptational

represents the discharge rate evoked by spots of

illumination, which is given by the red numbers at 
the top of each curve. The highest background level 
is 0, the lowest -5. Examples at top of figure depict 
the receptive field at different background levels of 
illumination. The response rate is proportional to 
stimulus intensity over a range of 1 log unit, but the 
operating range shifts to the right as the background 
level of illumination increases. (After Sakmann and

mechanisms are essential. By scaling the gan- 
glion cell's response to ambient levels of illumi- 
nation, the entire dynamic range of a neuron's 
firing rate is used to encode information about 
intensity differences over the range of luminance values 
that are relevant for a given visual scene. Due to the an- 
tagonistic center-surround organization of retinal ganglion 
cells, the signal sent to the brain from the retina down- 
plays the background level of illumination. This arrange- 
ment presumably explains why the relative brightness of 
objects remains much the same over a wide range of light- 
ing conditions. The print on this page, for example, reflects 
considerably more light to the eye when we see it in bright 
sunlight than when we read it in room light. In fact, the 
print reflects more light in sunlight than the paper reflects 
in room light; yet the print continues to look black and the 
page white, indoors or out. 
Like the mechanism responsible for generating the on- 
and off-center response, the antagonistic surround of gan- 
gelion cells is thought to be a product of interactions that 
occur at the early stages of retinal processing. Much of the 
antagonism is believed to arise via lateral connections es- 
tablished by horizontal cells and receptor terminals (Figure 
11.21). Horizontal cells receive synaptic inputs from photo- 
receptor terminals and are linked via gap junctions with a 
vast network of other horizontal cells distributed over a wide 
area of the retinal surface. As a result, the activity in horizon- 
tal cells reflects levels of illumination over a broad area of the 
retina. Although the details of their actions are not entirely 
clear, horizontal cells are thought to exert their influence via 
the release of neurotransmitter directly onto photorecep- 
tor terminals, regulating the amount of transmitter that the 
photoreceptors release onto bipolar cell dendrites. 
Glutamate release from photoreceptor terminals has a 
depolarizing effect on horizontal cells (sign-conserving syn- 
apse), while the transmitter released from horizontal cells 
(GABA) has a hyperpolarizing influence on photoreceptor

terminals (sign-inverting synapse) (Figure 11.21A). As a 
result, the net effect of inputs from the horizontal cell net- 
work is to oppose changes in the membrane potential of 
the photoreceptor that are induced by phototransduction 
events in the outer segment. Figure 11.21B illustrates how 
these events lead to surround suppression in an on-center 
ganglion cell. A small spot of light centered on a photore- 
ceptor supplying input to the center of the ganglion cell's 
receptive field produces a strong hyperpolarizing response 
in the photoreceptor. Under these conditions, changes in 
the membrane potential of the horizontal cells that syn- 
apse with the photoreceptor terminal are relatively small, 
and the response of the photoreceptor to light is largely 
determined by its phototransduction cascade. With the 
addition of light to the surround, however, the impact of 
the horizontal network becomes significantly greater; the 
light-induced reduction in the release of glutamate from the 
photoreceptors in the surround leads to a strong hyperpo- 
larization of the horizontal cells whose processes converge 
on the terminal of the photoreceptor in the receptive field 
center. The reduction in GABA release from the horizontal 
cells has a depolarizing effect on the-membrane potential 
of the central photoreceptor, reducing the light-evoked re- 
sponse, and ultimately reducing the firing rate of the on- 
center ganglion cell. 
Thus, even at the earliest stages in visual processing, 
neural signals do not represent the absolute numbers of 
photons that are captured by a receptor, but rather the rela- 
tive intensity of stimulation—how much the current level of 
stimulation differs from ambient levels. While it may seem 
that the actions of horizontal cells decrease the sensitivity of 
the retina, they play a critical role in allowing the full range 
of the photoreceptor's electrical response (about 30 mV)

Summary 
Light falling on photoreceptors is transformed by retinal 
circuitry into a pattern of action potentials that ganglion cell 
axons convey to the visual centers in the brain. This process 
begins with phototransduction, a biochemical cascade that 
ultimately regulates the opening and closing of ion chan- 
nels in the membrane of the photoreceptor's outer segment, 
and thereby the amount of neurotransmitter the photore- 
ceptor releases. Two systems of photoreceptors—rods and 
cones—allow the visual system to meet the conflicting de- 
mands of sensitivity and acuity, respectively. Retinal gan- 
glion cells operate quite differently from the photoreceptor 
cells. The center—-surround arrangement of ganglion cell re- 
ceptive fields makes these neurons particularly sensitive to

luminance contrast and relatively insensitive to the overall 
level of illumination. It also allows the retina to adapt, such 
that it can respond effectively over the enormous range of 
illuminant intensities in the world. The underlying orga- 
nization is generated by the synaptic interactions among 
photoreceptors, horizontal cells, and bipolar cells in the 
outer plexiform layer. As a result, the signal sent to the vi- 
sual centers in the brain is already highly processed when 
it leaves the retina, emphasizing those aspects of the visual 
scene that convey the most information.

CENTRAL VISUAL 
PATHWAYS 
Overview 
INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE RETINA initiates interactions among multiple 
subdivisions of the brain; these interactions eventually lead to conscious perception 
of the visual scene. At the same time, they stimulate more conventional reflexes such 
as adjustment of the pupil, direction of the eyes toward targets of interest, and regula- 
tion of homeostatic behaviors that are tied to the day-night cycle. The pathways and 
structures mediating this broad range of functions are necessarily diverse. Of these, 
the primary visual pathway from the retina to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in 
the thalamus and on to the primary visual cortex is the most important and certainly 
the most thoroughly studied component of the visual system. Different classes of 
neurons within this pathway encode the variety of visual information—luminance, 
spectral differences, orientation, and motion—that we ultimately "see." The parallel 
processing of different categories of visual information continues in cortical pathways 
that extend beyond the primary visual cortex, supplying visual areas in the occipital, 
parietal, and temporal lobes. Visual areas in the temporal lobe are primarily involved 
in object recognition, whereas those in the parietal lobe are concerned with motion. 
Normal vision depends on the integration of information in all these cortical areas. 
The processes underlying visual perception are not well understood and remain one 
of the central challenges of modern neuroscience. 
Central Projections of Retinal Ganglion Cells 
As we saw in Chapter 11, ganglion cell axons exit the retina through a circular region 
in its nasal part called the optic disk (or optic papilla), where they bundle together 
to form the optic nerve. Axons in the optic nerve run a straight course to the optic 
chiasm at the base of the diencephalon (Figure 12.1). In humans, about 60% of these 
fibers cross in the chiasm; the other 40% continue toward thalamus and midbrain 
targets on the same side. 
Once past the optic chiasm, the ganglion cell axons on each side form the optic 
tract. Thus, the optic tract, unlike the optic nerve, contains fibers from both eyes. The 
partial crossing (decussation) of ganglion cell axons at the optic chiasm allows informa- 
tion from corresponding points on the two retinas to be processed by approximately

the same cortical site in each hemisphere, an important fea- 
ture that will be considered in the next section. 
The ganglion cell axons in the optic tract reach a number 
of structures in the diencephalon and midbrain (see Figure 
12.1). The major target in the diencephalon is the dorsal 
lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. Neurons in 
the lateral geniculate nucleus, like their counterparts in the 
thalamic relays of other sensory systems, send their axons 
to the cerebral cortex via the internal capsule. These axons 
pass through a portion of the internal capsule called the 
optic radiation and terminate in the primary visual cor- 
tex (V1), or striate cortex (also referred to as Brodmann's 
area 17), which lies largely along and within the calcarine 
fissure in the occipital lobe. The retinogeniculostriate 
pathway, or primary visual pathway, conveys informa- 
tion that is essential for most of what is thought of as see- 
ing; damage anywhere along this route results in serious 
visual impairment. 
A second major target of ganglion cell axons is a col- 
lection of neurons that lies between the thalamus and the 
midbrain in a region known as the pretectum. Although 
small in size compared with the lateral geniculate nucleus, 
the pretectum is particularly important as the coordinating 
center for the pupillary light reflex (i.c., the reduction in 
the diameter of the pupil that occurs when sufficient light 
falls on the retina; Figure 12.2). The initial component of the 
pupillary light reflex pathway is a bilateral projection from 
the retina to the pretectum. 
Pretectal neurons, in turn, project to the Edinger—West- 
phal nucleus, a small group of nerve cells that lies close 
to the nucleus of the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) 
in the midbrain. The Edinger—-Westphal nucleus contains 
the preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that send their 
of head and eyes 
axons via the oculomotor nerve to terminate on neurons in 
the ciliary ganglion (see Chapter 20). Neurons in the ciliary 
ganglion innervate the constrictor muscle in the iris, which 
decreases the diameter of the pupil when activated. Shin- 
ing light in the eye leads to an increase in the activity of 
pretectal neurons, which stimulates the Edinger—Westphal 
neurons and the ciliary ganglion neurons they innervate, 
thus constricting the pupil. 
In addition to its normal role in regulating the amount 
of light that enters the eye, the pupillary reflex provides 
an important diagnostic tool that allows the physician to 
test the integrity of the visual sensory apparatus, the motor 
outflow to the pupillary muscles, and the central pathways 
that mediate the reflex. Under normal conditions, the pupils 
of both eyes respond identically, regardless of which eye is 
stimulated; that is, light in one eye produces constriction 
of both the stimulated eye (the direct response) and the 
unstimulated eye (the consensual response). Comparing 
the responses in the two eyes is often helpful in localiz- 
ing a lesion. For example, a direct response in the left eye 
without a consensual response in the right eye suggests a 
problem with the visceral motor outflow to the right eye, 
possibly as a result of damage to the oculomotor nerve or 
Edinger—Westphal nucleus in the brainstem. Failure to elicit 
a response (either direct or indirect) to stimulation of the 
left eye if both eyes respond normally to stimulation of the 
right eye suggests damage to the sensory input from the left 
eye, possibly to the left retina or optic nerve. 
Retinal ganglion cell axons have several other impor- 
tant targets. One is the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the 
hypothalamus, a small group of neurons at the base of the 
diencephalon (see Box 21A). The retinohypothalamic 
pathway is the route by which variation in light levels

influences the broad spectrum of visceral functions that are 
entrained to the day-night cycle (see Chapter 28). Another 
target is the superior colliculus, a prominent structure vis- 
ible on the dorsal surface of the midbrain (see Figures 12.1 
and 12.2). The superior colliculus coordinates head and eye 
movements to visual (as well as other) targets; its functions 
are considered in Chapter 20. 
The types of visual information required to perform the 
functions of these different retinal targets are quite varied. 
Reading the text on this page, for example, requires a high- 
resolution sampling of the retinal image, whereas regulat- 
ing circadian rhythms and adjusting the pupil accordingly 
require only a measure of the overall changes in light levels, 
and little or no information about the features of the im- 
age. It should come as no surprise, then, that a diversity of 
ganglion cell types provide information appropriate to the 
functions of these different targets. 
Projections to the lateral geniculate nucleus (described 
in more detail later in this chapter) arise from at least three 
broad classes of ganglion cells, whose visual response prop- 
erties are appropriate for mediating the richness of visual 
perception (high acuity, color, motion). In contrast, projec- 
tions to the hypothalamus and the pretectum arise from 
ganglion cells that lack these properties and are highly

suited for detecting luminance flux. The retinal specializa- 
tions responsible for constructing these distinct classes of 
retinal ganglion cells are only beginning to be identified; 
they include not only differences in ganglion cell synap- 
tic connections, but in the locus of the phototransduction 
event itself. Unlike the majority of ganglion cells, which 
depend on rods and cones for their sensitivity to light, the 
ganglion cells that project to the hypothalamus and pretec- 
tum express their own light-sensitive photopigment (mela- 
nopsin) and are capable of modulating their response to 
changes in light levels in the absence of signals from rods 
and cones. The presence of light sensitivity within this class 
of ganglion cells presumably explains why normal circadian 
rhythms are maintained in animals that have completely 
lost form vision as a result of degeneration of rod and cone 
photoreceptors. 
The Retinotopic Representation of 
the Visual Field 
The spatial relationships among the ganglion cells in the 
retina are maintained in most of their central targets as or- 
derly representations, or "maps," of visual space. Most of 
these structures receive information from both eyes, requir- 
ing that these inputs be integrated to form a coherent map 
of individual points in space. As a general rule, information 
from the left half of the visual world, whether it originates 
from the left or right eye, is represented in the right half of 
the brain, and vice versa. 
Understanding the neural basis for the appropriate ar- 
rangement of inputs from the two eyes requires consider- 
ing how images are projected onto the two retinas, and the 
central destination of the ganglion cells located in different

parts of the retina. Each eye sees a part of visual space that 
defines its visual field (Figure 12.3A). For descriptive pur- 
poses, each retina and its corresponding visual field are di- 
vided into quadrants. In this scheme, vertical and horizontal 
lines that intersect at the center of the fovea subdivide the 
surface of the retina (Figure 12.3B). The vertical line divides 
the retina into nasal and temporal divisions, and the hor- 
izontal line divides the retina into superior and inferior 
divisions. Corresponding vertical and horizontal lines in 
visual space (also called meridians) intersect at the point of 
fixation (the point in visual space that falls on the fovea) 
and define the quadrants of the visual field. The crossing of

light rays diverging from different points on an object at the 
pupil causes the images of objects in the visual field to be 
inverted and left-right reversed on the retinal surface. As a 
result, objects in the temporal part of the visual field are seen 
by the nasal part of the retina, and objects in the superior 
part of the visual field are seen by the inferior part of the 
retina. (It may help in understanding Figure 12.3B to imag- 
ine that you are looking at the back surfaces of the retinas, 
with the corresponding visual fields projected onto them.) 
With both eyes open, the two foveas normally align on 
a single target in visual space, causing the visual fields of 
both eyes to overlap extensively (see Figures 12.3B and 
12.4). This binocular field consists of two symmetrical vi- 
sual hemifields (left and right). The left binocular hemifield 
includes the nasal visual field of the right eye and the tem- 
poral visual field of the left eye; the right hemifield includes 
the temporal visual field of the right eye and the nasal visual 
field of the left eye. The temporal visual fields are more 
extensive than the nasal visual fields, reflecting the sizes 
of the nasal and temporal retinas, respectively. As a result, 
vision in the periphery of the field of view is strictly mon- 
ocular, mediated by the most medial portion of the nasal 
retina. Most of the rest of the field of view can be seen by 
both eyes; i.e., individual points in visual space lie in the 
nasal visual field of one eye and the temporal visual field of 
the other. It is worth noting, however, that the shape of the 
face and nose impact the extent of this region of binocular 
vision. In particular, the inferior nasal visual fields are less 
extensive than the superior nasal fields, and consequently 
the binocular field of view is smaller in the lower visual field 
than in the upper (see Figure 12.3B). 
Ganglion cells that lie in the nasal division of each ret- 
ina give rise to axons that cross in the optic chiasm, while 
those that lie in the temporal retina give rise to axons that 
remain on the same side (see Figure 12.4). The boundary, 
or line of decussation, between contralaterally and ipsilat- 
erally projecting ganglion cells runs through the center of 
the fovea and defines the border between the nasal and 
temporal hemiretinas. Images of objects in the left visual 
hemifield (such as point B in Figure 12.4) fall on the nasal

retina of the left eye and the temporal retina of the right eye, 
and the axons from ganglion cells in these regions of the 
two retinas project through the right optic tract. Objects in 
the right visual hemifield (such as point C in Figure 12.4) 
fall on the nasal retina of the right eye and the temporal 
retina of the left eye; the axons from ganglion cells in these 
regions project through the left optic tract. 
As mentioned 
previously, objects in the monocular portions of the visual 
hemifields (points A and D in Figure 12.4) are seen only 
by the most peripheral nasal retina of each eye; the axons 
of ganglion cells in these regions (like the rest of the nasal 
retina) run in the contralateral optic tract. Thus, unlike the 
optic nerve, the optic tract contains the axons of ganglion 
cells that originate in both eyes and represent the contra- 
lateral field of view. 
Optic tract axons terminate in an orderly fashion within 
their target structures, thus generating well-ordered maps 
of the contralateral hemifield. For the primary visual path- 
way, the map of the contralateral hemifield established in 
the lateral geniculate nucleus is maintained in the projec- 
tions of the lateral geniculate nucleus to the striate cortex

Binocular vision. The diagram illustrates the

its relation to the crossing of fibers in the optic chiasm. Points in 
the binocular portion of the left visual field (B) fall on the nasal 
retina of the left eye and the temporal retina of the right eye. 
Points in the binocular portion of the right visual field (C) fall on 
the nasal retina of the right eye and the temporal retina of the 
left eye. Points that lie in the monocular portions of the left and 
right visual fields (A and D) fall on the left and right nasal retinas, 
respectively. The axons of ganglion cells in the nasal retina cross 
in the optic chiasm, whereas those from the temporal retina do 
not. As a result, the right optic tract carries information from the 
left visual field, and the left optic tract carries information from 
the right visual field. 
(Figure 12.5). Thus, the fovea is represented in the poste- 
rior part of the striate cortex, whereas the more peripheral 
regions of the retina are represented in progressively more 
anterior parts of the striate cortex. The upper visual field is 
mapped below the calcarine sulcus, and the lower visual 
field is mapped above it. As in the somatic sensory system, 
the amount of cortical area devoted to each unit area of 
the sensory surface is not uniform, but reflects the density 
of receptors and sensory axons that supply the peripheral 
region. Like the representation of the hand region in the 
somatic sensory cortex, the representation of the macula is 
therefore disproportionately large, occupying most of the 
caudal pole of the occipital lobe. 
Visual Field Deficits 
A variety of retinal or more central pathologies that involve 
the primary visual pathway can cause visual field deficits 
that are limited to particular regions of visual space. Be- 
cause the spatial relationships in the retinas are maintained 
in central visual structures, a careful analysis of the visual 
fields can often indicate the site of neurological damage. 
Relatively large visual field deficits are called anopsias; 
smaller ones are called scotomas. The former term is com- 
bined with various prefixes to indicate the specific region of 
the visual field from which sight has been lost. 
Damage to the retina or to one of the optic nerves before 
it reaches the optic chiasm results in a loss of vision that is 
limited to the eye of origin (Figure 12.6A). In contrast, dam- 
age in the region of the chiasm-—or more centrally—results 
in specific types of deficits that involve the visual fields of 
both eyes (Figure 12.6B—E). Damage to structures that are 
central to the optic chiasm, including the optic tract, lateral 
geniculate nucleus, optic radiation, and visual cortex, re- 
sults in deficits that are limited to the contralateral visual 
hemifield. For example, interruption of the optic tract on 
the right (Figure 12.6C) results in a loss of sight in the left 
visual field (i.e., blindness in the temporal visual field of the 
left eye and the nasal visual field of the right eye). Because

such damage affects corresponding parts of the visual field 
in each eye, there is a complete loss of vision in the af- 
fected region of the binocular visual field, and the deficit is 
referred to as a homonymous hemianopsia (in this case, 
a left homonymous hemianopsia). 
In contrast, damage to the optic chiasm results in visual 
field deficits that involve non-corresponding parts of the 
visual field of each eye. For example, damage to the middle 
portion of the optic chiasm (often the result of pituitary tu- 
mors) can affect the fibers that cross from the nasal retina 
of each eye, leaving the uncrossed fibers from the temporal 
retinas intact. The resulting loss of vision, confined to the 
temporal visual field of each eye, is known as bitemporal 
hemianopsia (see Figure 12.6B). It is also called heterono- 
mous hemianopsia to emphasize that the parts of the vi- 
sual field that are lost in each eye do not overlap. Individu- 
als with this condition are able to see in both left and right 
visual fields, provided both eyes are open. However, all 
information from the most peripheral parts of visual fields 
(which are seen only by the nasal retinas) is lost. 
Damage to central visual structures is rarely complete. As 
a result, the deficits associated with damage to the chiasm, 
optic tract, optic radiation, or visual cortex are typically more 
limited than those shown in Figure 12.6. This is especially 
true for damage along the optic radiation, which fans out 
under the temporal and parietal lobes in its course from the 
lateral geniculate nucleus to the striate cortex. Some of the 
optic radiation axons run out into the temporal lobe on their 
route to the striate cortex, a branch called Meyer's loop (Fig- 
ure 12.7). Meyer's loop carries information from the superior 
portion of the contralateral visual field. More medial parts 
of the optic radiation, which pass under the cortex of the 
parietal lobe, carry information from the inferior portion of 
the contralateral visual field. Damage to parts of the tem- 
poral lobe with involvement of Meyer's loop can thus result 
in a superior homonymous quadrantanopsia (see Figure 
12.6D); damage to the optic radiation underlying the parietal 
cortex results in an inferior homonymous quadrantanopsia.

of the visual field travel in the parietal 
lobe.

Injury to central visual structures can also lead toa 
phenomenon called macular sparing: the loss of vision 
throughout wide areas of the visual field, with the excep- 
tion of foveal vision (see Figure 12.6E). Macular sparing is 
commonly found with damage to the cortex, but it can be 
a feature of damage anywhere along the length of the vi- 
sual pathway. Although several explanations for macular 
sparing have been offered, including overlap in the pattern 
of crossed and uncrossed ganglion cells supplying central 
vision, the basis for this selective preservation is not clear. 
Spatiotemporal Tuning Properties of 
Neurons in Primary Visual Cortex 
Much of our current understanding of the functional or- 
ganization of visual cortex had its origin in the pioneering 
studies of David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, who used mi- 
croelectrode recordings in anesthetized animals to examine 
the responses of individual neurons in the lateral geniculate 
nucleus and the cortex to various patterns of retinal stimula- 
tion (Figure 12.8A). The responses of neurons in the lateral 
geniculate nucleus were found to be remarkably similar to 
those in the retina, with a center-surround receptive field 
organization and selectivity for luminance increases or de- 
creases. However, the small spots of light that were so effec- 
tive at stimulating neurons in the retina and lateral genicu- 
late nucleus were largely ineffective in visual cortex. Instead, 
most cortical neurons in cats and monkeys responded vigor- 
ously to light-dark bars or edges, and only if the bars were 
presented at a particular range of orientations within the 
cell's receptive field (Figure 12.8B). The responses of cortical 
neurons are thus tuned to the orientation of edges, much 
as cone receptors are tuned to the wavelength of light; the 
peak in the tuning curve (the orientation to which a cell is 
most responsive) is referred to as the neuron's preferred 
orientation (Figure 12.8C). By sampling the responses of a 
large number of single cells, Hubel and Wiesel demonstrated 
that all edge orientations were roughly equally represented in

visual cortex. As a result, a given orientation in a visual scene 
appears to be "encoded" in the activity of a distinct popula- 
tion of orientation-selective neurons. 
To appreciate how the properties of an image might be 
represented by populations of neurons that are tuned to 
different orientations, an image can be decomposed into its 
frequency components (an analytical approach discovered 
by the French mathematician Joseph Fourier) and then fil- 
tered to create a set of images whose spectral composition 
simulate the information that would be conveyed by neu- 
rons tuned to different orientations (Figure 12.9). Each class 
of orientation-selective neuron transmits only a fraction of 
FIGURE 12.9 
Representation of a visual 
image by neurons selective for differ- 
ent stimulus orientations. This simulation 
uses image mathematics (selective filtering of 
the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the 
image) to illustrate the attributes of a visual 
image (greyhound and fence) that would be 
represented in the responses of populations 
of cortical neurons tuned to different pre- 
ferred orientations. The panels surrounding 
the image illustrate the components of the 
image that would be detected by neurons 
tuned to vertical, horizontal, and oblique ori- 
entations (blue boxes). In ways that are still 
not understood, the activity in these different 
populations of neurons is integrated

the information in the scene—the part that matches its filter 
properties—but the information from these different filters 
contains all the spatial information necessary to generate a 
faithful representation of the original image. 
Orientation preference is only one of 
the qualities that 
define the filter properties of neurons in primary visual cor- 
tex. A substantial fraction of cortical neurons are also tuned 
to the direction of stimulus motion, for example, respond- 
ing much more vigorously when a stimulus moves to the 
right than when it moves to the left. Neurons can also be 
characterized by their preference for spatial frequency (the 
coarseness or fineness of the variations in contrast that fall 
within their receptive fields) as well as temporal frequency 
(rate of change in contrast). Why should cortical neurons 
show selectivity for these particular stimulus dimensions? 
Computational analyses suggest that receptive fields with 
properties such as these are well matched to the statistical 
structure of natural scenes and serve as the basis for an ef- 
ficient neural code that maximizes the amount of informa- 
tion encoded with a minimum of redundancy. 
Primary Visual Cortex Architecture 
Like all neocortex, visual cortex is a sheet of neurons ap- 
proximately 2 millimeters thick that exhibits a conspicu- 
ous laminar structure in preparations stained to reveal the 
density and size of neuronal cell bodies (see Chapter 26 
for general overview of cortical structure and cell types). 
By convention, neocortex is divided into six cellular layers 
(layers 1-6; Figure 12.10A). To accommodate the laminar 
complexity exhibited by primate visual cortex, the layers can

Although the organization of intracortical circuits is com- 
plex and not fully understood, it is useful for didactic pur- 
poses to outline the basic input-output organization of visual 
cortex (Figure 12.10B). Lateral geniculate axons terminate 
primarily in cortical layer 4C, which is composed of a class of 
neuron (spiny stellate) whose axons convey the activity sup- 
plied by the lateral geniculate nucleus to other cortical layers. 
FIGURE 12.10 
Organization of primary visual (striate) 
cortex. Striate cortex is divided into six principal cellular layers 
that differ in cell packing density, cellular morphology, and con- 
nections. (A) Primary visual cortex visualized using a histological 
stain that reveals neuronal cell bodies. In primates, layer 4 has 
several subdivisions (4A, 4B, and 4C; see also Figure 12.5). (B) 
Pyramidal cells with prominent apical and basilar dendrites are 
the most numerous cell type in the neocortex; they are located 
in all layers except 4C. Layer 4C is dominated by spiny stellate 
neurons, whose dendrites are confined to this layer. (C) Laminar 
organization of inputs from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). 
Lateral geniculate axons terminate most heavily in layers 4C 
and 4A, with less dense projections to layers 1, 2/3, and 6; the 
terminations in layer 2/3 are "patchy." (D) Laminar organization 
of major intracortical connections. Neurons in layer 4C give rise 
to axons that terminate in more superficial layers (4B and 2/3). 
Axons of layer 2/3 neurons terminate heavily in layer 5. Axons

CHAPTER 12 
Pyramidal neurons (named for the cone shape of their cell 
bodies) in the superficial layers of visual cortex are the source 
of projections to extrastriate cortical areas, while those in the 
deeper cortical layers send their axons to subcortical targets, 
including the lateral geniculate nucleus and the superior col- 
liculus. Thus, the laminar organization of visual cortex, like 
that of other cortical areas, serves to segregate populations of 
neurons having distinct patterns of connections. 
What cannot be discerned from a cursory examination of 
anatomical sections is that the cortex also exhibits a strik- 
ing degree of organization in the radial dimension. Micro- 
electrode penetrations perpendicular to the cortical surface 
encounter columns of neurons that have similar receptive 
field properties, responding, for example, to stimulation 
arising from the same region of visual space and exhibiting 
preferences for similar stimulus properties, such as edge 
orientation and direction of motion (Figure 12.11). The 
uniformity in response along the radial axis raises the ob- 
vious question of how response properties change across 
adjacent columns. From the previous description of the 
mapping of visual space in primary visual cortex, it should 
come as no surprise that adjacent columns have similar but 
slightly shifted receptive field locations, such that tangen- 
tial electrode penetrations encounter columns of neurons 
whose receptive field locations overlap significantly, but

shift progressively in a fashion that is consistent with the 
global mapping of visual space. 
Like receptive field location, the orientation tuning 
curves of neurons in adjacent columns also overlap sig- 
nificantly, but tangential penetrations frequently reveal an 
orderly progression in orientation preference (see Figure 
FIGURE 12.11 
Orderly progression of columnar response 
properties forms the basis of functional maps in primary 
visual cortex. (A) Neurons displaced along the radial axis of the 
cortex have receptive fields that are centered on the same region 
of visual space and exhibit similar orientation preferences. At left

ry visual cortex. Neuronal receptive fields encountered along the 
electrode track are located in the upper part of the right visual 
field (central panel, top; intersection of axes represents center

receptive field centers (central panel, bottom). The orientation 
tuning curves (right panel, top) and preferred orientation (right

track show that there is little variation in the orientation prefer- 
ence of the neurons. (B) Neurons displaced along the tangential

12.11B). The availability of functional imaging techniques 
has made it possible to visualize the two-dimensional layout 
of the map of orientation preference on the surface of visual 
cortex (Figure 12.12). Much of the map of orientation pref- 
erence exhibits smooth progressive change, like that seen 
for the mapping of visual space. This smooth progression 
is interrupted periodically by point discontinuities, where 
neurons with disparate orientation preferences lie close 
to each other in a pattern resembling a child's pinwheel. 
The full range of orientation preferences (0-180 degrees) 
is replicated many times such that neurons with the same 
orientation preference are arrayed in an iterated fashion, 
repeating at approximately 1-millimeter intervals across the 
primary visual cortex. This iteration ensures that the full 
range of orientation values are represented for each region 
of visual space—that is, there are no "holes" in the capac- 
ity to perceive all stimulus orientations. Thus, each point in 
visual space lies in the receptive fields of a large population 
of neurons that collectively occupy several millimeters of 
cortical surface area, an-area that contains neurons having 
the full range of orientation preferences. As described in 
Box 9B, a number of other cortical regions show a similar 
columnar arrangement of their processing 
circuitry. 
Combining Inputs from Two Eyes 
Unlike neurons at earlier stages in the primary visual path- 
way, most neurons in striate cortex are binocular, respond- 
ing to stimulation of both the left and right eyes. Inputs 
from both eyes are present at the level of the lateral genicu- 
late nucleus, but contralateral and ipsilateral retinal axons 
terminate in separate layers, so that individual geniculate 
neurons are strictly monocular, driven by either the left or 
right eye, but not by both (Figure 12.13A-C). Activity aris- 
ing from the left and right eyes that is conveyed by genicu- 
late axons continues to be segregated at the earliest stages

of cortical processing as the axons of geniculate neurons 
terminate in alternating eye-specific ocular dominance 
columns within cortical layer 4 (Figure 12.13D). Beyond 
this point, however, signals from the two eyes converge 
as the axons from layer 4 neurons in adjacent monocular 
stripes synapse on individual neurons in other cortical lay- 
ers. While most neurons outside of layer 4 are binocular, 
the relative strength of the inputs from the two eyes varies 
from neuron to neuron in a columnar fashion that reflects 
the pattern of ocular dominance stripes in layer 4. Thus, 
neurons that are located over the centers of layer 4 ocu- 
lar dominance columns respond almost exclusively to the 
left or right eye, while those that lie over the borders be- 
tween ocular dominance columns in layer 4 respond equally 
well to stimulation of either eye. Similar to the mapping 
of orientation preference, tangential electrode penetrations 
across the superficial layers reveal a gradual, continuous 
shift in the ocular dominance of the recorded neurons (see 
Figure 12.13B,C). With the exception of layer 4, which is 
strictly monocular, vertical penetrations encounter neurons 
with similar ocular preferences. 
Bringing together the inputs from the two eyes at the 
level of the striate cortex provides a basis for stereopsis, the 
sensation of depth that arises from viewing nearby objects 
with two eyes instead of one. Because the two eyes look at 
the world from slightly different angles, objects that lie in 
front of or behind the plane of fixation project to non-cor- 
responding points on the two retinas. To convince yourself 
of this fact, hold your hand at arm's length and fixate on 
the tip of one finger. Maintain fixation on the finger as you 
hold a pencil in your other hand about half an arm's length

Mixing of the pathways from the two eyes 
first occurs in the striate cortex. (A) Although the lateral 
geniculate nucleus receives inputs from both eyes, the inputs 
are segregated in separate layers. (B) In many species, including 
most primates, inputs from the two eyes remain segregated in 
the ocular dominance columns of layer 4. Layer 4 neurons send 
their axons to other cortical layers; it is at this stage that the 
information from the two eyes converges onto individual neu- 
rons. (BC) Physiological demonstration of columnar organization 
of ocular dominance in primary visual cortex. Cortical neurons 
vary in the strength of their response to the inputs from the two 
eyes, from complete domination by one eye to equal influence 
of the two eyes. Neurons encountered in a vertical electrode 
penetration (other than those neurons that lie in layer 4) tend to 
have similar ocular dominance. Tangential electrode penetration 
across the superficial cortical layers reveals a gradual shift in the 
strength of response to the inputs from the two eyes, from com- 
plete domination by one eye to equal influence of the two eyes. 
(D) Pattern of ocular dominance columns in human striate cortex. 
The alternating left and right eye columns in layer 4 have been 
reconstructed from tissue sections and projected onto a pho- 
tograph of the medial wall of the occipital lobe. (D from Horton 
and Hedley-Whyte, 1984.)

away from you. At this distance, the image of the pencil 
falls on non-corresponding points on the two retinas and 
will therefore be perceived as two separate pencils (a phe- 
nomenon called double vision, or diplopia). if you move 
the pencil toward the finger (the point of fixation), the two 
images of the pencil fuse and you see a single pencil in front 
of the finger. Thus, for a small distance on either side of the 
plane of fixation, where the disparity between the two views 
of the world remains modest, a single image is perceived; 
the disparity between the two eye views of objects nearer 
or farther than the point of fixation is interpreted as depth 
(Figure 12.14). While disparity cues normally arise from ob- 
jects in the visual scene, disparity cues alone are powerful 
enough to give rise to the appearance of objects that cannot 
be seen by monocular viewing (Box 12A). 
Some binocular neurons in the striate cortex and in 
other visual cortical areas have receptive field properties 
that make them good candidates for extracting information 
about binocular disparity. In these neurons, the receptive 
fields driven by the left and right eyes are slightly offset 
either in their position in visual space or in their internal or- 
ganization so that the cell is maximally activated by stimuli 
that fall on non-corresponding parts of the retinas. Some 
of these neurons (so-called far cells) discharge to retinal 
disparities that arise from points beyond the plane of fixa- 
tion, while others (near cells) respond to retinal disparities 
that arise from points in front of the plane of fixation. A 
third class of neurons (tuned zero) respond selectively to 
points that lie on the plane of fixation. The relative activity 
in these different classes of neurons is thought to mediate 
sensations of stereoscopic depth. 

FIGURE 12.14 
Binocular disparities are thought 
to be the basis of stereopsis. When the eyes are 
fixated on point b, points that lie beyond the plane 
of fixation (point c) or in front of the point of fixa- 
tion (point a) project to non-corresponding points on 
the two retinas. When these disparities are small, the 
images are fused, and the brain interprets the dispar- 
ity as small differences in depth. When the disparities 
are greater, double vision occurs (although this normal 
phenomenon is generally unnoticed).

Interestingly, the presence of binocular re- 
sponses in cortical neurons is contingent on 
normal patterns of activity from the two eyes 
during early postnatal life. Any factor that cre- 
ates an imbalance in the activity of the two 
eyes—for example, the clouding of one lens or 
the abnormal alignment of the eyes during in- 
fancy (strabismus)—can permanently reduce the 
effectiveness of one eye in driving cortical neu- 
rons, thus impairing the ability to use binocular 
information as a cue for depth. Early detection 
and correction of visual problems is therefore 
essential for normal visual function in maturity.

In addition to being specific for input from 
one eye or the other, the layers in the lateral 
geniculate are also distinguished on the ba- 
sis of cell size. Two ventral layers, which are 
composed of large neurons, are referred to 
as the magnocellular layers; the more dor- 
sal layers, composed of small neurons, are 
referred to as the parvocellular layers. The 
magno- and parvocellular layers receive inputs 
from distinct populations of ganglion cells that 
exhibit corresponding differences in cell size. 
M ganglion cells that terminate in the mag- 
nocellular layers have larger cell bodies, more 
extensive dendritic fields, and larger-diameter 
axons than the P ganglion cells that terminate 
in the parvocellular layers (Figure 12.15A,B).

CHAPTER 12 
An important advance in studies of 
_ stereopsis occurred in 1959 when 
_ Bela Julesz, then working at the Bell 
_ Laboratories in Murray Hill, New 
_ Jersey, discovered an ingenious way of 
_ showing that stereoscopy depends on 
| matching information seen by the two 
_ eyes without any prior recognition of 
what object(s) such matching might 
_ generate. Julesz, a Hungarian whose 
background was in engineering and 
_ physics, was working on the problem 
of how to "break" camouflage. He sur- 
mised that the brain's ability to fuse the 
slightly different views of the two eyes 
to bring out new information would 
be an aid in overcoming military cam- 
ouflage. Julesz also realized that, if his 
hypothesis was correct, a hidden figure 
in a random pattern presented to the 
two eyes should emerge when a portion 
of the otherwise identical pattern was 
shifted horizontally in the view of one 
eye or the other. A horizontal shift in 
one direction would cause the hidden 
object to appear in front of the plane 
of the background, whereas a shift in 
the other direction would cause the 
hidden object to appear in back of the 
plane. Such a figure, called a random 
dot stereogram, and the method of its 
creation are shown in Figures A and 
B. The two images can be easily fused 
in a stereoscope (such as the familiar 
ViewMaster® toy), but can also be fused 
simply by allowing the eyes to diverge. 
Most people find it easiest to do this 
Random dot stereograms. (A) First, a 
random dot pattern, to be observed by 
one eye, is created. The stimulus for the 
other eye is then created by copying the 
first image, displacing a particular region 
horizontally, and then filling in the gap 
with a random sample of dots. (B) When 
the right and left images are viewed 
simultaneously but independently by the 
two eyes (either by using a stereoscope 
or by fusing the images by converging 
or diverging the eyes), the plane of the 
shifted region (a square) appears to be 
different from the plane of the other dots.

make sense of what it is presented with,

figure appears (in this case, a square

figure). The random dot stereogram 
has been widely used in stereoscopic 
research for about 40 years, although 
how such stimuli elicit depth remains 
very much a matter of dispute. 
An impressive—and extraordinarily 
popular—derivative of the random 
dot stereogram is the autostereogram 
(Figure C). The nineteenth-century 
British physicist David Brewster was the 
first to discern the possibility of autoste- 
reograms. While staring at a Victorian 
wallpaper with an iterated but offset pat- 
tern, he noticed that when the patterns 
(A) 
were fused he perceived two different 
planes. The plethora of autostereograms 
that can be seen today in posters, books, 
and newspapers are close cousins of the 
random dot stereogram in that comput- 
ers are used to shift patterns of iterated 
information with respect to each other. 
The result is that different planes emerge 
from what appears to be a meaningless 
array of visual information (or, depend- 
ing on the taste of the creator, an appar- 
ently "normal" scene in which the iterat- 
ed and displaced information is hidden). 
Some autostereograms are designed to 
reveal the hidden figure when the eyes 
diverge, others when the eyes converge. 
(Looking at a plane more distant than 
the plane of the surface causes diver- 
gence; looking at a plane in front of the 
picture causes the eyes to converge; see 
Figure 12.14.) 
(Continued on next page) 
Binocular fusion pro- 
duces sensation that the 
shifted square is in front 
of the background plane. 

BOX 12A (continued) 
The elevation of the autostereogram 
to a popular art form should prob- 
ably be attributed to Chris W. Tyler, 
a student of Julesz's and a visual psy- 
chophysicist, who was among the first 
to create commercial autostereograms. 
Numerous graphic artists—preemi- 
nently in Japan, where the popularity 
of the autostereogram has been enor- 
mous—have generated many of such 
images. As with the random dot stereo- 
gram, the task in viewing the autoste- 
reogram is not clear to the observer. 
Nonetheless, the hidden figure 
emerges, often after minutes of effort in 
which the brain automatically tries to 
_ make sense of the occult information.

Moreover, the axons of relay cells in the magno- and par- 
vocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus termi- 
nate on distinct populations of neurons located in separate 
strata within layer 4C of primary visual cortex: magnocel- 
lular axons terminate in the upper part of layer 4C (4Ca), 
while parvocellular axons terminate in the lower part of 
layer 4C (4C§8) (Figure 12.15C). Thus, the retinogeniculate 
pathway is composed of parallel magnocellular and parvo- 
cellular pathways that convey distinct types of information 
to the initial stages of cortical processing. 
The response properties of the M and P ganglion cells 
provide important clues about the contributions of the 
maegno- and parvocellular pathways to visual perception. 
M ganglion cells have larger receptive fields than P cells, 
and their axons have faster conduction velocities. M and P 
ganglion cells also differ in ways that are not so obviously 
related to their morphology. M cells respond transiently to 
the presentation of visual stimuli, while P cells respond in a 
sustained fashion. Moreover, P ganglion cells can transmit 
information about color, whereas M cells cannot. P cells 
convey color information because their receptive field cen- 
ters and surrounds are driven by different classes of cones 
(i.e., cones responding with greatest sensitivity to either 
short-, medium-, or long-wavelength light). For example, 
CENTRAL VISUAL PATHWAYS

some P ganglion cells have centers that receive inputs from 
long-wavelength-sensitive cones and surrounds that re- 
ceive inputs from medium-wavelength-sensitive cones. 
Others have centers that receive inputs from medium 
wavelength-sensitive cones and surrounds from long- 
wavelength-sensitive cones (see Chapter 11). As a result, P 
cells are sensitive to differences in the wavelengths of light 
striking their receptive field center and surround. Although 
M ganglion cells also receive inputs from cones, there is no 
difference in the type of cone input to the receptive field 
center and surround; the center and surround of each M 
cell receptive field is driven by all cone types. The absence 
of cone specificity to center-surround antagonism makes M 
cells largely insensitive to differences in the wavelengths of 
light that strike their receptive.field centers and surrounds, 
and they are thus unable to transmit color information to 
their central targets. 
The contribution of the magno- and parvocellular path- 
ways to visual perception has been tested experimentally 
by examining the visual capabilities of monkeys after selec- 
tively damaging either the magno- or parvocellular layers 
of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Damage to the magnocel- 
lular layers has little effect on visual acuity or color vision 
but sharply reduces the ability to perceive rapidly changing 

272 
CHAPTER 12 
stimuli. In contrast, damage to the parvocellular layers has 
no effect on motion perception but severely impairs visual 
acuity and color perception. These observations suggest 
that the visual information conveyed by the parvocellular 
pathway is particularly important for high spatial resolu- 
tion—the detailed analysis of the shape, size, and color of 
an object. The magnocellular pathway, on the other hand, 
appears critical for tasks that require high temporal resolu- 
tion, such as evaluating the location, speed, and direction 
of a rapidly moving object. 
In addition to the magno- and parvocellular pathways, 
a third distinct anatomical pathway—the koniocellular, 
or K-cell pathway—has been identified within the lateral 
geniculate nucleus (see Figure 12.15). Neurons contributing 
to the K-cell pathway reside in the interlaminar zones that 
separate lateral geniculate layers; these neurons receive in- 
puts from fine-caliber retinal axons and project in a patchy 
fashion to the superficial layers (layers 2 and 3) of primary 
visual cortex. Although the contribution of the K-cell path- 
way to perception is not understood, it appears that some 
aspects of color vision, especially information derived from 
short-wavelength-sensitive cones, may be transmitted via 
the K-cell rather than the P-cell pathway. Why short-wave- 
length-sensitive cone signals should be processed differently 
from middle- and long-wavelength information is not clear, 
but the distinction may reflect the earlier evolutionary origin 
of the K-cell pathway (see Chapter 11).

The Functional Organization 
of Extrastriate Visual Areas 
Anatomical and electrophysiological studies in monkeys 
have led to the discovery of a multitude of areas in the oc- 
cipital, parietal, and temporal lobes that are involved in 
processing visual information (Figure 12.16). Each of these 
areas contains a map of visual space, and each is largely de- 
pendent on the primary visual cortex for its activation. The 
response properties of the neurons in some of these regions 
suggest that they are specialized for different aspects of the 
visual scene. For example, the middle temporal area (MT) 
contains neurons that respond selectively to the direction 
of a moving edge without regard to its color. In contrast, 
area V4 contains a high percentage of neurons that respond 
selectively to the color of a visual stimulus without regard 
FIGURE 12.16 
Subdivisions of the extrastriate cortex in 
the macaque monkey. (A) Each of the subdivisions indicated in 
color contains neurons that respond to visual stimulation. Many 
are buried in sulci, and the overlying cortex must be removed 
in order to expose them. Some of the more extensively studied 
extrastriate areas are specifically identified (V2, V3, V4, and MT). 
V1 is the primary visual cortex; MT is the middle temporal area. 
(B) The arrangement of extrastriate and other areas of neocortex 
in a flattened view of the monkey neocortex. At least 25 areas are 
predominantly or exclusively visual in function, and 7 additional 
areas are suspected to play a role in visual processing. (A after

1991.)

to its direction of movement. These physiological findings 
are supported by behavioral evidence; thus, damage to area 
MT leads to a specific impairment in a monkey's ability to 
perceive the direction of motion in a stimulus pattern, while 
other aspects of visual perception remain intact. 
Functional imaging studies have indicated a similar ar- 
rangement of visual areas within human extrastriate cortex. 
Using retinotopically restricted stimuli, it has been possible 
to localize at least ten separate representations of the vi- 
sual field (Figure 12.17). One of these areas exhibits a large 
motion-selective signal, suggesting that itis the homologue 
of the motion-selective middle temporal area described in 
monkeys. Another area exhibits color-selective responses, 
suggesting that it may be similar to V4 in non-human pri- 
mates. A role for these areas in the perception of motion 
and color, respectively, is further supported by evidence for 
increases in activity not only during the presentation of the 
relevant stimulus, but also during periods when subjects 
experience motion or color afterimages. 
The clinical description of selective visual deficits after lo- 
calized damage to various regions of extrastriate cortex also 
supports functional specialization of extrastriate visual areas 
in humans. For example, a well-studied patient who suffered 
a stroke that damaged the extrastriate region thought to be

Dark grey areas correspond to cortical regions that were buried 
in sulci; light regions correspond to regions that were located on 
the surface of gyri. Visual areas in humans show a close resem- 
blance to visual areas originally defined in monkeys (compare 
with Figure 12.16). (After Sereno et al., 1995.) 
comparable to area MT in the monkey was unable to ap- 
preciate the motion of objects, a rare disorder called cere- 
bral akinetopsia. The neurologist who treated her noted 
that she had difficulty in pouring tea into a cup because the 
fluid seemed to be "frozen." In addition, she could not stop 
pouring at the right time because she was unable to perceive 
when the fluid level had risen to the brim. The patient also

had trouble following a dialog because she could not fol- 
low the movements of the speaker's mouth. Crossing the 
street was potentially terrifying because she couldn't judge 
the movement of approaching cars. As the patient related, 
"When I'm looking at the car first, it seems far away. But 
then, when I want to cross the road, suddenly the car is very 
near." Her ability to perceive other features of the visual 
scene, such as color and form, was intact. 
Another example of a specific visual deficit as a result of 
damage to extrastriate cortex is cerebral achromatopsia. 
These patients lose the ability to see the world in color, 
although other aspects of vision remain in good working 
order. The normal colors of a visual scene are described as 
being replaced by "dirty" shades of gray, much like look- 
ing at a poor-quality black-and-white movie. Achroma- 
topsic individuals know the normal colors of objects—that 
a school bus is yellow, an apple red—but can no longer 
see them. When asked to draw objects from memory, they 
have no difficulty with shapes but are unable to appropri- 
ately color the objects they have represented. It is important 
to distinguish this condition from the color blindness that 
arises from the congenital absence of one or more cone pig- 
ments in the retina (see Chapter 11). In achromatopsia, the 
three types of cones are functioning norrnally; it is damage 
to specific extrastriate cortical areas that renders the patient 
unable to use the information supplied by the retina. 
Based on the anatomical connections between visual ar- 
eas, differences in electrophysiological response properties, 
and the effects of cortical lesions, a consensus has emerged 
that extrastriate cortical areas are organized into two largely 
separate systems that eventually feed information into corti- 
cal association areas in the temporal and parietal lobes (see 
Chapter 26). One system, called the ventral stream, includes 
area V4 and leads from the striate cortex into the inferior part 
of the temporal lobe. This system is thought to be respon- 
sible for high-resolution form vision and object recognition. 
The dorsal stream, which includes the middle temporal area, 
leads from striate cortex into the parietal lobe. This system is 
thought to be responsible for spatial aspects of vision, such as 
the analysis of motion, and positional relationships between 
objects in the visual scene (Figure 12.18). 
The functional dichotomy between these two streams 
is supported by observations on the response properties of 
neurons and the effects of selective cortical lesions. Neurons 
in the ventral stream exhibit properties that are important 
for object recognition, such as selectivity for shape, color, 
and texture. At the highest levels in this pathway, neurons 
exhibit even greater selectivity, responding preferentially to 
faces and objects (see Chapter 26). In contrast, those in the 
dorsal stream are not tuned to these properties, but show 
selectivity for direction and speed of movement. Consis- 
tent with this interpretation, lesions of the parietal cortex 
severely impair an animal's ability to distinguish objects on 
the basis of their position, while having little effect on its

Outside the occipital lobe, visual areas are broadly organized into

and a dorsal pathway that leads to the parietal lobe. The ventral

pathway in spatial vision. 
ability to perform object-recognition tasks. In contrast, le- 
sions of the inferotemporal cortex produce profound im- 
pairments in the ability to perform recognition tasks but no 
impairment in spatial tasks. These effects are remarkably 
similar to symptoms found after damage to the parietal and 
temporal lobe in humans (see Chapters 26 and 27). 
What, then, is the relationship between these "higher 
order" extrastriate visual streams and the magno-, parvo-, 
and koniocellular pathways that supply the input to primary 
visual cortex? Despite the initial segregation of magno-, 
parvo-, and koniocellular inputs in primary visual cortex, 
at subsequent stages of processing these inputs at least par- 
tially converge. The extrastriate areas in the ventral stream 
clearly have access to the information conveyed by all three 
pathways, and the dorsal stream, while dominated by in- 
puts from the magnocellular pathway, also receives inputs 
from the parvo- and koniocellular pathways. Even within 
primary visual cortex there is ample evidence for the con- 
vergence of information from these different lateral genicu- 
late pathways. Thus, it would appear that the functions of 
higher visual areas involve the integration of information 
derived from distinct geniculocortical pathways. 
Summary 
Distinct populations of retinal ganglion cells send their ax- 
ons to a number of central visual structures that serve dif- 
ferent functions. The most important projections are to the 
pretectum for mediating the pupillary light reflex; to the 
hypothalamus for the regulation of circadian rhythms; to 
the superior colliculus for the regulation of eye and head 
movements, and—most important of all—to the lateral ge- 
niculate nucleus for mediating vision and visual perception. 

The retinogeniculostriate projection (the primary visual 
pathway) is arranged topographically such that central 
visual structures contain an organized map of the contra- 
lateral visual field. Damage anywhere along the primary 
visual pathway, which includes the optic nerve, optic tract, 
lateral geniculate nucleus, optic radiation, and striate cortex, 
results in a loss of vision confined to a predictable region of 
visual space. Compared to retinal ganglion cells, neurons 
at higher levels of the visual pathway become increasingly 
selective in their stimulus requirements. Thus, most neu- 
rons in the striate cortex respond to light-dark edges only if 
they are presented at a certain orientation, or to movement 
of the edge in a specific direction. The neural circuitry in 
the striate cortex also brings together information from the 
two eyes; most cortical neurons (other than those in layer 
4, which are segregated into eye-specific columns) have 
binocular responses. Binocular convergence is presumably 
essential for the detection of binocular disparity, an impor- 
tant component of depth perception. The primary visual 
pathway is composed of separate functional pathways that 
convey information from different types of retinal ganglion 
cells to the initial stages of cortical processing. The mag- 
nocellular pathway conveys information that is critical for 
the detection of rapidly changing stimuli; the parvocellular 
pathway mediates high-acuity vision and appears to share 
responsibility for color vision with the koniocellular path- 
way. Finally, beyond striate cortex, parcellation of function 
continues in the ventral and dorsal streams that lead to the 
extrastriate and association areas in the temporal and pa- 
rietal lobes, respectively. Areas in the inferotemporal cor- 
tex are especially important in object recognition, whereas 
areas in the parietal lobe are critical for understanding the 
spatial relationships among objects in the visual field.

THE AUDITORY 
SYSTEM 
Overview 
THE AUDITORY SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE engineering masterpieces of the human 
body. At the periphery of the system is an array of miniature acoustical detectors 
packed into a space no larger than a pea. These detectors can transduce vibrations 
as small as the diameter of an atom, and they respond a thousand times faster than 
visual photoreceptors. Such rapid auditory responses to acoustical cues facilitate the 
initial orientation of the head and body to novel stimuli, especially those stimuli that 
are not initially within the field of view. Much less well understood is the central 
auditory system, the auditory cortices in particular. Human social communication is 
largely mediated by the auditory system, making the auditory system at least as criti- 
cal for well being as the visual system; indeed, loss of hearing can be more socially 
debilitating than blindness. From a cultural perspective, the auditory system is es- 
sential not only to understanding speech, but also to hearing music, one of the most 
aesthetically sophisticated forms of human expression. For these and other reasons, 
audition represents a fascinating and especially important mode of sensation. 
Sound 
In physical terms, sound refers to pressure waves generated by vibrating air mol- 
ecules; in more casual usage (and somewhat confusingly), sound refers to an auditory 
percept. Physical sound waves are much like the ripples that radiate outward when 
a rock is thrown into a pool of water. However, instead of spreading across a two- 
dimensional surface, sound waves propagate in three dimensions, creating spherical 
shells of alternating compression and rarefaction. Like all wave phenomena, sound 
waves have four major features: waveform, phase, amplitude (usually expressed in 
logarithmic units known as decibels, abbreviated dB), and frequency (expressed in 
cycles per second or Hertz, abbreviated Hz). For a human listener, the amplitude and 
frequency of a sound pressure change at the ear roughly correspond to that listener's 
experience of loudness and pitch, respectively. 
The waveform of a sound stimulus is its amplitude plotted against time. To un- 
derstand this concept, it helps to begin by visualizing an acoustical waveform as a 
sine wave. Figure 13.1 diagrams the behavior of air molecules near a tuning fork that

A sine wave. Diagram of the periodic condensa-

tines of a tuning fork. The molecular disturbance of the air is

plot of the air pressure versus distance from the fork. Note its

vibrates sinusoidally when struck. The vibrating tines of the 
tuning fork produce local displacements of the surrounding 
molecules, such that when the tine moves in one direction, 
there is molecular condensation; when it moves in the other 
direction, there is rarefaction. These changes in density of 
the air molecules are equivalent to local changes in air pres- 
sure. Such regular, sinusoidal cycles of compression and 
rarefaction can be thought of as a form of circular motion, 
with one complete cycle equivalent to one full revolution 
(360°). This point can be illustrated with two sinusoids of 
the same frequency projected onto a circle, a strategy that 
also makes it easier to understand the concept of phase 
(Figure 13.2). Imagine that two tuning forks, both of which 
resonate at the same frequency, are struck at slightly dif- 
ferent times. At a given time t = 0, one wave is at position 
P and the other at position Q. By projecting P and Q onto 
the circle, their respective phase angles, 8, and 6,, are ap- 
parent. The sine wave that begins at P reaches a particular 
point on the circle, say 180°, at time t,, whereas the wave 
that begins at Q reaches 180° at time t,. Thus, phase differ- 
ences have corresponding time differences, a concept that is 
important in appreciating how the auditory system locates 
sounds in space. 
Although useful in a didactic sense, it must be kept in 
mind that sounds composed of single sine waves (i.e., pure

for example, consist of acoustically complex waveforms, and 
most other natural stimuli (a babbling brook, wind in trees,

and so on) have little or no periodicity. Complex waveforms 
(such as those produced in speech) that have a periodic 
quality can be modeled as the sum of sinusoidal waves of 
varying amplitudes, frequencies, and phases. In engineer- 
ing applications, an algorithm called the Fourier transform 
decomposes a complex signal into its sinusoidal compo- 
nents. In the auditory system, as will be apparent later in 
the chapter, the inner ear acts as a sort of acoustical prism, 
decomposing complex sounds into a myriad of constituent 
frequencies, although precisely how this is related to what 
we hear remains uncertain. 
The human ear is extraordinarily sensitive to sound pres- 
sure. At the threshold of hearing, air molecules are dis- 
placed an average of only 10 picometers (107 m), and the 
intensity of such a sound is about one-trillionth of a watt 
per square meter! Even dangerously high sound pressure 
levels (>100 dB) have power at the eardrum that is only in 
the milliwatt range (Box 13A). 
The Audible Spectrum 
Humans can detect periodic sounds in a frequency range 
from about 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Human infants can actually 
hear frequencies slightly higher than 20 kHz, but they lose 
some high-frequency sensitivity as they mature; the upper 
limit in average adults is closer to 15-17 kHz. Not all mam- 
malian species are sensitive to the same range of frequen- 
cies, and most small mammals are sensitive to very high 
frequencies but not to low frequencies. For instance, some 
species of bats are sensitive to tones as high as 200 kHz, 
but their lower limit is around 20 kHz—the upper limit for 
young people with normal hearing. 
One reason for these differences is that small objects, 
including the auditory structures of these small mammals, 
resonate at high frequencies, whereas large objects tend 
to resonate at low frequencies—which explains why the 
sound of a violin has a higher pitch than the sound of a 

BOX 13A Four Causes of Acquired Hearing Loss 
_ Acquired hearing loss is an increas- 
_ ingly common sensory deficit that can 
_ lead to impaired oral communication 
_ and social isolation. Four major causes 
_ of acquired hearing loss are acoustical 
_ trauma, infection of the inner ear, oto- 
toxic drugs, and presbyacusis (literally, 
_ 
"the hearing of the old"). 
The exquisite sensitivity of the recep- 
tor cells in the auditory periphery, 
_ combined with the direct mechanical 
_ linkage between these receptor cells 
and the acoustical stimulus, make the 
ear especially susceptible to acute or 
chronic acoustical trauma. Extremely 
loud, percussive sounds, such as those 
generated by explosives or gunfire, can 
rupture the eardrum and so severely 
distort the inner ear that the organ of 
Corti is torn. The resultant loss of hear- 
ing is abrupt and often quite severe. 
Less well appreciated is the fact that 
repeated exposure to less dramatic but 
nonetheless loud sounds, including 
those produced by industrial or house- 
hold machinery or by amplified musi- 
cal instruments, can also damage the 
inner ear. Although these sounds leave 
the eardrum intact, specific damage is 
done to the hair bundle: the stereocilia 
of cochlear hair cells of animals exposed 
to loud sounds either shear off at their 
pivot points with the hair cell body, or 
they fuse together in a platelike fashion 
that impedes movement. In humans, the 
mechanical resonance of the ear to stim- 
ulus frequencies centered about 3 kHz 
means that exposure to loud, broadband 
noises (such as those generated by jet 
engines) results in especially pronounced 
deficits near this resonant frequency. 
Ototoxic drugs include aminogly- 
coside antibiotics such as gentamycin 
and kanamycin, which directly affect 
hair cells; and ethacrynic acid, which 
poisons the potassium-extruding cells 
of the stria vascularis. In the absence 
of these K*-pumping cells, the endo- 
cochlear potential, which supplies the 
energy to drive the auditory signal 
transduction process, is lost. Although 
still a matter of some debate, the 
relatively nonselective transduction 
channel apparently affords a means of 
entry for aminoglycoside antibiotics, 
which then poison hair cells by disrupt- 
ing phosphoinositide metabolism. In 
particular, outer hair cells and those 
inner hair cells that transduce high- 
frequency stimuli are more affected, 
simply because of their greater energy 
requirements. 
Finally, presbyacusis, the hearing 
loss associated with aging, may stem in

especially fine microvasculature of the 
inner ear, as well as from genetic pre- 
dispositions to hair-cell damage. Recent 
advances in understanding the genetic 
transmission of acquired hearing loss in 
both humans and mice point to muta- 
tions in myosin isoforms unique to hair 
cells as one likely culprit.

cello. Different animal species tend to emphasize frequency 
bandwidths in both their vocalizations and their range of 
hearing. In general, vocalizations, by virtue of their peri- 
odicity, can be distinguished from the noise "barrier" cre- 
ated by environmental sounds, such as babbling brooks 
and rustling leaves. Animals that echolocate, such as bats 
and dolphins, rely on very high-frequency vocal sounds to 
maximally resolve spatial features of the target, while ani- 
mals intent on avoiding predation have auditory systems 
"tuned" to the low-frequency vibrations that approaching 
predators transmit through the substrate. These behavioral 
differences are mirrored by a wealth of anatomical and 
functional specializations throughout the auditory system. 
A Synopsis of Auditory Function 
The auditory system transforms sound stimuli into dis- 
tinct patterns of neural activity. These patterns are then 
integrated with information from other sensory systems 
to guide behaviors that include orienting to acoustical 
stimuli and engaging in intraspecies communication. The 
first stage of this transformation occurs at the external and 
middle ears, which collect sound waves and amplify their 
pressure so that the sound energy in the air can be suc- 
cessfully transmitted to the fluid-filled cochlea of the inner 
ear. In the inner ear, a series of biomechanical processes 
enable the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the original 
signal to be transduced by the sensory hair cells and en- 
coded by the electrical activity of the auditory nerve fibers. 
One product of this process of acoustical decomposition is 
the systematic representation of sound frequency along the 
length of the cochlea, referred to as tonotopy, which is an 
important organizational feature preserved throughout the 
central auditory pathways. 
The earliest stage of central processing occurs at the co- 
chlear nucleus, where the peripheral auditory information 
diverges into a number of parallel central pathways. Ac- 
cordingly, the output of the cochlear nucleus has several

BOX 13B Music 
| 
_ Even though everyone recognizes music 
_ when they hear it, the concept of music 
_ is a difficult one. The Oxford English 
_ Dictionary defines it as "The art or sci- 
~ ence of combining vocal or instrumen- 
tal sounds with a view toward beauty 
_ or coherence of form and expression 
of emotion." Music obviously entails 
- temporal aspects such as rhythm that 
_ 
are closely tied to motor behavior (think 
_ of foot-tapping and dancing) and emo- 
- tional aspects that are augmented by 
_ 
lyrics and cultural preferences. In terms 
_ of the present chapter, however, music 
_ 
chiefly concerns the aspect of human 
_ audition that is experienced as tones. 
_ The stimuli that give rise to tonal per- 
_ cepts are periodic, meaning that they 
repeat systematically over time, like 
the sine wave in Figure 13.1. However, 
- natural periodic stimuli do not occur 
as sine waves, but rather as complex 
repetitions involving a number of dif- 
ferent frequencies; such stimuli give rise 
to a sense of harmony when sounded 
relatively close together in appropri- 
ate combinations, and they generate 
a sense of melody when they occur 
sequentially. 
Although we usually take for granted 
the way tone-evoking stimuli are heard, 
this aspect of audition presents some 
profound puzzles. The most obvious of 
these is that humans perceive periodic 
stimuli whose fundamental frequen- 
cies have a 2:1 ratio as highly similar, 
and, for the most part, musically inter- 
changeable. These 2:1 intervals are 
called octaves. Thus, in Western musi- 
cal terminology, any two tones related 
by an interval of one or more octaves 
are given the same name (i.e., the notes 
A,B, C, ... G) and are distinguished 
only by a qualifier that denotes their 
relative ordinal position (e.g., C,, C,, 
C,, etc.), A key question, then, is why 
periodic sound stimuli whose funda- 
mental frequencies have a 2:1 ratio are 
perceived as similar. 
A second puzzling feature is that 
most, if not all, musical traditions sub- 
divide octaves into a relatively small set 
of intervals for composition and perfor- 
mance, each interval being defined by 
its relationship to the lowest tone of the 
set. Such sets are called musical scales. 
The scales predominantly employed 
in all cultures over the centuries have 
used some (or occasionally all) of the 
12 tonal intervals that in Western musi- 
cal terminology are referred to as the 
chromatic scale (see figure). But certain 
intervals of the chromatic scale—such 
as the fifth, the fourth, the major third, 
and the major sixth—are used more 
often than others in composition and 
performance. These form the majority 
of the intervals employed in the penta- 
tonic and diatonic major scales, the two 
most frequently used scales in music 
worldwide. Again, there is no prin- 
cipled explanation of these preferences 
among all the possible intervals within 
the octave that humans can discrimi- 
nate (about 240 over an octave in the 
middle range of human hearing). 
Perhaps the most fundamental 
question in music—and arguably the 
"common denominator" of all musical 
tonality—is why certain combinations 
of tones are perceived as relatively con- 
sonant, or "harmonious," and others 
relatively dissonant, or "inharmonious." 
These perceived differences among 
the possible combinations of tones 
making up the chromatic scale are the 
basis for polytonal music in which the 
perception of relative harmony guides 
the composition of chords and melodic 
lines. The more compatible of these 
combinations are typically used to con- 
vey "resolution" at the end of a musical 
phrase or piece, whereas less compat- 
ible combinations are used to indicate 
a transition, a lack of resolution, or to 
introduce a sense of tension in a chord 
or melodic sequence. Like octaves and

targets. One of these is the superior olivary complex, the 
first point at which information from the two ears interacts 
and the site of the initial processing of the cues that allow 
listeners to localize sound in space. The cochlear nucleus 
also projects to the inferior colliculus of the midbrain, a 
major integrative center and the first point at which au- 
ditory information can interact with the motor system. 
The inferior colliculus relays auditory information to the 
thalamus and cortex, where additional integrative aspects 
(such as harmonic and temporal combinations) of sound 
especially germane to speech and music are processed 
(Box 13B). The large number of stations between the au- 
ditory periphery and the cortex far exceeds those in other 
sensory systems, providing a hint that the perception of 
communication and environmental sounds is an especially 
critical and intensive neural process. Furthermore, both 
the peripheral and central auditory systems are "tuned" to 
conspecific communication vocalizations, pointing to the 
interdependent evolution of the entire system for perceiv- 
ing these signals.

ogy remains a mystery. 
izing octaves, scales, and consonance 
have been based on the fact that the 
_ musical intervals corresponding to 
_ octaves, fifths, and fourths (in modern 
_ musical terminology) are produced by 
_ physical sources whose relative propor- 
_ tions (e.g., the relative lengths of two 
_ plucked strings or their fundamental 
frequencies) have ratios of 2:1, 3:2, or 
4:3, respectively; these relationships 
were first described by Pythagoras. This 
coincidence of numerical simplicity and 
_ perceptual effect has been so impres- 
sive over the centuries that attempts to 
rationalize phenomena such as con- 
sonance and scale structure in terms 
of mathematical relationships have 
tended to dominate thinking about 
these issues. This conceptual frame- 
_ work, however, fails to account for 
many perceptual observations, includ- 
ing, most famously, why people hear 
the pitch of the fundamental frequency 
of stimuli comprising only upper har- 
monics (called "hearing the missing 
fundamental") and why, when the 
frequencies of a set of harmonics are 
changed by a constant value such that 
they lack a common divisor, the pitch 
heard corresponds to neither the fun- 
damental frequency nor the frequency 
spacing between the harmonics (called 
_ the "pitch shift of the residue"). 
It seems likely that a better way to 
consider all these musical issues is in 
terms of the biological rationale for 
evolving a sense of tonality in the first 
place rather than by pondering math- 
ematical or other abstract relationships. 
The External Ear

Since the auditory system evolved in 
the world of natural sounds, it is pre- 
sumably important that the majority of 
periodic sounds humans were exposed 
to over evolutionary time were those 
made by the human vocal tract in the 
process of communication, initially pre- 
linguistic but, more recently, speech 
sounds (see Chapter 27). Developing a 
sense of tonality would enable listeners 
to respond not only to the distinctions 
among the different speech sounds that 
are important for understanding spoken 
language, but also to information about 
the probable sex, age, and emotional 
state of the speaker. It may thus be that 
music reflects the advantage of facilitat- 
ing a listener's ability to glean the lin- 
guistic intent and biological state of fel- 
low humans through vocal utterances. 
In keeping with this general idea, 
Michael Lewicki and his colleagues 
have argued that both music and 
speech are based on the demands of 
processing vocal sounds compared to 
the demands of processing nonvocal 
environmental sounds. Other recent 
work has shown that scale preferences 
can be explained in terms of the har- 
monic series that characterize voiced 
speech and that the emotional impact 
of major and minor scales tracks the 
differences in the harmonic ratios evi- 
dent in excited versus subdued speech. 
This text has emphasized that audi- 
tory systems may have evolved to deal 
with different categories of natural 
sound stimuli, a premise that seems 
a promising framework for ultimately 
rationalizing the phenomenology of 
tonal music,

The external ear, which consists of the pinna, concha, 
and auditory meatus, gathers sound energy and focuses 
it on the eardrum, or tympanic membrane (Figure 13.3). 
One consequence of the configuration of the human audi- 
tory meatus is that it selectively boosts the sound pressure 
30- to 100-fold for frequencies around 3 kHz via passive 
resonance effects. This amplification makes humans espe- 
cially sensitive to frequencies in the range of 2-5 kHz—and 
also explains why we are particularly prone to hearing loss 
near this frequency following exposure to loud broadband 
noises, such as those generated by heavy machinery or ex- 
plosives (see Box 13A). In humans, the sensitivity to this 
frequency range appears to be directly related to speech 
perception. Although human speech is a broadband signal, 
important spectral cues used for discriminating different 
speech sounds, including plosive consonants (e.g., ba and 
pa) are concentrated around 3 kHz (see Box 27A). There- 
fore, selective hearing loss in the 2-5 kHz range dispropor- 
tionately degrades speech recognition.

This feature, along with the lever action of the malleus, incus, 
and stapes, facilitates transmission of airborne sounds to the 
fluid-filled cochlea. 
A second important function of the pinna and concha 
is to selectively filter different sound frequencies in order 
to provide cues about the elevation of the sound source. 
The vertically asymmetrical convolutions of the pinna are 
shaped so that the external ear transmits more high-fre- 
quency components from an elevated source than from the 
same source at ear level. This effect can be demonstrated 
by recording identical sounds from different elevations after 
they have passed through an "artificial" external ear; when 
the recorded sounds are played back via earphones, so that 
the whole series is presented from a source at the same 
elevation relative to the listener, the recordings from higher 
elevations are perceived as coming from positions higher in 
space than the recordings from lower elevations.

Outer ear 
The Middle Ear 
Sounds impinging on the external ear are airborne; how- 
ever, the environment within the inner ear, where the 
sound-induced vibrations are converted to neural impulses, 
is aqueous. The major function of the middle ear is to match 
relatively low-impedance airborne sounds to the higher- 
impedance fluid of the inner ear. The term "impedance" in 
this context describes a medium's resistance to movement. 
Normally, when sound waves travel from a low-impedance 
medium such as air to a much higher-impedance medium 
such as water, almost all (more than 99.9%) of the acous- 
tical energy is reflected. The middle ear (see Figure 13.3) 
overcomes this problem and ensures transmission of the 
sound energy across the air—fluid boundary by boosting the 
pressure measured at the tympanic membrane almost 200- 
fold by the time it reaches the inner ear. 
Two mechanical processes occur within the middle ear to 
achieve this large pressure gain. The first and miajor boost 
is achieved by focusing the force impinging on the rela- 
tively large-diameter tympanic membrane onto the much 
—

smaller-diameter oval window, the site where the bones of 
the middle ear contact the inner ear. A second and related 
process relies on the mechanical advantage gained by the 
lever action of the three small, interconnected middle ear 
bones, or ossicles (i.e., the malleus, incus, and stapes; see 
Figure 13.3), which connect the tympanic membrane to the 
oval window. Conductive hearing losses, which involve 
damage to the external or middle ear, lower the efficiency at 
which sound energy is transferred to the inner ear and can 
be partially overcome by artificially boosting sound pressure 
levels with an external hearing aid (Box 13C). In normal 
hearing, the.efficiency of sound transmission to the inner 
ear also is regulated by two small muscles in the middle 
ear, the tensor tympani, innervated by cranial nerve V, and 
the stapedius, innervated by cranial nerve VII (see the Ap- 
pendix). Contraction of these muscles, which is triggered 
automatically by loud noises or during self-generated vo- 
calization, counteracts the movement of the ossicles and 
THE AUDITORY SYSTEM 
283 
reduces the amount of sound energy transmitted to the co- 
chlea, serving to protect the inner ear. Conversely, condi- 
tions that lead to flaccid paralysis of either of these muscles, 
such as Bell's palsy (nerve VII), can trigger a painful sensi- 
tivity to moderate or even low-intensity sounds known as 
hyperacusis. 
Bony tissues and soft tissues, including those surround- 
ing the inner ear, have impedance values close to that of 
water. Therefore, even without an intact tympanic mem- 
brane or middle-ear ossicles, acoustical vibrations of suf- 
ficient energy, such as those arising from a tuning fork di- 
rectly touching the head, can still be transferred directly 
through the bones and tissues of the head to the inner 
ear. In the clinic, the Weber test uses a tuning fork placed 
against the scalp to determine whether hearing loss is due 
to conductive problems or to damage either to the hair cells 
of the inner ear or to the auditory nerve itself (sensorineu- 
The same features that make the audi- 
tory periphery exquisitely sensitive to 
detecting airborne sounds also make 
it highly vulnerable to damage. By far 
_ the most common forms of hearing 
loss involve the peripheral auditory 
system—namely, those structures that 
_ transmit and transduce sounds into 
neural impulses. Monaural hearing 
deficits are the defining symptom of a 
peripheral hearing loss, because uni- 
lateral damage at or above the auditory 
brainstem results in a binaural deficit 
(due to the extensive bilateral organi- 
zation of the central auditory system). 
Peripheral hearing insults can be fur- 
ther divided into conductive hearing 
losses, which involve damage to the 
outer or middle ear, and sensorineural 
hearing losses, which stem from dam- 
age to the inner ear, most typically the 
cochlear hair cells or the auditory nerve 
itself. Although both forms of periph- 
eral hearing loss manifest themselves 
as araised threshold for hearing on the 
affected side, their diagnoses and treat- 
ments differ. 
Conductive hearing loss can be 
due to occlusion of the ear canal by 
wax or foreign objects, rupture of the 
tympanic membrane itself, or arthritic 
ossification of the middle ear bones. 
_ In contrast, sensorineural hearing loss 
BOX 13C Sensorineural Hearing Loss and Cochlear Implants 
usually is due to congenital or envi- 
ronmental insults that lead to hair 
cell death (see Box 13A) or damage to 
the auditory nerve. As hair cells are 
relatively few in number and do not 
regenerate in humans, their depletion 
leads to a diminished ability to detect 
sounds. The Weber test, a simple test 
involving a tuning fork, can be used to 
distinguish between these two forms 
of hearing loss. If a resonating tuning 
fork (~256 Hz) is placed on the vertex, 
a patient with conductive hearing loss 
will report that the sound is louder 
in the affected ear. In the "plugged" 
state, sounds propagating through 
the skull do not dissipate so freely 
back out through the auditory meatus, 
and thus a greater amount of sound 
energy is transmitted to the cochlea 
on the blocked side. In contrast, a 
patient with a monaural sensorineural 
hearing loss will report that a Weber 
test sounds louder on the intact side, 
because even though the inner ear 
may vibrate equally on the two sides, 
the damaged side cannot transduce 
this vibration into a neural signal. 
Treatment also differs for these two 
types of deafness. In conductive hearing 
losses, an external hearing aid is used 
to boost sounds to compensate for the 
reduced efficiency of the conductive 
ral hearing loss; see Boxes 13A and 13C). 
apparatus. These miniature devices, 
which are inserted into the ear canal, 
contain a microphone, a speaker, and 
an amplifier. One limitation of hearing 
aids is that they often provide rather flat 
amplification curves, which can inter- 
fere with listening in noisy environ- 
ments; moreover, they do not achieve 
a high degree of directionality. The use 
of digital signal-processing strategies 
partly overcomes these problems, and 
hearing aids obviously provide signifi- 
cant benefits to many people. 
The treatment of profound sensori- 
neural hearing loss is more complicated 
and invasive; conventional hearing 
aids are useless, because no amount 
of mechanical amplification can com- 
pensate for the inability to generate 
or convey a neural impulse from the 
cochlea. However, if the auditory nerve 
is intact, cochlear implants can partially 
restore hearing. The implant consists of 
a peripherally mounted microphone and 
digital signal processor that transforms 
a sound into its spectral components. 
Additional electronics use this informa- 
tion to activate different combinations 
of contacts on a multisite stimulating 
electrode array. The electrode is inserted 
into the cochlea through the round win- 
dow (see figure) and positioned along

approach to stimulate the cochlear 
nuclei directly, bypassing the auditory 
periphery altogether.

The Inner Ear 
The cochlea of the inner ear is arguably the most critical and 
fascinating structure in the peripheral auditory pathway, for 
it is there that the energy from sonically generated pressure 
waves is transformed into neural impulses. The cochlea not 
only amplifies sound waves and converts them into neural 
signals, but it also acts as a mechanical frequency analyzer,

decomposing complex acoustical waveforms into simpler 
elements. Many features of auditory perception accord with 
aspects of the physical properties of the cochlea; hence, it is 
important to consider this structure in some detail. 
The cochlea (from the Latin for "snail") is a small (about 
10 mm wide) coiled structure, which, were it uncoiled, 
would form a tube about 35 mm long (Figures 13.4 and

bisected from its basal end almost to its apical end by the 
cochlear partition, a flexible structure that supports the bas- 
ilar membrane and the tectorial membrane. There are 
fluid-filled chambers on each side of the cochlear partition,

that inward movement of the oval window displaces the 
fluid of the inner ear, causing the round window to bulge 
out slightly and deforming the cochlear partition. 
The manner in which the basilar membrane vibrates in 
response to sound is the key to understanding how hear- 
ing is initiated. Measurements of the vibration of different 
parts of the basilar membrane, as well as the discharge rates 
of individual auditory nerve fibers that terminate along its 
length, show that both of these features are tuned; that is, 
although they respond to a broad range of frequencies, they 
respond most intensely to a specific frequency. Frequency 
tuning within the inner ear is attributable in part to the ge- 
ometry of the basilar membrane, which is wider and more 
flexible at the apical end and narrower and stiffer at the 
basal end. Georg von Békésy, working at Harvard Univer- 
sity, showed that a membrane that varies systematically in 
its width and flexibility vibrates maximally at different po- 
sitions as a function of the stimulus frequency (see Figure 
13.5). Using models and human cochleas taken from cadav- 
ers, von Békésy found that an acoustical stimulus such as 
a sine tone initiates a traveling wave in the cochlea that

propagates from the base toward the apex of the basilar 
membrane, growing in amplitude and slowing in veloc- 
ity until a point of maximum displacement is reached. The 
point of maximal displacement is determined by the fre- 
quency of the stimulus and persists vibrating in that pattern 
as long as the tone endures. The points responding to high 
frequencies are at the base of the basilar membrane where 
it is stiffer, and the points responding to low frequencies 
are at the apex, giving rise to a topographical mapping of 
frequency (i.e., tonotopy). Complex tonal stimuli cause a 
pattern of vibration equivalent to the superposition of the 
vibrations generated by the individual tones making up that 
complex sound, thus accounting for the decompositional 
aspects of cochlear function mentioned earlier. This process 
of spectral decomposition appears to be an important strat- 
egy for detecting the various harmonic combinations that 
distinguish natural sounds that have a periodic character, 
such as vowels and some consonants in speech. 
The traveling wave initiates sensory transduction by dis- 
placing the sensory hair cells that sit atop the basilar mem- 
brane. Because the basilar membrane and the overlying 
tectorial membrane are anchored at different positions, the 
vertical component of the traveling wave is translated into 
a shearing motion between these two membranes (Figure 
13.6). This motion bends the tiny processes, called stereo- 
cilia, that protrude from the apical ends of the hair cells, 
leading to voltage changes across the hair-cell membrane. 
How the bending of stereocilia leads to receptor potentials 
in hair cells is considered in the following section.

the pivot point of the tectorial membrane so that when the basilar membrane is 
displaced by a sine wave, the tectorial membrane moves across the tops of the 
hair cells, bending the stereocilia.

Hair Cells and the 
Mechanoelectrical 
Transduction of Sound Waves 
The hair cell is an evolutionary triumph that 
solves the problem of transforming vibrational 
energy into an electrical signal. The scale at 
which the hair cell operates is truly amazing. 
At the limits of human hearing, hair cells can 
faithfully detect movements of atomic dimen- 
sions and respond in tens of microseconds! Fur- 
thermore, hair cells can adapt rapidly to con- 
stant stimuli, thus allowing the listener to extract 
signals from a noisy background. 
The cochlear hair cells in humans consist 
of one row of inner hair cells and three rows 
of outer hair cells (see Figures 13.4 and 13.7). 
The inner hair cells are the sensory receptors, 
and 95% of the fibers of the auditory nerve that 
project to the brain arise from this subpopula- 
tion. The terminations on the outer hair cells are 
almost all from efferent axons that arise from 
cells in the superior olivary complex. Current 
evidence suggests that the outer hair cells play 
an important role in modulating basilar mem- 
brane motions and that they function as an 
important component of the cochlear amplifier 
(see below). 
The hair cell is a flask-shaped epithelial cell 
named for the bundle of hairlike processes that 
protrude from its apical end into the scala media. 
Each hair bundle contains anywhere from 30 to 
a few hundred stereocilia, with one taller kino- 
cilium (Figure 13.7A). Despite their names, only 
the kinocilium is a true ciliary structure, with the 
characteristic "9 + 2" structure (i.e., two central 
tubules surrounded by nine doublet tubules) 
that define cilia (Figure 13.7B). The function of 
the kinocilium is unclear, and in mammalian 
cochlear hair cells it disappears shortly after 
birth (Figure 13.7C). The stereocilia are simpler, 
containing only an actin cytoskeleton. Hach ste- 
reocilium tapers where it inserts into the apical 
membrane, forming a hinge about which each 
stereocilium pivots. The stereocilia are graded 
in height and are arranged in a bilaterally sym- 
metric fashion (see Figure 13.7C); in vestibular 
hair cells, this plane runs through the kinocilium 
(see Figure 13.7A). Fine filamentous structures, 
known as tip links, run in parallel to the plane 
of bilateral symmetry, connecting the tips of ad- 
jacent stereocilia (Figure 13.7D).

resulting depolarization of the hair cell opens voltage-gated Ca?* 
channels in the cell soma, allowing calcium entry and release of neu- 
rotransmitter onto the nerve endings of the auditory nerve. (After

pathways used in visual and olfactory transduction (see 

290 
CHAPTER 13 
Chapters 11 and 15). Although mechanotransduction is ex- 
tremely fast, springiness of the tip link introduces distortion 
effects that, in some cases, are audible (see Box 13D). More- 
over, the exquisite mechanical sensitivity of the stereocilia 
also presents substantial risks. High-intensity sounds can 
shear off the hair bundle, resulting 
in profound hearing 
deficits. Because human stereocilia, unlike those in fishes 
and birds, do not regenerate, such damage is irreversible. 
The small number of hair cells (a total of about 30,000 in a 
human, or 15,000 per ear) further compounds the sensitiv- 
ity of the inner ear to environmental and genetic insults. An 
important goal of current research is to identify stem cells 
and factors that could contribute to the regeneration of hu- 
man hair cells, thus affording a possible therapy for some 
forms of sensorineural hearing loss. 
The lonic Basis of 
Mechanotransduction in Hair Cells 
Understanding the ionic basis of hair-cell transduction has 
been greatly advanced by intracellular recordings made 
from these tiny structures. The hair cell has a resting poten- 
tial between —45 and -60 mV relative to the fluid that bathes 
the basal end of the cell. At the resting potential, only a 
small fraction of the transduction channels are open. When 
the hair bundle is displaced in the direction of the tallest 
stereocilium, more transduction channels open, causing 
depolarization as K* enter the cell (see Figure 13.9). Depo- 
larization in turn opens voltage-gated calcium channels in 
the hair-cell membrane, and the resultant Ca?* influx causes 
transmitter release from the basal end of the cell onto the 
auditory nerve endings (see Figure 13.8A,B). Such calcium- 
dependent exocytosis is similar to chemical neurotransmis- 
sion elsewhere in the central and peripheral nervous sys- 
tems (see Chapters 5 and 6); thus, the hair cell has become 
a useful model for studying calcium-dependent transmitter 
release. Because some transduction channels are open at 
rest, the receptor potential is biphasic: movement toward 
the tallest stereocilia depolarizes the cell, whereas move- 
ment in the opposite direction leads to hyperpolarization. 
This situation allows the hair cell to generate a sinusoidal 
receptor potential in response to a sinusoidal stimulus, thus 
preserving the temporal information present in the origi- 
nal signal, up to frequencies of around 3 kHz (see Figure 
13.9). Hair cells still can signal at frequencies above 3 kHz, 
although without preserving the exact temporal structure 
of the stimulus; the cell's membrane time-constant filters 
the asymmetric displacement-receptor current function of 
the hair-cell bundle to produce a tonic depolarization of 
the soma, augmenting transmitter release and thus exciting 
auditory nerve terminals. 
The high-speed demands of mechanoelectrical transduc- 
tion have resulted in some impressive specializations of the 
ion fluxes within the inner ear. An unusual adaptation of the 
hair cell in this regard is that K* serves both to depolarize 
and repolarize the cell, enabling the hair cell's K* gradient 
to be largely maintained by passive ion movement alone. As 
with other epithelial cells, the basal and apical surfaces of the 
hair cell are separated by tight junctions, allowing separate 
extracellular ionic environments at these two surfaces. The 
apical end (including the stereocilia) protrudes into the scala 
media and is exposed to the K*-rich, Na*-poor endolymph 
produced by dedicated ion-pumping cells in the stria vas- 
cularis (Figure 13.10). The basal end of the hair-cell body 
is bathed in perilymph—the same fluid that fills the scala 
tympani. Perilymph resembles other extracellular fluids in 
that it is K*-poor and Na*-rich. However, the compartment 
containing endolymph is about 80 mV more positive than 
the perilymph compartment (this difference is known as the 
endocochlear potential), while the inside of the hair cell is about 
45 mV more negative than the perilymph and about 125 mV 
more negative than the endolymph.

Depolarization and repolarization of

electrical potential of +80 mV relative to the perilymph. This 
endocochlear potential drives K* into open transduction chan- 
nels located at the apical ends of the stereocilia; the resulting 
depolarization of the hair-cell body opens somatic K* channels.

vascularis 

hair cell's resting potential and the endocochlear potential) 
drives K* through open transduction channels into the hair 
cell, even though these cells already have a high internal 
K* concentration. K* entry via the transduction channels 
electrotonically depolarizes the hair cell, opening voltage- 
gated Ca** and K* channels located in the membrane of 
the hair-cell soma (see Box 14B). The opening of somatic 
K* channels favors K* efflux, and thus repolarization; the 
efflux occurs because the perilymph surrounding the basal 
end is low in K* relative to the cytosol and because the 
equilibrium potential for K* is more negative than the hair 
cell's resting potential (E,,.., = -85 mV). Repolarization of 
the hair cell via K* efflux is also facilitated by Ca?* entry. 
In addition to modulating the release of neurotransmitter, 
Ca** entry opens Ca**-dependent K* channels, which pro- 
vide another avenue for K* to enter the perilymph. Indeed, 
the interaction of Ca** influx and Ca?*-dependent K* efflux 
can lead to electrical resonances that enhance the tuning 
of response properties within the inner ear (also explained 
in Box 14B). 
In essence, the hair cell operates as two distinct compart- 
ments, each dominated by its own Nernst equilibrium po- 
tential for K*; this arrangement ensures that the hair cell's 
ionic gradient does not run down, even during prolonged 
stimulation. The rupture of Reissner's membrane (which 
normally separates the scalae media and vestibuli) or the 
presence of compounds such as ethacrynic acid that selec- 
tively poison the ion-pumping cells of the stria vascularis 
can cause the endocochlear potential to dissipate, resulting 
in a sensorineural hearing deficit (see Box 13A). In short, 
the hair cell exploits the different ionic milieus of its apical 
and basal surfaces to provide extremely fast and energy- 
efficient repolarization. 
The Cochlear Amplifier 
Von Békésy's model of cochlear mechanics was a passive 
one, resting on the premise that the basilar membrane 
acts like a series of linked resonators, much as a concat- 
enated set of tuning forks. More recent studies made from 
the intact, living cochlea, however, indicate that normal 
hearing depends on the activity of a biological amplifier 
located within the cochlea. The rationale for this is based 
on three observations. First, the tuning of the auditory 
periphery, whether measured at the basilar membrane or 
recorded as the electrical activity of auditory nerve fibers, 
is too sharp to be explained by passive mechanics alone. 
Second, at very low sound intensities, the basilar mem- 
brane vibrates 100-fold more than would be predicted by 
linear extrapolation from the motion measured at high 
intensities. Third, the ear can generate sounds under cer- 
tain conditions. These otoacoustic emissions, which can 
be detected by placing a sensitive microphone at the ear- 
drum and monitoring the response after briefly presenting 
THE AUDITORY SYSTEM 
291 
a tone or click, provide a useful means to assess cochlear 
function in the newborn, and this test is now done rou- 
tinely to rule out congenital deafness. Such emissions, 
called cochlear microphonics, can also occur sponta- 
neously, especially in patients suffering from certain pa- 
thologies. They are thus one source of tinnitus (ringing in 
the ears); most cases of tinnitus, however, arise centrally 
for reasons that are not understood. These various obser- 
vations indicate that the ear's sensitivity arises from an 
active biomechanical process as well as from its passive 
resonant properties (Box 13D). 
Although the basis for this active process remains a mat- 
ter of debate, evidence suggests that the outer hair cells 
are an essential component of the cochlear amplifier. First, 
the high sensitivity "notch" of auditory nerve tuning curves 
is lost when the outer hair cells are selectively inactivated. 
Second, mutant mice lacking inner hair cells, although 
deaf, nonetheless produce otoacoustic emissions. Finally, 
isolated outer hair cells contract and expand in response to 
small electrical currents, thus providing a potential source of 
energy to drive an active process within the cochlea. How- 
ever, transduction currents may provide another source of 
energy driving basilar membrane motions, raising the pos- 
sibility that inner hair cells also contribute to amplification. 
Ultimately, active processes such as these are needed to 
explain the remarkable sensitivity of the auditory system 
to faint sounds. 
Tuning and Timing in 
the Auditory Nerve 
The rapid response time of the transduction apparatus 
allows the membrane potential of the hair cell to follow 
deflections of the hair bundle up to moderately high fre- 
quencies of oscillation (~3 kHz). As a result, frequencies 
below 3 kHz can be encoded by the temporal patterns of 
activity of hair cells and their associated auditory nerve fi- 
bers. Even these extraordinarily rapid processes, however, 
fail to follow frequencies above 3 kHz (see above and Figure 
13.9). Accordingly, some other mechanism must be used 
to transmit auditory information at higher frequencies. 
The tonotopically organized basilar membrane provides an 
alternative to temporal coding—namely, a "labeled-line" 
coding mechanism. 
In labeled-line coding, frequency information is speci- 
fied by preserving tonotopy at higher levels in the auditory 
pathway. Because a single auditory nerve fiber innervates 
only a single inner hair cell (although several or more audi- 
tory nerve fibers synapse on a single hair cell), each audi- 
tory nerve fiber transmits information about only a small 
part of the audible frequency spectrum. As a result, audi- 
tory nerve fibers related to the apical end of the cochlea 
respond to low frequencies, and fibers that are related to 
the basal end respond to high frequencies (see Figure 13.5).

CHAPTER 13 
BOX 13D The Sweet Sound of Distortion 
_ As early as the first half of the eigh- 
| teenth century, musical composers such 
as G. Tartini and W. A. Sorge discov- 
ered that, upon playing pairs of tones, 
other tones not present in the original 
stimulus are also heard. These com- 
bination tones, fc, are mathematically 
related to the played tones, f, and f, (f, 
> f,), by the formula 
fc= mf, + nf, 
| where m and 7 are positive integers. 
_ Combination tones have been used 
_ for a variety of compositional effects, 
as they can strengthen the harmonic 
_ texture of a chord. Furthermore, organ 
_ builders sometimes use the difference 
_ tone (f, —f,) created by two smaller 
_ organ pipes to produce the extremely 
_ low tones that would otherwise require 
_ building one especially large pipe. 
Modern experiments suggest that 
_ this distortion product is due at least 
in part to the nonlinear properties of 
the inner ear. M. Ruggero and his col- 
leagues placed small glass beads (10-30 
nm in diameter) on the basilar mem- 
brane of an anesthetized animal and 
then determined the movement of the 
basilar membrane in response to differ- 
ent combinations of tones by measuring 
the Doppler shift of laser light reflected 
from the beads. When two tones were 
played into the ear, the basilar mem- 
brane vibrated not only at those two 
frequencies but also at other frequen- 
cies predicted by the above formula. 
Related experiments on hair cells stud- 
ied in vitro suggest that these nonlin- 
earities result from the properties of the 
mechanical linkage of the transduction 
apparatus. By moving the hair bundle 
sinusoidally with a metal-coated glass 
fiber, A. J. Hudspeth and his cowork- 
ers found that the hair bundle exerts a 
force at the same frequency. However, 
when two sinusoids were applied 
simultaneously, the forces exerted by 
the hair bundle occurred not only at 
the primary frequencies but at several 
combination frequencies as well. These 
distortion products are due to the trans- 
duction apparatus, because blocking the 
transduction channels causes the forces 
exerted at the combination frequencies 
to disappear, even though the forces at 
the primary frequencies remain unaf- 
fected. It seems that the tip links add 
a certain extra springiness to the hair 
bundle in the small range of motions 
over which the transduction channels 
are changing between closed and open 
states. If nonlinear distortions of basilar 
membrane vibrations arise from the 
properties of the hair bundle, then it is 
likely that hair cells can indeed influ- 
ence basilar membrane motion, thereby 
accounting for the cochlea's extreme 
sensitivity. When we hear difference 
tones, we may be paying the price in 
distortion for an exquisitely fast and 
sensitive transduction mechanism.

The properties of specific fibers can be seen in electrophys- 
iological recordings of responses to sound (Figure 13.11). 
These threshold functions are called tuning curves, and 
the lowest threshold of the tuning curve is called the char- 
acteristic frequency. Since the topographical order of the 
characteristic frequency of neurons is retained throughout 
the system, information about frequency is also preserved. 
Cochlear implants (see Box 13C) exploit the tonotopic 
organization of the cochlea, and particularly its auditory 
nerve afferents, to roughly recreate the patterns of auditory 
nerve activity elicited by sounds. In patients with damaged 
hair cells, such implants can effectively bypass the impaired 
transduction apparatus, and thus restore some degree of 
auditory function. 
The other prominent feature of hair cells—their ability 
to follow the waveform of low-frequency sounds—is also 
important in other, more subtle aspects of auditory cod- 
ing. As mentioned earlier, hair cells have biphasic response 
properties. Because hair cells release transmitter only when 
depolarized, auditory nerve fibers fire only during the posi- 
tive phases of low-frequency sounds (see Figure 13.11). The 
resultant "phase-locking" provides temporal information 
from the two ears to neural centers that compare interaural 
time differences for frequencies up to 3 kHz. The evalua- 
tion of interaural time differences provides a critical cue for 
sound localization and the perception of auditory "space." 
That auditory space can be perceived is remarkable, given 
that the cochlea, unlike the retina, cannot represent space 
directly. 
Much of the information described in these sections in- 
dicates that auditory nerve activity patterns are not simply 
neural replicas of the auditory stimulus itself. This conclu- 
sion accords with what is known about other sensory sys- 
tems, all of which are specialized to process information 
that is particularly important for the species in question. 
An example in hearing is work by William Bialek and his 
colleagues at Princeton University, who have shown that 
the auditory nerve in the bullfrog encodes conspecific mat- 
ing calls more efficiently than artificial sounds with similar 
frequency and amplitude characteristics, This and other 
studies suggest that the auditory periphery is optimized 
to transmit natural sounds, including species-typical vocal 
sounds, rather than simply transmitting all sounds equally 
well to central auditory areas.

How Information from the Cochlea 
Reaches Targets in the Brainstem 
As in the visual system, the ascending auditory system 
is organized in parallel. This arrangement becomes evi- 
dent as soon as the auditory nerve enters the brainstem, 
where it branches to innervate the three divisions of the 
cochlear nucleus. The auditory nerve (which, along with 
the vestibular nerve, constitutes cranial nerve VIII) com- 
prises the central processes of the bipolar spiral ganglion 
cells in the cochlea (see Figure 13.4); each of these cells 
sends a peripheral process to contact one or a few inner 
hair cells and a central process to innervate the cochlear 
nucleus. Within the cochlear nucleus, each auditory nerve 
fiber branches, sending an ascending branch to the antero- 
ventral cochlear nucleus and a descending branch to the 
posteroventral cochlear nucleus and the dorsal cochlear 
nucleus (Figure 13.12). The tonotopic organization of the

cochlea is maintained in the three parts of 
the cochlear nucleus, each of which contains 
different populations of cells with quite dif- 
ferent properties. In addition, the patterns of 
termination of the auditory nerve axons differ 
in density and type; thus, there are several op- 
portunities at this level for transformation of 
the information from the hair cells. 
Integrating Information 
from the Two Ears 
Just as the auditory nerve branches to inner- 
vate several different targets in the cochlear 
nuclei, the neurons in these nuclei give rise 
to several different pathways (see Figure 
13.12). One clinically relevant feature of the 
ascending projections of the auditory brain- 
stem is a high degree of bilateral connectiv- 
ity, which means that damage to central au- 
ditory structures is almost never manifested 
as a monaural hearing loss. (Sound arriving 
at one ear only is referred to as monaural.) 
Indeed, a monaural hearing loss strongly im- 
plicates unilateral peripheral damage, either 
to the middle or inner ear or to the auditory 
nerve itself (see Box 13C). Given the relatively 
byzantine organization already present at the 
level of the auditory brainstem, it is useful 
to consider these pathways in the context of 
their functions. 
The best understood function mediated by 
the auditory brainstem nuclei, and certainly 
the one most intensively studied, is sound lo- 
calization. Humans use at least two different 
strategies to localize the horizontal position of 
sound sources, depending on the frequencies 
in the stimulus. For frequencies below 3 kHz 
(which auditory nerve fibers can follow ina 
phase-locked manner), interaural time differ- 
ences are used to localize the source; above 
these frequencies, interaural intensity differ- 
ences.are used as cues. Parallel pathways 
originating from the cochlear nucleus serve 
each of these strategies for sound localization. 
FIGURE 13.12 
Diagram of the major auditory path- 
yi PM ntcrovential 
ways. Although many details are missing from this simplified 
diagram, two important points are evident: (1) the auditory 
system entails several parallel pathways and (2) information 
from each ear reaches both sides of the system, even at the 
level of the brainstem. 

The human ability to detect interaural time differences is 
remarkable. The longest interaural time differences, which 
are produced by sounds arising directly lateral to one ear, 
are on the order of only 700 microseconds (a value given 
by the width of the head divided by the speed of sound in 
air, or about 340 meters per second). Psychophysical experi- 
ments show that humans can detect interaural time differ- 
ences as small as 10 microseconds; two sounds presented 
through earphones separated by such small interaural 
time differences are perceived as arising from the side of 
the leading ear. This sensitivity translates into accuracy for 
sound localization to within about 1 degree. 
The neural circuitry that computes such tiny interaural 
time differences consists of binaural inputs to the medial 
superior olive (MSO) that arise from the right and left 
anteroventral cochlear nuclei (Figure 13.13; see also Figure 
13.12). The MSO contains cells with bipolar dendrites that 
extend both medially and laterally. The lateral dendrites 
receive input from the ipsilateral anteroventral cochlear 
nucleus, and the medial dendrites receive input from the 
contralateral anteroventral cochlear nucleus (both inputs 
are excitatory). An influential model of sound localization, 
first formally described by J. Jeffress, posits that the neurons 
of the MSO work as coincidence detectors, responding 
when both excitatory signals arrive at the same time. For 
a coincidence mechanism to be useful in localizing sound,

different neurons must be maximally sensitive to different 
interaural time delays. The axons that project from the an- 
teroventral cochlear nucleus evidently vary systematically in 
length to create delay lines. (Remember that the length of 
an axon divided by its conduction velocity equals the con- 
duction time.) These anatomical differences compensate for 
sounds arriving at slightly different times at the two ears, 
so that the resultant neural impulses arrive at a particular 
MSO neuron simultaneously, making each cell especially 
sensitive to sound sources in a particular place. Experimen- 
tal evidence of delay lines and coincidence detectors has 
been found in brainstem of the barn owl, an animal that is 
highly adept at locating and capturing prey (e.g., mice) by 
the sounds they make as they scamper along the substrate. 
However, experiments in gerbils point to a role for inhibi- 
tion in shaping MSO neuronal responses, suggesting that 
some mammals may employ additional or alternate mecha- 
nisms to compute interaural time differences. 
Sound localization perceived on the basis of interaural 
time differences requires phase-locked information from 
FIGURE 13.13 
A model of how the MSO computes the 
location of a sound by interaural time differences. A given 
MSO neuron responds most strongly when the two inputs arrive 
simultaneously, as occurs when the contralateral and ipsilateral 
inputs precisely compensate (via their different lengths) for dif- 
ferences in the time of arrival of a sound at the two ears. The 
systematic (and inverse) variation in the delay lengths of the two 
inputs creates a map of sound location. In this model, neuron E 
in the MSO would be most sensitive to sounds located to the left, 
and neuron A to sounds from the right; neuron C would respond 
best to sounds coming from directly in front of the listener. (After 
Jeffress, 1948.)

CHAPTER 13 
the periphery, which, as already emphasized, is available 
to humans only for frequencies below 3 kHz. (In barn owls, 
phase-locking occurs at up to 9 kHz.) Therefore, a second 
mechanism must come into play at higher frequencies. 
One clue to the solution is that at frequencies higher than 
about 2 kHz, the human head begins to act as an acoustical 
obstacle, because the wavelengths of the sounds are too 
short to bend around it. As a result, when high-frequency 
sounds are directed toward one side of the head, an acous- 
tical "shadow" of lower intensity is created at the far ear. 
These intensity differences provide a second cue about the 
location of a sound. The circuits that compute the position 
of a sound source on this basis are found in the lateral su- 
perior olive (LSO) and the medial nucleus of the trape- 
zoid body (MNTB) (Figure 13.14). Excitatory axons project 
directly from the ipsilateral anteroventral cochlear nucleus 
to the LSO (as well as to the MSO; see Figure 13.13). Note 
that the LSO also receives inhibitory input from the con- 
tralateral ear via an inhibitory neuron in the MNTB. This 
excitatory/inhibitory interaction results in a net excitation of 
the LSO on the same side of the body as the sound source. 
For sounds arising directly lateral to the listener, firing rates 
will be highest in the LSO on that side; in this circumstance, 
the excitation via the ipsilateral anteroventral cochlear nu- 
cleus will be maximal, and inhibition from the contralateral 
MNTB minimal. In contrast, sounds arising closer to the 
listener's midline will elicit lower firing rates in the ipsilat- 
eral LSO because of increased inhibition arising from the 
contralateral MNTB. For sounds arising at the midline, or 
from the other side, the increased inhibition arising from 
the MNTB is powerful enough to completely silence LSO

activity. Note that each LSO encodes only sounds arising 
in the ipsilateral hemifield; therefore, it takes both LSOs to 
represent the full range of horizontal positions. 
In summary, two separate pathways—and two separate 
mechanisms—enable us to localize sound along the azi- 
muth. Humans process interaural time differences in the 
medial superior olive and interaural intensity differences in 
the lateral superior olive. These two pathways eventually 
merge in the midbrain auditory centers. The elevation of 
sound sources is determined by spectral filtering mediated 
by the external pinnae. Experimental evidence suggests that 
the spectral "notches" created by the shape of the pinnae 
are detected by neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus. 
Thus, binaural cues play an important role in localizing the 
azimuthal position of sound sources, whereas spectral cues 
are used to localize the elevation of sound sources. 
FIGURE 13.14 
LSO neurons encode sound location 
through interaural intensity differences. (A) LSO neurons 
receive direct excitation from the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus; 
input from the contralateral cochlear nucleus is relayed via inhib- 
itory interneurons in the MNTB. (B) This arrangement of excita- 
tion-inhibition makes LSO neurons fire most strongly in response 
to sounds arising directly lateral to the listener on the same side 
as the LSO, because excitation from the ipsilateral input will be 
great and inhibition from the contralateral input wil! be small. 
In contrast, sounds arising from in front of the listener, or from 
the opposite side, will silence the LSO output, because excitation 
from the ipsilateral input will be minimal, but inhibition driven 
by the contralateral input will be great. Note that LSOs are paired 
and bilaterally symmetrical; each LSO encodes only the location 
of sounds arising from the ipsilateral hemifield.

Monaural Pathways from the 
Cochlear Nucleus to the Nuclei of the 
Lateral Lemniscus 
The binaural pathways for sound localization are only part 
of the output of the cochlear nucleus. This fact is hardly sur- 
prising, given that auditory perception involves much more 
than locating the position of the sound source. A second 
major set of pathways from the cochlear nucleus bypasses 
the superior olive and terminates in the nuclei of the lat- 
eral lemniscus on the contralateral side of the brainstem 
(see Figure 13.12). These particular pathways respond to 
sound arriving at one ear only and are thus referred to as 
monaural. Some cells in the lateral lemniscus nuclei signal 
the onset of sound, regardless of its intensity or frequency. 
Other cells in the lateral lemniscus nuclei process other 
temporal aspects of sound, such as duration. The role of 
these pathways in processing temporal features of sound is 
not yet known. As with the outputs of the superior olivary 
nuclei, the pathways from the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus 
converge at the midbrain. 
Integration in the Inferior Colliculus 
Auditory pathways ascending via the olivary and lemniscal 
complexes, as well as other projections that arise directly 
from the cochlear nucleus, project to the midbrain auditory 
center, also known as the inferior colliculus. In examining 
how integration occurs in the inferior colliculus, it is again 
instructive to turn to the most completely analyzed audi- 
tory mechanism, the binaural system for localizing sound. 
As already noted, space is not mapped on the auditory re- 
ceptor surface; thus, the perception of auditory space must 
somehow be synthesized by circuitry in the lower brainstem 
and midbrain. Experiments in the barn owl, an animal that 
is extraordinarily proficient at localizing sounds, show that 
the convergence of binaural inputs in the midbrain pro- 
duces something entirely new, relative to the periphery— 
namely, a computed topographical representation of audi- 
tory space. Neurons within this auditory space map in the 
colliculus respond best to sounds originating in a specific 
region of space; thus, they have both a preferred elevation 
and a preferred azimuthal location. Although the circuit 
mechanisms underlying sound localization in humans are 
unknown, humans have a clear perception of both the el- 
evational and azimuthal components of a sound's location, 
indicating that our brains contain a neural representation 
of auditory space. 
Another important property of the inferior colliculus is 
its ability to process sounds with complex temporal pat- 
terns. Many neurons in the inferior colliculus respond only 
to frequency-modulated sounds, while others respond only 
to sounds of specific durations. Such sounds are typical

components of biologically relevant sounds, such as those 
made by predators, or intraspecific communication sounds, 
which, in humans, include speech. 
The Auditory Thalamus 
Despite the parallel pathways in the auditory stations of 
the brainstem and midbrain, the medial geniculate com- 
plex (MGC) in the thalamus is an obligatory relay for all 
ascending auditory information destined for the cortex 
(see Figure 13.12). Most input to the MGC arises from 
the inferior colliculus, although a few auditory axons from 
the lower brainstem bypass the inferior colliculus to reach 
the auditory thalamus directly. The MGC has several divi- 
sions, including the ventral division, which functions as 
the major thalamocortical relay, and the dorsal and me- 
dial divisions, which are organized like a belt around the 
ventral division. 
ve 
In some mammals, the strictly maintained tonotopy 
of the lower brainstem areas is exploited by convergence 
onto MGC neurons, generating specific responses to cer- 
tain spectral combinations. The original evidence for this 
statement came from research on the response properties 
of cells in the MGC of echolocating bats. Some cells in the 
so-called belt areas of the bat MGC respond only to combi- 
nations of widely spaced frequencies that are specific com- 
ponents of the bat's echolocation signal and of the echoes 
that are reflected from objects in the bat's environment. In 
the mustached bat, where this phenomenon has been most 
thoroughly studied, the echolocation pulse has a changing 
frequency (frequency-modulated, or FM) component that 
includes a fundamental frequency and one or more har- 
monics. The fundamental frequency (FM,) has low intensity 
and sweeps from 30-20 kHz. The second harmonic (FM,) 
is the most intense component and sweeps from 60-40 
kHz. Note that these frequencies do not overlap. Most of 
the echoes are from the intense FM, sound, and virtually 
none arise from the weak FM,, even though the emitted 
FM, is loud enough for the bat to hear. Apparently, the bat 
assesses the distance to an object by measuring the delay 
between the FM, emission and the FM, echo. Certain MGC 
neurons respond when FM, follows FM, by a specific delay, 
providing a mechanism for sensing such frequency combi- 
nations. Because each neuron responds best to a particular 
delay, the population of MGC neurons encodes a range of 
distances. 
Bat sonar illustrates two important points about the 
function of the auditory thalamus. First, the MGC is the 
first station in the auditory pathway where pronounced 
selectivity for combinations of frequencies is found. The 
mechanism responsible for this selectivity is presumably 
the ultimate convergence of many inputs from cochlear re- 
gions with different spectral sensitivities. Second, cells in 

298 
CHAPTER 13 
the MGC are selective not only for frequency combinations, 
but also for specific time intervals between the two frequen- 
cies. The principle is the same as that described for binaural 
neurons in the medial superior olive, but in this instance, 
two monaural signals with different frequency sensitivities 
coincide, and the time difference is in the millisecond rather 
than the microsecond range. For echolocating bats, time 
differences in the millisecond range correspond to target 
distances of catchable prey. Interestingly, speech sounds 
change continuously over the range of a few milliseconds, 
suggesting that MGC neurons in the human capable of in- 
tegrating acoustical information over the millisecond tim- 
escale could facilitate speech perception. 
In summary, neurons in the medial geniculate complex 
receive convergent inputs from spectrally and temporally 
separate pathways. This complex, by virtue of its conver- 
gent inputs, mediates the detection of specific spectral and 
temporal combinations of sounds. In many species, includ- 
ing humans, varying spectral and temporal cues are espe- 
cially important features of communication sounds. It is not 
known whether cells in the human medial geniculate are 
selective to combinations of sounds, but the processing of 
speech certainly requires both spectral and temporal com- 
bination sensitivity.

The Auditory Cortex 
The auditory cortex is the major target of the ascending fi- 
bers from the MGC, and it plays an essential role in our 
conscious perception of sound, including recognition of 
speech. Despite the obvious importance of auditory corti- 
cal processing for sound perception, the auditory cortex has 
been less completely studied than the auditory periphery 
and is less well understood than visual cortex (although 
one should hasten to add that the mechanisms of both pe- 
ripheral auditory processing and visual cortical processing 
are far from clear). 
Although the auditory cortex has a number of subdivi- 
sions, as in the visual and somatic sensory systems a broad 
distinction can be made between a primary area and a pe- 
ripheral, or secondary, area. The primary auditory cortex, 
or A1, is located on the superior temporal gyrus in the 
temporal lobe and receives point-to-point input from the 
ventral division of the medial geniculate complex; thus, it 
contains a precise tonotopic map. The belt areas of the au- 
ditory cortex receive more diffuse input from the belt areas 
of the medial geniculate complex, as well as input from the 
primary auditory cortex, and are less precise in their tono- 
topic organization.

(plane of dashed line) shows the cortical 
areas on the superior surface of the temporal 
lobe. Note that Wernicke's area, a region 
important in comprehending speech, is just 
posterior to the primary auditory cortex. 

The primary auditory cortex has a topographical map of 
the cochlea (Figure 13.15), just as the primary visual cor- 
tex (V1) and the primary somatic sensory cortex (S1) have 
topographical maps of their respective sensory epithelia. 
Just as the visual and somatic sensory systems represent 
their peripheral receptor surfaces in central maps, so the or- 
ganization of the cochlea is laid out in a central map. Since 
frequencies are arrayed tonotopically along the length of 
the basilar membrane, this organization as reflected in A1 is 
said to comprise a tonotopic map, as do most of the ascend- 
ing auditory structures between the cochlea and the cortex. 
Orthogonal to the frequency axis of the tonotopic map are 
irregular patches of neurons that are excited by both ears 
(and are therefore called EE cells) interspersed with patches 
of cells that are excited by one ear and inhibited by the other 
ear (EI cells). The EE and EI stripes alternate, an arrange- 
ment that is reminiscent of the ocular dominance columns 
in V1 (see Chapter 12). In neither case is the reason for this 
segregation known, although the cause seems to be com- 
peting patterns of neural activity. 
THE AUDITORY SYSTEM 
299 
The auditory cortex obviously does much more than 
provide a tonotopic map and respond differentially to ip- 
silateral and contralateral stimulation. The sorts of sensory 
processing that occur in the auditory cortex are not well 
understood, but they are likely to be important to higher 
order processing of natural sounds, especially those used 
for communication (Box 13E; see also Chapter 27). One clue 
about such processing comes from work in marmosets, a 
small New World monkey with a complex vocal repertoire. 
The A1 and belt areas of these animals are indeed orga- 
nized tonotopically, but they also contain neurons that are 
strongly responsive to spectral combinations that character- 
ize certain vocalizations. The responses of these neurons to 
the tonal stimuli do not accurately predict their responses 
to the spectral combinations, suggesting that, in accordance 
with peripheral optimization, cortical processing is, in part, 
dedicated to detecting particular intraspecific vocalizations. 
Recent studies in marmosets and humans also implicate 
secondary regions of the auditory cortex in the perception 
of pitch. This percept is especially important to our musical 
BOX 13E 
Representing Complex Sounds in the Brains of Bats and Humans 
Most natural sounds are complex, 
meaning that they differ from the pure 
tones or clicks that are frequently used 
in neurophysiological studies of the 
auditory system. Only a small minor- 
ity of natural sounds are tonal, but 
when they occur the stimuli have a

determines the "pitch" of the sound, 
or "timbre" of a sound. The frequency 
of a harmonic is, by definition, 
a mul- 
tiple of the fundamental frequency, 
and both may be modulated over time. 
Such frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps 
can rise or fall in frequency, or they can 
change in a sinusoidal (or some other) 
fashion. Occasionally, multiple nonhar- 
monic frequencies may be simultane-

cally accompanied by a modulation of 
the amplitude envelope of the complex 
sound, as well. All of these features can 
be visualized by spectrographic analysis. 
How does the brain represent such 
complex natural sounds? Cognitive 
studies of complex sound perception 
provide some understanding of how a 
large but limited number of neurons 
in the brain can dynamically represent 
an infinite variety of natural stimuli in 
the sensory environment of humans 
and other animals. In bats, specializa- 
and one or more harmonics of different 
tions for processing complex sounds 
intensities that contribute to the quality 
are apparent. Studies in echolocating 
bats show that both communication 
and echolocation sounds (Figure A) 
are processed not only within some 
of the same areas, but also within the 
same neurons in the auditory cortex. 
In humans, multiple modes of pro- 
cessing are also likely, given the large 
overlap within the superior and middle 
temporal gyri in the temporal lobe for 
the representation of different types of 
complex sounds.

underscores the idea that the auditory cortex is doing far 
more than faithfully representing what the auditory periph- 
ery provides as input. 
Another clue about the role of the primary auditory cor- 
tex in the processing of intraspecific communication sounds 
comes from work in echolocating bats. Consistent with the 
essential role that echolocation plays in the survival of these 
animals, certain regions of the bat A1, like those described 

in the medial geniculate complex, are tuned in a system- 
atic manner to the delays between frequency-modulated 
pulses and their echoes, thus providing information about 
target distance and velocity. These delay-tuned neurons can 
exhibit highly specific responses to intraspecific communi- 
cation calls, suggesting that the same cortical neurons can 
serve these two distinct auditory functions (see Box 13E). 
Evidently, the general ability of the mammalian auditory 
cortex to detect certain spectral and temporal combinations 
of natural sounds has been exploited in bats to serve sonar- 
mediated navigation, yielding these dual-function neurons. 
Many of the dually specialized neurons are categorized 
as "combination-sensitive" neurons—that is, neurons 
that show a nonlinear increase in their response magni- 
tude when presented with a combination of tones and/or 
noise bands in comparison to the total magnitude of the 
response elicited by presenting each sound element sepa- 
rately. Combination-sensitive neurons are tuned to more 
than one frequency and are specialized to recognize com- 
plex species-specific sounds and extract information that 
is critical for survival. This sensitivity to combinations of 
simple sound elements appears to be a universal property 
of neurons for the perception of complex sounds by many 
animal species, such as frogs, birds, bats, and non-human 
primates. Therefore, combination-sensitive neurons most 
likely partake in the recognition of complex sounds in the 
human auditory cortex as well. 
Sounds that are especially important for intraspecific 
communication often have a highly ordered temporal 
structure. In humans, the best example of such time-vary- 
ing signals is speech, where different phonetic sequences 
are perceived as distinct syllables and words (see Box 27A). 
Behavioral studies in cats and monkeys show that the audi- 
tory cortex is especially important for processing temporal 
sequences of sound. If the auditory cortex is ablated in these 
animals, they lose the ability to discriminate between two 
complex sounds that have the same frequency components 
but differ in temporal sequence. Thus, without the auditory 
cortex, monkeys cannot discriminate one conspecific com- 
munication sound from another. The physiological basis of 
such temporal sensitivity likely requires neurons that are 
sensitive to time-varying cues in communication sounds. 
Indeed, electrophysiological recordings from the primary 
auditory cortices of both marmosets and bats show that 
some neurons that respond to intraspecific communica- 
tion sounds do not respond as strongly when the sounds 
are played in reverse, indicating sensitivity to the sounds' 
temporal features. Studies of human patients with bilateral 
damage to the auditory cortex also reveal severe problems 
in processing the temporal order of sounds. It seems likely, 
therefore, that specific regions of the human auditory cortex 
are specialized for processing elementary speech sounds, as 
well as other temporally complex acoustical signals, such 
as music (see Box 13B). Thus, Wernicke's area, which is 
THE AUDITORY SYSTEM 
301 
critical to the comprehension of human language, is con- 
tiguous with the secondary auditory area (see Figure 13.15 
and Chapter 27). 
Summary 
Sound waves are transmitted via the external and middle 
ear to the cochlea of the inner ear, which exhibits a travel- 
ing wave when stimulated. For high-frequency sounds, the 
amplitude of the traveling wave reaches a maximum at the 
base of the cochlea; for low-frequency sounds, the traveling 
wave reaches a maximum at the apical end. The associated 
motions of the basilar membrane are transduced primarily 
by the inner hair cells, while the basilar membrane motion 
is itself actively modulated by the outer hair cells. Damage 
to the outer or middle ear results in conductive hearing loss, 
while hair-cell damage results in a sensorineural hearing 
deficit. The tonotopic organization of the cochlea is retained 
at all levels of the central auditory system. Projections from 
the cochlea travel via the auditory nerve to the three main 
divisions of the cochlear nucleus. The targets of the cochlear 
nucleus neurons include the superior olivary complex and 
nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, where the binaural cues for 
sound localization are processed. The inferior colliculus, the 
target of nearly all of the auditory pathways in the lower 
brainstem, carries out important integrative functions, such 
as processing of sound frequencies and integration of the 
cues for localizing sound in space. The primary auditory 
cortex, which is also organized tonotopically, supports ba- 
sic auditory functions, such as frequency discrimination 
and sound localization, and also plays an important role 
in processing of intraspecific communication sounds. The 
belt areas of the auditory cortex, which have a less strict 
tonotopic organization, also process complex sounds, such 
as those that mediate communication. In the human brain, 
the major speech comprehension areas reside in the zone 
immediately adjacent to the auditory cortex.

THE VESTIBULAR 
SYSTEM 
Overview 
THE VESTIBULAR SYSTEM PROCESSES sensory information underlying motor 
responses to (and perceptions of) self-motion, head position, and spatial orientation 
relative to gravity, helping to stabilize gaze, head, and posture. The peripheral por- 
tion of the vestibular system includes inner ear structures that function as an inertial 
guidance device made up of small linear accelerometers and angular velocity sensors, 
continually reporting information about the motions and position of the head to 
integrative centers in the brainstem, cerebellum, and somatic sensory cortices. The 
central portion of the system includes the vestibular nuclei, which make extensive 
connections with brainstem and cerebellar structures. The vestibular nuclei also in- 
nervate motor neurons controlling extraocular, cervical, and postural muscles, thus 
mediating stabilization of gaze, head orientation, and posture during movement. 
Interestingly, the vestibular nuclei also receive visual input, resulting in multisensory 
integration at the earliest point in central vestibular processing. Although we are 
normally unaware of its functioning, the vestibular system is a key component in 
postural reflexes and eye movements and, in concert with the visual system, plays 
a central role in our perception of spatial orientation. In summary, the vestibular 
system gives rise to a "sixth sense" that is critical both to automatic behaviors and 
to perception, with the consequence that balance, gaze stabilization during head 
movement, and sense of orientation in space are all adversely affected if the system 
is damaged. 
The Vestibular Labyrinth 
The main peripheral component of the vestibular system is an elaborate set of in- 
terconnected chambers—the labyrinth—that has much in common, and is in fact 
continuous with, the cochlea (see Chapter 13). Like the cochlea, the labyrinth is 
derived from the otic placode of the embryo and uses the same specialized set of 
sensory cells—hair cells—to transduce physical motion into neural impulses. In the 
cochlea, the motion arises from airborne sound stimuli; in the labyrinth, the pertinent 
motions arise from the effects of gravity and from linear and rotational accelerations 
of the head.

The labyrinth is buried deep in the temporal bone and 
consists of the two otolith organs (the utricle and saccule) 
and three semicircular canals (Figure 14.1). The elaborate 
architecture of these components explains why this part of 
the vestibular system is called the labyrinth. The utricle and 
saccule are specialized primarily to respond to linear ac- 
celerations of the head and static head position relative 
to the gravitational axis, whereas the semicircular canals, 
as their shapes suggest, are specialized for responding to 
rotational accelerations of the head (Box 14A). 
The intimate relationship between the cochlea and the 
labyrinth goes beyond their common embryonic origin. In- 
deed, the cochlear and vestibular spaces are actually joined 
(see Figure 14.1), and the specialized ionic environments of

the vestibular end organ are much like those of the cochlea. 
The membranous sacs within the bone are filled with fluid 
(endolymph) and are collectively called the membranous 
labyrinth. Between the bony walls (the osseous labyrinth) 
and the membranous labyrinth is another fluid, the peri- 
lymph, which is similar in composition to cerebrospinal 
fluid (see Chapter 13). The vestibular hair cells are located 
in the utricle and saccule and in three juglike swellings 
called ampullae, located at the base of the semicircular 
canals next to the utricle. As in the cochlea, tight junctions 
seal the apical surfaces of the vestibular hair cells, ensur- 
ing that endolymph selectively bathes the hair cell bundle 
while remaining separate from the perilymph surrounding 
the basal portion of the hair cell.

basic terminology of classical mechan- 
ics. All bodies moving in three dimen-

rotational. The translational compo- 
nents may be given in terms of move- 
ments along x-, y-, and z-axes of the 
head, which form a right-handed coor- 
dinate system for the head. The otoliths 
detect acceleration along all three axes 
as well as tilts of the head relative to 
gravity. Rotation of the head about 
these axes activates the semicircular 
canals, which are responsible for sens- 
ing rotational or angular accelerations 
of the head. Rotations about the x-, y-, 
and z-axes are commonly referred to 
as roll, pitch, and yaw. The positive

Vestibular Hair Cells 
The vestibular hair cells, which, like cochlear hair cells, 
transduce minute displacements into behaviorally relevant 
receptor potentials, provide the basis for vestibular func- 
tion. Vestibular and auditory hair cells are quite similar; 
Chapter 13 gave a detailed description of hair cell struc- 
ture and function. As in the case of auditory hair cells, 
movement of the stereocilia toward the kinocilium in the 
vestibular end organs opens mechanically gated transduc- 
tion channels located at the tips of the stereocilia, depo- 
larizing the hair cell and causing neurotransmitter release 
onto (and excitation of) the vestibular nerve fibers (Fig- 
ure 14.2A,B). Movement of the stereocilia in the direction 
away from the kinocilium closes the channels, hyperpolar- 
izing the hair cell and thus reducing vestibular nerve activ- 
ity. The biphasic nature of the receptor potential means 
that some transduction channels are open in the absence 
of stimulation, with the result that hair cells tonically re- 
lease transmitter, thereby generating considerable spon- 
taneous activity in vestibular nerve fibers (see Figure 14.6). 
One consequence of these spontaneous action potentials 
is that the firing rates of vestibular fibers can increase or

decrease in a manner that faithfully mimics the receptor 
potentials produced by the hair cells (Box 14B), 
Importantly, the hair cell bundles in each vestibular or- 
gan have specific orientations (Figure 14.2C). As a result, 
the organ as a whole is responsive to displacements in all 
directions. In a given semicircular canal, the hair cells in the 
ampulla are all polarized in the same direction. In the utricle 
and saccule, a specialized area called the striola divides the 
hair cells into two populations having opposing polarities 
(see Figures 14.2C and 14.4C). The directional polarization 
of the receptor surfaces is a principle of organization in the 
vestibular system, as will become apparent in the following 
descriptions of the individual vestibular organs. 
FIGURE 14.2

CHAPTER 14 
BOX 14B Adaptation and Tuning of Vestibular Hair Cells 
_ Hair Cell Adaptation 
_ The minuscule movement of the hair 
bundle at sensory threshold has been 
_ compared to the displacement of the. 
_ top of the Eiffel Tower by a thumb's 
_ breadth. Despite its great sensitivity, the 
hair cell can adapt quickly and continu- 
- ously to static displacements of the hair 
bundle caused by large movements. 
Such adjustments are especially useful 
_ in the otolith organs, where adaptation 
_ permits hair cells to maintain sensitivity 
to small linear and angular accelera- 
_ tions of the head despite the constant 
_ input from gravitational forces that are 
over a million times greater. 
In other receptor cells, such as pho- 
_ toreceptors, adaptation is accomplished 
by regulating the second messenger 
cascade induced by the initial transduc- 
tion event. The hair cell has to depend 
on a different strategy, however, 
_ because there is no second messenger 
system between the initial transduc- 
tion event and the subsequent recep- 
tor potential (as might be expected for 
receptors that respond so rapidly). 
Adaptation occurs in both directions 
in which the hair bundle displacement 
generates a receptor potential, albeit at 
different rates for each direction. When 
the hair bundle is pushed toward the 
kinocilium, tension is initially increased 
(A) 
_\— Stereocilium 
\ Stereociliary 
pivot 
in the gating spring. During adapta- 
tion, tension decreases back to the 
resting level, perhaps because one end 
of the gating spring repositions itself 
along the shank of the stereocilium. 
When the hair bundle is displaced 
in the opposite direction, away from 
the kinocilium, tension in the spring 
initially decreases; adaptation then 
involves an increase in spring tension. 
One theory is that a calcium-regulated 
motor such as a myosin ATPase climbs 
along actin filaments in the stereocilium 
and actively resets the tension in the 
transduction spring (Figure A). During 
sustained depolarization, some Ca** 
enters through the transduction chan- 
nel, along with K*. Ca** then causes the 
motor to spend a greater fraction of its 
time unbound from the actin, resulting 
in slippage of the spring down the side 
of the stereocilium. During sustained 
hyperpolarization, Ca** levels drop 
below normal resting levels, and the 
motor spends more of its time bound 
to the actin, thus climbing up the actin 
filaments and increasing the spring ten- 
sion. As tension increases, some of the 
previously closed transduction channels 
open, admitting Ca** and thus slowing 
the motor's progress until a balance is 
struck between the climbing and slip- 
ping of the motor. In support of this 
model, when internal Ca* is reduced 
artificially, spring tension increases. 
This model of hair cell adaptation pres- 
ents an elegant molecular solution to 
the regulation of a mechanical process. 
Electrical Tuning 
Although mechanical tuning plays an 
important role in generating frequency 
selectivity in the cochlea, other mecha- 
nisms contribute to this process in ves- 
tibular and auditory nerve cells. These 
other tuning mechanisms are especially 
important in the otolith organs, where, 
unlike the cochlea, no obvious macro- 
mechanical resonances selectively filter 
and/or enhance biologically relevant 
movements. One such mechanism is 
an electrical resonance displayed by 
hair cells in response to depolarization: 
the membrane potential of a hair cell 
undergoes damped sinusoidal oscilla- 
tions at a specific frequency in response 
to the injection of depolarizing current 
pulses (Figure B). 
(A) Adaptation is explained in the gating spring model by adjustment of the insertion 
point of tip links. Movement of the insertion point up or down the shank of the stereo- 
cilium, perhaps driven by a Ca**-dependent protein motor, can continually adjust the 
resting tension of the tip link. (After Hudspeth and Gillespie, 1994.)

The ionic mechanism of this process 
involves two major types of ion chan- 
nels located in the membrane of the 
hair-cell soma. The first of these is a 
voltage-activated Ca?* conductance, 
which lets Ca** into the cell soma in 
response to depolarization, such as 
that generated by the transduction cur- 
rent. The second is a Ca**-activated K* 
conductance, which is triggered by the 
_ rise in internal Ca** concentration. The 
interplay between these two currents 
results in electrical resonance (Figure C). 
Although a hair cell responds to hair- 
bundle movement over a wide range 
of frequencies, the resultant receptor 
potential is largest at the frequency 
of electrical resonance. This electrical 
resonance has important implications 
for structures such as the utricle and

The Otolith Organs: The Utricle 
and Saccule 
The two otolith organs—the utricle and the saccule—detect 
displacements and linear accelerations of the head, such as 
those induced by tilting or translational movements (see Box 
14A). Both of these organs contain a sensory epithelium, the 
macula, which consists of hair cells and associated supporting 
cells. Overlying the hair cells and their hair bundles is a ge- 
latinous layer; above this layer is a fibrous structure, the oto- 
lithic membrane, in which are embedded crystals of calcium 
carbonate called otoconia (Figure 14.3). The crystals give the 
otolith organs their name (otolith is Greek for "ear stones"). 
The otoconia make the otolithic membrane heavier than the 
structures and fluids surrounding it; thus, when the head tilts,

the otoconia in the direction of the gravitational force along the

referred to as the equivalent acceleration. (C) Orientation of the

tation of the kinocilia, as in Figure 14.2. The saccules on either 
side are oriented more or less vertically, and the utricles more or 
less horizontally. The striola is a structural landmark consisting 
of small otoconia arranged in a narrow trench that divides each 
otolith organ. In the utricular macula, the kinocilia are directed 
toward the striola. In the saccular macula, the kinocilia point 
away from the striola. Note that, given the utricle and sacculus 
on both sides of the body, there is a continuous representation 
of all directions of head movement.

gravity causes the membrane to shift relative to the sensory 
epithelium (Figure 14.4A,B). The resulting shearing motion 
between the otolithic membrane and the macula displaces the 
hair bundles, which are embedded in the lower, gelatinous 
surface of the membrane. This displacement of the hair bun- 
dles generates a receptor potential in the hair cells. A shear- 
ing motion between the macula and the otolithic membrane 
also occurs when the head undergoes linear accelerations (see 
Figure 14.5); the greater relative mass of the otolithic mem- 
brane causes it to lag behind the macula temporarily, leading 
to transient displacement of the hair bundle. 
One consequence of the similar effects exerted on oto- 
lithic hair cells by certain head tilts and linear accelerations 
is that otolith afferents cannot convey information that 
distinguishes between these two types of stimuli. Conse- 
quently, one might expect that these different stimuli would 
be rendered perceptually equivalent when visual feedback 
is absent, as occurs in the dark or when the eyes are closed. 
Nevertheless, blindfolded subjects can discriminate be- 
tween these two stimulus categories, a feat that depends on 
the brain's ability to integrate information from the otolith 
organs and the semicircular canals. 
As already mentioned, the orientation of the hair cell 
bundles is organized relative to the striola, which demar- 
cates the overlying layer of otoconia (see Figure 14.4A). The 
striola forms an axis of mirror symmetry such that hair cells 
on opposite sides of the striola have opposing morphological 
polarizations. Thus, a tilt along the axis of the striola will ex- 
cite the hair cells on one side while inhibiting the hair cells on 
the other side. The saccular macula is oriented vertically and

the utricular macula horizontally, with a continuous variation 
in the morphological polarization of the hair cells located in 
each macula (as shown in Figure 14.4C, where the black ar- 
rows indicate the direction of movement that produces exci- 
tation). Inspection of the excitatory orientations in the macu- 
lae indicates that the utricle responds to movements of the 
head in the horizontal plane, such as sideways head tilts and 
rapid lateral displacements, whereas the saccule responds 
to movements in the vertical plane (upward—downward and 
forward—backward movements in the sagittal plane). 
Note that the saccular and utricular maculae on one side 
of the head are mirror images of those on the other side. 
Thus, a tilt of the head to one side has opposite effects on 
corresponding hair cells of the two utricular maculae. This 
concept is important in understanding how the central con- 
nections of the vestibular periphery mediate the interaction 
of inputs from the two sides of the head.

How Otolith Neurons Sense Tilts and 
Linear Accelerations of the Head 
The structure of the otolith organs enables them to sense 
both static displacements, as would be caused by tilting the 
head relative to the gravitational axis, and transient dis- 
placements caused by translational movements of the head. 
Figure 14.5 illustrates some of the forces produced by head 
tilt and linear accelerations on the utricular macula. 
The mass of the otolithic membrane relative to the sur- 
rounding endolymph, as well as the otolithic membrane's 
physical uncoupling from the underlying macula, means

(After Goldberg and Fernandez, 1976.) 
that hair bundle displacement will occur transiently in re- 
sponse to linear accelerations, and tonically in response to 
tilting of the head. The resulting hair bundle displacements 
are reflected in the responses of the vestibular nerve fibers 
that innervate the otolith organs. As mentioned, these nerve 
fibers have a steady and relatively high firing rate when the 
head is upright. Figure 14.6 shows these responses recorded 
from an otolith afferent fiber, or axon, in a monkey seated in 
a chair that could be tilted for several seconds to produce a 
steady force. Prior to the tilt, the axon has a high firing rate, 
which increases or decreases depending on the direction 
of the tilt. Notice also that the response remains at a high 
level as long as the tilting force remains constant; thus, such 
neurons faithfully encode the static force being applied to 
the head (Figure 14.6A). When the head is returned to the 
original position, the firing level of the neurons returns to 
baseline value. Conversely, when the tilt is in the opposite 
direction, the neurons respond by decreasing their firing 
rate below the resting level (Figure 14.6B) and remain de- 
pressed as long as the static force continues. In a similar 
fashion, transient increases or decreases in firing rate from 
spontaneous levels signal the direction of linear accelera- 
tions of the head. 
The range of orientations of hair bundles within the 
otolith organs enables them to transmit information about 
linear forces in every direction the head might move (see 
Figure 14.4C). The utricle, which is primarily concerned 
with motion in the horizontal plane, and the saccule, which 
is concerned with vertical motion, combine to effectively 
gauge the linear forces acting on the head at any instant, in 
three dimensions. Tilts of the head off the horizontal plane 
_ and translational movements of the head in any direction 
stimulate a distinct subset of hair cells in the saccular and 
utricular maculae, while simultaneously suppressing the 
responses of other hair cells in these organs. Ultimately, 
variations in hair cell polarity within the otolith organs 
produce patterns of vestibular nerve fiber activity that, at a 
population level, unambiguously encode head position and 
the forces that influence it. 
The Semicircular Canals 
Whereas the otolith organs are primarily concerned with 
head translations and orientation with respect to grav- 
ity, the semicircular canals sense head rotations, arising 
either from self-induced movements or from angular ac- 
celerations of the head imparted by external forces, such 
as a merry-go-round. Each of the three semicircular canals 
has at its base a bulbous expansion—the ampulla—that 
houses the sensory epithelium, or crista, that contains the 
hair cells (Figure 14.7). The structure of the canals suggests 
how they detect the angular accelerations that arise through 
rotation of the head. The hair bundles extend out of the 
crista into a gelatinous mass, the cupula, that bridges the 
width of the ampulla, forming a viscous barrier through 
which endolymph cannot circulate. As a result, the rela- 
tively compliant cupula is distorted by movements of the 
endolymphatic fluid. When the head turns in the plane of 
one of the semicircular canals, the inertia of the endolymph 
produces a force across the cupula, distending it away from 
the direction of head movement and causing a displace- 
ment of the hair bundles within the crista (Figure 14.8A,B). 
In contrast, linear accelerations of the head produce equal 
forces on the two sides of the cupula, so the hair bundles 
are not displaced. 
Unlike the saccular and utricular maculae, all of the hair 
cells in the crista within each semicircular canal are orga- 
nized with their kinocilia pointing in the same direction

FIGURE 14.7 
The ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal. The crista, 
hair bundles, and cupula are diagrammed. When the head rotates, fluid in the 
membranous canal distorts the cupula. 
(see Figure 14.2C). Thus, when the cupula moves in the appropriate 
direction, the entire population of hair cells is depolarized and activity in 
all of the innervating axons increases. When the cupula moves in the op- 
posite direction, the population is hyperpolarized and neuronal activity 
decreases. Deflections orthogonal to the excitatory-inhibitory direction 
produce little or no response. 
Each semicircular canal works in concert with the partner located on 
the other side of the head that has its hair cells aligned oppositely. There 
are three such pairs: the two pairs of horizontal canals, and the superior 
canal on each side working with the posterior canal on the other side 
(Figure 14.8C). Head rotation deforms the cupula in opposing directions 
for the two partners, resulting in opposite changes in their firing rates. 
Thus, the orientation of the horizontal canals makes them selectively 
sensitive to rotation in the horizontal plane. More specifically, the hair 
cells in the canal toward which the head is turning are depolarized, while 
those on the other side are hyperpolarized. 
For example, when the head accelerates to the left, the cupula is 
pushed toward the kinocilium in the left horizontal canal, and the firing 
rate of the relevant axons in the left vestibular nerve increases. In con- 
trast, the cupula in the right horizontal canal is pushed away from the 
kinocilium, with a concomitant decrease 
in the firing rate of the related neurons. 
If the head movement is to the right, the 
result is just the opposite. This push-pull 
arrangement operates for all three pairs of 
canals; the pair whose activity is modu- 
lated is in the plane of the rotation, and 
the member of the pair whose activity is 
increased is on the side toward which the 
head is turning. The net result is a system 
that provides information about the rota- 
tion of the head in any direction.

CHAPTER 14 
How Semicircular Canal Neurons 
Sense Angular Accelerations 
Like axons that innervate the otolith organs, the vestibular 
fibers that innervate the semicircular canals exhibit a high 
level of spontaneous activity. As a result, they can transmit 
information by either increasing or decreasing their firing 
rate, thus more effectively encoding head movements (see 
above). The bidirectional responses of fibers innervating the 
hair cells of the semicircular canal have been studied by 
recording the axonal firing rates in a monkey's vestibular 
nerve. Seated in a chair, the monkey was rotated continu- 
ously in one direction during three phases: an initial period 
of acceleration, then a period of several seconds at con- 
stant velocity, and finally a period of sudden deceleration 
to a stop (Figure 14.9), The maximum firing rates observed 
correspond to the period of acceleration, when the cupula

FIGURE 14.9 
Response of a vestibular nerve axon from 
the semicircular canal to angular acceleration. The stimulus 
(top) is a rotation that first accelerates, then maintains constant 
velocity, and then decelerates the head. The stimulus-evoked 
change in firing rate of this vestibular unit (bottom) reflects 
the fact that the endolymph has viscosity and inertia and that 
the cupola has elasticity. Thus, during the initial acceleration, 
the deflection of the cupula causes the unit activity to rapidly 
increase. During constant angular velocity, the cupula returns to 
its non-deflected state over a time course related to its elasticity 
and the viscosity of the fluid, and the unit activity returns to the 
baseline rate. During deceleration, the cupula is deflected in the 
opposite direction, causing a transient decrease in the unit firing 
rate. This behavior can be thought of as the cupula~endolymph 
system dynamic; the inertia of the fluid plays a minor role in this 
dynamic, coming into play only at very high frequencies of head 
movement. (After Goldberg and Fernandez, 1971.) 
is deflected; the maximum inhibition corresponds to the 
period of deceleration, when the cupula is deflected in the 
opposite direction. During the constant-velocity phase, fir- 
ing rates return to a baseline level as the cupula returns to 
its non-deflected state over a time course that is related to 
the cupular elasticity and the viscosity of the endolymph 
(about 15 seconds). Note that the time it takes the cupula 
to return to its undistorted state (and for the hair bundles 
to return to their undeflected position) can occur while the 
head is still turning, as long as a constant angular veloc- 
ity is maintained. Such constant forces are rarely found in 
nature, although they are encountered aboard ships, air- 
planes, space vehicles, and amusement park rides, where 
prolonged acceleratory arcs can occur. 
An interesting aspect of the cupula-endolymph system 
dynamic is that it "smooths" the transduction of head ac- 
celerations into neural signals. For example, when the head 
is accelerated to a constant velocity rather rapidly (corre- 
sponding to high-frequency rotational movements of the 
head), vestibular units associated with the affected canal 
generate a velocity signal; note that the axon firing rate 
in Figure 14.9 rises linearly during the acceleration phase. 
However, when the head is moving at a constant angular 
velocity (i.e., low-frequency rotational movements), the rate 
decays to the spontaneous level (corresponding to an ac- 
celeration of zero). This transduction process results in a 
velocity signal at high frequencies and an acceleration sig- 
nal at low frequencies, a behavior that can be seen clearly 
in response to sinusoidal stimuli applied over a wide fre- 
quency range. 
Central Pathways for Stabilizing 
Gaze, Head, and Posture 
The vestibular system contributes to rapid automatic be- 
haviors, such as reflexive eye movements that stabilize gaze 
and rapid postural adjustments to maintain balance, and 
also to higher order processes that are important to our 
sense of spatial orientation and self-motion. The organiza- 
tion of the central vestibular pathways reflects this multi- 
functional role; these pathways also display two features 
that distinguish them from the pathways that convey in- 
formation important to sight, hearing, 'and touch. First, cen- 
tral vestibular processing is inherently multisensory, because 
many neurons in the vestibular nucleithe earliest point in 
central vestibular processing—receive visual input. Second, 
many neurons in the vestibular nuclei function as premotor neu- 
rons in addition to giving rise to ascending sensory projections, 
providing a very short-latency sensorimotor arc that can 
drive extremely rapid (~5 ms) compensatory eye and head 
movements in response to vestibular stimulation: 
The vestibular end organs communicate, via the ves- 
tibular branch of cranial nerve VIII, with targets in the 
brainstem and the cerebellum that process much of the 

information necessary to compute head position and mo- 
tion. As with the cochlear nerve, the vestibular nerves 
arise from a population of bipolar neurons, the cell bodies 
of which in this instance reside in the vestibular nerve 
ganglion (also called Scarpa's ganglion; see Figure 14.1). 
The distal processes of these cells innervate the semicircular 
canals and the otolith organs, while the central processes 
project via the vestibular portion of cranial nerve VIII to 
the vestibular nuclei (and also directly to the cerebellum; 
Figure 14.10). Although the canal and otolith afferents are 
largely segregated in the periphery, a large amount of ca- 
nal—otolith convergence is found in the vestibular nuclei, a 
feature that ultimately enables the unambiguous encoding 
of orientation (such as head tilts) and motion through the 
environment. The vestibular nuclei are important centers of 
integration, receiving input from the vestibular nuclei of the

opposite side as well as from the cerebellum and the visual 
and somatic sensory systems. 
The central projections of the vestibular system partici- 
pate in two major classes of reflexes: (1) those responsible 
for maintaining equilibrium and gaze during movement, and 
(2) those responsible for maintaining posture. The first helps 
coordinate head and eye movements to keep the gaze fixed 
on objects of interest during movement. (Other functions 
include protective or escape reactions; see Box 14D.) The 
vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in particular is a mechanism 
for producing eye movements that counter head movements, 
thus permitting the gaze to remain fixed on a particular point 
(Box 14C; see also Chapter 20). For example, activity in the 
left horizontal canal induced by leftward rotary acceleration 
of the head excites neurons in the left vestibular nucleus and 
results in compensatory eye movements to the right. 
Figure 14.10 illustrates the circuits mediating this reflex. 
Vestibular nerve fibers originating in the left horizontal 
semicircular canal project to the medial and lateral ves- 
tibular nuclei. Excitatory fibers from the medial vestibular 
nucleus cross to the contralateral abducens nucleus, which 
has two outputs. One of these is a motor pathway that 
causes the lateral rectus of the right eye to contract; the 
other is an excitatory projection that crosses the midline 
and ascends via the medial longitudinal 
fasciculus to the left oculomotor nucleus, 
where it activates neurons that cause the 
medial rectus of the left eye to contract. 
Finally, inhibitory neurons project from 
the medial vestibular nucleus to the left 
abducens nucleus, directly causing the 
motor drive on the lateral rectus of the left 
eye to decrease and also indirectly causing 
the right medial rectus to relax. The con- 
sequence of these several connections is 
FIGURE 14.10.

eral abducens nucleus are inhibitory (black). 
There are connections from the oculomotor 
nucleus to the medial rectus of the left eye 
and from the abducens nucleus to the lateral 
rectus of the right eye. This circuit moves the 
eyes to the right, that is, in the direction away 
from the left horizontal canal, when the head 
rotates to the left. Turning to the right, which 
causes increased activity in the right horizon- 
tal canal, has the opposite effect on eye move- 
ments. The projections from the right vestibu- 
lar nucleus are omitted for clarity.

that excitatory input from the horizontal canal on one side 
produces eye movements toward the opposite side. There- 
fore, turning the head to the left causes eye movements to 
the right. In a similar fashion, head turns in other planes 
activate other semicircular canals, causing other appropriate 
compensatory eye movements. Thus, the VOR also plays 
an important role in vertical gaze stabilization in response 
to the linear vertical head oscillations that accompany lo- 
comotion and in response to vertical angular accelerations 
of the head, as can occur when riding on a swing. In the

CHAPTER 14 
BOX 14D Mauthner Cells in Fish 
_ A primary function of the vestibular 
_ system is to provide information about 
_ the direction and speed of ongoing 
_ movements, ultimately enabling rapid, 
_ coordinated reflexes to compensate for 
_ both self-induced and externally gener- 
ated forces. One of the most impres- 
_ sive and speediest vestibular-mediated 
reflexes is the tail-flip escape behavior 
_ of fish (and larval amphibians), a ste- 
reotyped response that allows a poten- 
_ tial prey to elude its predators (Figure 
A; tap on the side of a fish tank if you 
- want to observe the reflex). In response 
_ to a perceived risk, fish flick their tail 
and are thus propelled laterally away 
_ from the approaching threat. 
The circuitry underlying the tail-flip 
escape reflex includes a pair of giant 
- medullary neurons called Mauthner 
cells, their vestibular inputs, and the 
spinal cord motor neurons to which 
the Mauthner cells project. (Most fish 
_ possess one pair of Mauthner cells in 
a stereotypic location. Thus, these cells 
can be consistently visualized and stud- 
ied from animal to animal.) Movements 
in the water, such as might be caused 
(A) 
by an approaching predator, excite 
saccular hair cells in the vestibular 
labyrinth. These receptor potentials are 
transmitted via the central processes of 
vestibular ganglion cells in cranial nerve 
VIII to the two Mauthner cells in the 
brainstem. As in the vestibulo-spinal 
pathway in humans, the Mauthner cells 
project directly to spinal motor neurons. 
The small number of synapses inter- 
vening between the receptor cells and 
the motor neurons is one of the ways 
that this circuit has been optimized for 
speed by natural selection, an arrange- 
ment evident in humans as well. The 
large size of the Mauthner axons is 
another; the axons from these cells ina 
goldfish are about 50 um in diameter. 
The optimization for speed and 
direction in the escape reflex also is 
reflected in the synapses vestibular 
nerve afferents make on each Mauthner 
cell (Figure B). These connections are 
electrical synapses that allow rapid and 
faithful transmission of the vestibular 
signal. 
An appropriate direction for escape 
is promoted by two features: (1) each 
Mauthner cell projects only to con- 
tralateral motor neurons; and (2) a 
local network of bilaterally projecting 
interneurons inhibits activity in the 
Mauthner cell away from the side on 
which the vestibular activity originates. 
In this way, the Mauthner cell on one 
side faithfully generates action poten- 
tials that command contractions of con- 
tralateral tail musculature, thus moving 
the fish out of the path of the oncoming 
predator. Conversely, the local inhibi- 
tory network silences the Mauthner 
cell on the opposite side during the 
response (Figure C). 
The Mauthner cells in fish are analo- 
gous to the reticulo-spinal and vestibu- 
lo-spinal pathways that control balance, 
posture, and orienting movements in 
mammals. The equivalent behavioral 
responses in humans are evident ina 
friendly game of tag, or more serious 
escape endeavors.

orientations of a fish engaging in a tail-

clinic, caloric testing provides a useful way to activate the 
VOR without moving the head, and it is a valuable tool for 
diagnosing peripheral and central lesions to the vestibular 
system (see Box 14C). 
Loss of the VOR can have severe consequences. A pa- 
tient with vestibular damage finds it difficult or impossible 
to fixate on visual targets while the head is moving, a condi- 
tion called oscillopsia ("bouncing vision"). If the damage 
is unilateral, the patient usually recovers the ability to fixate 
objects during head movements. However, a patient with 
bilateral loss of vestibular function has the persistent and 
disturbing sense that the world is moving when the head 
moves. The underlying problem in such cases is that infor- 
mation about head movements normally generated by the 
vestibular organs is not available to the oculomotor centers, 
so that compensatory eye movements cannot be made. 
Descending projections from the vestibular nuclei are es- 
sential for postural adjustments of the head, mediated by 
the vestibulo-cervical reflex (VCR), and body, mediated by 
the vestibulo-spinal reflex (VSR). As with the VOR, these 
postural reflexes are extremely fast, in part due to the small 
number of synapses interposed between the vestibular organ 
and the relevant motor neurons (Box 14D). Like the VOR, 
the VCR and the VSR are both compromised in patients with 
bilateral damage to the vestibular periphery. Such patients 
exhibit diminished head and postural stability, resulting in 
gait deviations; they also have difficulty balancing. These bal- 
ance defects become more pronounced in low light or while

is the product of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs. 
The anatomical substrate for the VCR involves the medial 
vestibular nucleus; axons from this nucleus descend in the 
medial longitudinal fasciculus to reach the upper cervical lev- 
els of the spinal cord (Figure 14.11). This pathway regulates 
head position by reflex activity of neck muscles in response 
to stimulation of the semicircular canals caused by rotational 
accelerations of the head. For example, during a downward 
pitch of the body (e.g., tripping), the superior canals are ac- 
tivated and the head muscles reflexively pull the head up. 
The dorsal flexion of the head initiates other reflexes, such 
as forelimb extension and hindlimb flexion, to stabilize the 
body and protect against a fall (see Chapter 17).

The VSR is mediated by a combination of pathways, in- 
cluding the lateral and medial vestibulo-spinal tracts and 
the reticulo-spinal tract. The inputs from the otolith organs 
project mainly to the lateral vestibular nucleus, which in 
turn sends axons in the lateral vestibulo-spinal tract to 
the spinal cord (see Figure 14.11). These axons terminate 
monosynaptically on extensor motor neurons, and they di- 
synaptically inhibit flexor motor neurons; the net result is a 
powerful excitatory influence on the extensor (antigravity) 
muscles. When hair cells in the otolith organs are activated, 
signals reach the medial part of the ventral horn. By activat- 
ing the ipsilateral pool of motor neurons innervating exten- 
sor muscles in the trunk and limbs, this pathway mediates 
balance and the maintenance of upright posture.

Decerebrate rigidity, characterized by rigid extension of 
the limbs, arises when the brainstem is transected above 
the level of the vestibular nucleus. Decerebrate rigidity in 
experimental animals is relieved when the vestibular nuclei 
are lesioned, underscoring the importance of the vestibular 
system to the maintenance of muscle tone. The tonic acti- 
vation of extensor muscles in decerebrate rigidity suggests 
further that descending projections from higher levels of 
the brain, especially the cerebral cortex, normally suppress 
the vestibulo-spinal pathway (see also Chapter 17). 
Vestibular Pathways to the Thalamus 
and Cortex 
In addition to these several descending projections, the su- 
perior and lateral vestibular nuclei send axons to the ventral 
posterior nuclear complex of the thalamus. This, in turn, 
projects to two cortical areas relevant to the perceptions 
arising from the processing of vestibular information (Figure 
14.12). One of these cortical targets is just posterior to the 
primary somatosensory cortex, near the representation of 
FIGURE 14.11

nuclei to the spinal cord underlie the 
VCR and VSR. The medial vestibular nuclei 
project bilaterally in the medial longitudinal 
fasciculus to reach the medial part of the 
ventral horns and mediate head reflexes in 
response to activation of semicircular canals. 
The lateral vestibular nucleus sends axons via 
the lateral vestibular tract to contact ventral 
horn cells innervating the axial and proximal 
limb muscles. Neurons in the lateral vestibular 
nucleus receive input from the cerebellum, 
allowing the cerebellum to influence posture 
and equilibrium.

the face; the other is at the transition between the somatic 
sensory cortex and the motor cortex (Brodmann's area 3a; 
see Figure 9.11). Electrophysiological studies of individual 
neurons in these areas show that the relevant cells respond 
to proprioceptive and visual stimuli as well as to vestibular 
stimuli, reflecting the multisensory nature of central ves- 
tibular processing. Many of these cortical neurons are acti- 
vated by moving visual stimuli as well as by rotation of the 
body (even with the eyes closed), suggesting that these cor- 
tical regions are involved in the perception of body orienta- 
tion in extrapersonal space. Consistent with this interpreta- 
tion, patients with lesions of the right parietal cortex suffer 
altered perception of personal and extrapersonal space, as 
discussed in greater detail in Chapter 26. 
Spatial Orientation Perception and 
Multisensory Integration 
Although the vestibular system contributes to many auto- 
matic reflexes and most of us remain unaware of its func- 
tioning unless it is damaged, it also plays an important role 
in our perception of spatial orientation and self-motion. 
Indeed, the vestibular system underlies our ability to de- 
tect the direction and magnitude of self-generated motion 
and distinguish this motion from the movement of objects 
around us. Working in concert with the visual system, the 
vestibular system provides critical information for spatial 
orientation and navigation. 
As might be expected based on the stimuli that act on 
the vestibular end organs, the vestibular system contributes 
to our perception of rotation, translation, and tilts. As with 
other percepts, these vestibular percepts do not simply mir- 
ror the physical attributes of the associated stimulus. For 
example, a blindfolded subject riding on a chair rotating at 
a constant speed will perceive that the rotation is slowing

and, after about 30 seconds, that it has stopped entirely. 
Interestingly, the time course of this perceptual decay is 
similar to, but more prolonged than, the decrement of the 
signal transmitted from the semicircular canal to the brain, 
suggesting that the brain is somehow compensating for the 
diminishing signal to generate a percept that more closely 
approximates the actual rotation. In a similar manner, the 
vestibular system also contributes to our perception of the 
direction and velocity of translational movements, as well 
as the direction and magnitude of static tilts. 
As mentioned, the vestibular and visual systems nor- 
mally work in concert to provide an estimate of self-motion. 
As we walk along a forest trail, for example, translational 
movements activate the vestibular system and also gener- 
ate visual flow across the retina. The contributions of visual 
cutaneous afferents

flow to self-motion can be very compel- 
ling, as witnessed by riders waiting for 
their train to leave the station. If a train on 
an adjacent track starts to move, the resul- 
tant visual flow generates a strong sense of 
self-motion, a perceptual process known 
as vection. More systematic tests of ves- 
tibular—visual interactions using controlled 
visual stimulation suggest that the normal 
function of the vestibular system is to sup- 
press the sense of self-generated motion 
that can arise from visual cues. Consis- 
tent with this idea, people with vestibular 
damage—as well as astronauts working in 
space, who lack gravitational cues from the 
otolith organs—report heightened vection 
in response to visual flow information. 
Summary 
The vestibular system provides informa- 
tion about the orientation of the head with 
respect to gravity and head motion. The 
sensory receptor cells are located in the 
otolith organs and the semicircular canals 
of the inner ear. The otolith organs pro- 
vide information for ocular reflexes and 
postural adjustments when the head tilts 
in various directions or undergoes linear accelerations, and 
for our perception of these tilts and translations. The semi- 
circular canals, in contrast, provide information about rota- 
tional accelerations of the head; these stimuli initiate reflex 
movements that adjust the eyes, head, and body during 
motor activities. Among the best studied of these reflexes 
are eye movements that compensate for head movements, 
thereby stabilizing the visual scene when the head moves. 
Information from the vestibular system also plays a central 
role in our perception of spatial orientation and our ability 
to navigate through the environment. Vestibular process- 
ing is inherently multisensory: Input from all the vestibular 
organs is integrated with input from the visual and somatic 
sensory systems to provide perceptions of body position 
and orientation in space.

THE CHEMICAL 
SENSES 
Overview 
THREE SENSORY SYSTEMS ARE ASSOCIATED with the nose and mouth: the 
olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), and trigeminal (chemosensory irritant) systems. 
Each of these is dedicated to the detection of chemicals in the environment. The olfac- 
tory system detects airborne molecules called odorants. In humans, odorants provide 
information about self and other people, animals and plants, as well as helping to 
identify food and noxious or hazardous substances in the environment. Olfactory in- 
formation thus influences social interactions, reproduction, defensive responses, and 
feeding behavior. The gustatory system detects ingested tastants (primarily water- or 
fat-soluble molecules), which provide information about the quality, quantity, and 
safety of ingested food. Finally, the trigeminal chemosensory system provides infor- 
mation about irritating or noxious molecules that come into contact with skin or the 
mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth. All three chemosensory systems 
rely on receptors that interact with relevant molecules in the environment. For smell 
and taste, essential aspects of sensory transduction use G-protein-coupled recep- 
tors and second-messenger-mediated signaling. Information from primary sensory 
receptors in the nose, tongue, and other mucous membranes is relayed to regions 
of the central nervous system that guide the broad range of behaviors influenced by 
chemosensation. From an evolutionary perspective, the chemical senses—particu- 
larly olfaction—are deemed to be the "oldest" or "most primitive," yet they remain 
in many ways the least understood of the sensory modalities. 
The Organization of the Olfactory System 
The olfactory system—the most thoroughly studied component of the chemosensory 
triad—processes information about the identity, concentration, and quality of a wide 
range of airborne, volatile chemical stimuli called odorants. Odorants interact with 
olfactory receptor neurons found in an epithelial sheet, the olfactory epithelium, 
that lines the interior of the nose (Figure 15.1A,B). Axons arising from receptor cells 
project directly to neurons in the olfactory bulb, which in turn sends projections to 
the pyriform cortex in the temporal lobe, as well as to other structures in the forebrain 
via an axon pathway known as the olfactory tract (Figure 15.1C,D).

orbitofrontal cortex, (2) the pyriform cortex and olfactory bulbs, 
and (3) the amygdala. Maximal focal activation in response to odor 
presentation [in this case correlated either with pleasantness (1) or 
intensity (2, 3)], is seen in the orbitofrontal and pyriform cortices as 
well as in the amygdala. (E from Rolls et al., 2003.) 

The olfactory system is unique among the sensory sys- 
tems in that it does not include a thalamic relay from pri- 
mary receptors en route to a cortical region that processes 
the sensory information. Instead, after relaying through the 
olfactory bulb, olfactory sensory information is processed in 
the pyriform cortex, a three-layered archicortex dedicated 
to olfaction and considered to be phylogenetically older than 
the six-layered neocortex. Although this initial pathway by- 
passes the thalamus, the thalamus does play an important 
role in subsequent stages of olfaction. Olfactory information 
from pyriform cortex is relayed to the thalamus en route to 
association areas in the neocortex, where further processing 
occurs (Figure 15.1C). Together, the pyriform cortex and the 
olfactory association areas of the neocortex are thought to be 
essential for the conscious appreciation of odorants as well as 
the association of odors with other sensory characteristics of 
environmental stimuli. The olfactory bulb relays information 
directly to a number of other targets in addition to the pyri- 
form cortex, including the hypothalamus and amygdala (Fig- 
ures 15.1C,D). The neural computations that occur in these 
regions influence motor, visceral, and emotional reactions to 
chemosensory stimuli, particularly those relevant to feeding, 
reproduction, and aggressive behaviors (Figure 15.1E). 
Despite its phylogenetic age and unusual trajectory to 
the cortex, the olfactory system abides by the same principle 
that governs other sensory modalities: Sensory stimuli—in 
this case, airborne chemicals—interact with receptors at 
the periphery and are transduced and encoded into electri- 
cal signals, which are transmitted to higher-order centers. 
However, less is known about the central organization of 
the olfactory system than other sensory pathways. For ex- 
ample, the somatic sensory and visual cortices described 
in the preceding chapters all feature spatial maps of the 
relevant receptor surface, and the auditory cortex features 
frequency maps. Whether analogous maps exist in the pyri- 
form cortex (or the olfactory bulb) is not yet known. Indeed, 
until recently it was difficult to imagine what sensory quali- 
ties might be represented in an ordered fashion within an 
olfactory map, or what features (or submodalities) of che- 
mosensory stimuli might be processed in parallel (as occurs 
in other sensory systems).

THE CHEMICAL SENSES 
323 
Olfactory Perception in Humans 
In humans, olfaction is often considered the least acute of 
the senses, and many animals obviously possess far supe- 
rior olfactory abilities. The greater chemosensory sophis- 
tication of such animals may be explained by increased 
numbers of olfactory receptor neurons and odorant recep- 
tor proteins in an expanded olfactory epithelium, as well 
as by a relatively larger portion of the forebrain devoted to 
olfaction (Figure 15.2). In a 70 kg human, the surface area 
of the olfactory epithelium is approximately 10 cm; in con- 
trast, a rat has 15 cm', a3 kg cat has about 20 cm', and dogs 
such as bloodhounds have 380 cm? of olfactory epithelium. 
With such a quantitative disadvantage, the human nose 
seems ill-suited for certain tasks, such as following a scent 
to a specific target, that are second nature to a cat or dog. 
Nevertheless, humans can, when challenged, use their 
somewhat modest olfactory endowment to "sniff out" a 
scent trail. Moreover, we seem to use scent-tracking strat- 
egies that are similar to our more olfactorally gifted coun- 
terparts: we pursue a tracking path that constantly bisects 
the linear scent trail (Figure 15.3A,B); we sniff frequently; 
sniffing increases as scent tracking is learned; and our per- 
formance improves with practice (Figure 15.3C). Thus, al- 
though humans do not rely on olfaction as a major source 
of spatial information, the human olfactory system has the 
capacity to use chemosensory information to track targets 
and locate items of interest in space. 
Humans are also quite good at detecting and identifying 
individual airborne odorants with a wide range of aesthetic 
(unpleasant/pleasant) and behavioral (irritant/attractant) 
significance. Ozone (the smell that accompanies lightning 
and electrical arcing) becomes an irritant above relatively

Humans can track scents at low concentra-

scent trail established by dragging a pheasant through a field 
(the pheasant, immobilized, is seen at the bottom of the pic- 
ture), The red line indicates the path of a pointer tracking the

sions, which are common for a new scent present at relatively 
low concentrations in a complex odor environment. (B) The yel-

training period, humans can acquire greater skill and accu- 
racy tracking a scent at low concentrations (black trace). This 
improvement indicates that the olfactory system has the capac- 
ity for enhanced performance, perhaps by increased sensitivity 
to a learned signal over background "odor noise." Humans also 
acquire greater speed in tracking scents at low concentration 
over a small number of trials (red trace). Apparently, olfactory 
sensation, like other sensory modalities, can be used in complex 
tasks in which performance speed as well as accuracy can be 
enhanced by repetition. (After Porter et al., 2007.) 
low concentrations. The human olfactory system can detect 
ozone reliably at approximately 10 molecules per billion in 
room air. Similarly, humans can identify p-limonene, the 
major element of citrus smells, fairly reliably at 15 molecules 
per billion in room air (Figure 15.4A). Other molecules are 
detected only at much higher concentrations. For example, 
some estimates place human sensitivity to the odor of etha- 
nol at 2000 molecules per billion. 
A further complication in rationalizing the perception 
of odors is that their quality may change with odorant 
concentration. For example, at low concentrations the 
molecule indole has a "floral" odor, whereas at higher 
concentrations it smells "putrid" (Figure 15.4B). The hu- 
man olfactory system is also capable of making percep- 
tual distinctions based on small changes in molecular 
structure; for example, the molecule p-carvone smells like 
spearmint, whereas L-carvone smells like the caraway 
seeds found in rye bread (Figure 15.4C). 
There have been many attempts to classify odors into 
categories that parallel the division of the visible light spec- 
trum into red, blue, and green (which correspond to the 
molecular specificity of photopigments in photoreceptors). 
Despite these efforts, there is no indication that any cur- 
rently available arbitrary scheme reflects biologically signifi- 
cant categories of odorants. However, one of the most con- 
sistent aspects of olfactory perception is the classification of 
odors as either pleasant and attractive or unpleasant and 
repulsive. These basic properties of olfactory stimuli—their 
"aesthetic" qualities (or lack thereof)—are apparently rep- 
resented in distinct cortical regions that mediate olfactory 
perception (Figure 15.4D). This suggests that perceived aes- 
thetic properties of odorants have distinct representations 
in the forebrain, including in distinct regions of the cerebral 
cortex. Most naturally occurring odors, however, are blends 
of several odorant molecules, even though they are typically 
experienced as a single smell (such as the perceptions elic- 
ited by perfumes or the bouquet of a wine). Thus, it remains 
to be determined whether animals "map" odors or their 
attractive or repellent qualities based on single perceptual 
attributes. 
Assessing Olfactory Function 
in the Laboratory or Clinic 
Most people are able to consistently identify a broad 
range of odorants, and they can distinguish distinct odors 
from one another. Indeed, many clinicians use uniquely 
scented "probes"—such as coffee grounds or soap—to test 
the function of the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I) as part 
of the standard cranial nerve examination. But some indi- 
viduals consistently fail to identify one or more common 
odors (Figure 15.5A). Such chemosensory deficits, known as 
anosmias, are often restricted to a single odorant, suggest- 
ing that a specific element in the olfactory system—either

where room air is presented in precise mixtures with single odors, the 
threshold for detection reflects the concentration at which a human subject 
correctly identifies the presence of the odor above chance (50%). Subjects 
can detect ozone, a somewhat unpleasant odor, at approximately 10 parts 
per billion. The pleasant and nutritionally significant odor p-limonene can 
be identified at approximately 15 parts per billion. (B) Perception of the 
molecule indole is concentration-dependent. At low concentrations, it is per- 
ceived as a pleasant floral smell. At high concentrations, the same molecule 
(which is produced by bacteria in decomposing organic material) is experi- 
enced as putrid. (C) The p and t enatiomers of carvone produce very different

an olfactory receptor gene (see below) or genes that control 
expression or function of specific odorant receptor genes— 
is inactivated. Genetic analysis of anosmic individuals has 
yet to confirm this possibility. Thus, unlike blindness and 
deafness, olfactory loss is difficult to classify as either pe- 
ripheral or central in its origins. 
Anosmias can be congenital, or they may be acquired 
following chronic sinus infection or inflammation, trau- 
matic head injury, or exposure to toxins (Box 15A). Ol- 
factory loss is also a common consequence of aging (see 
below). In some cases, such disruption is not a source of 
great concern (for example, the transient anosmia that 
occurs with a severe cold). Nevertheless, it can diminish 
the enjoyment of food and, if sustained, can lead to de- 
creased appetite, weight loss, and eventual malnutrition 
(especially in aged individuals). If an anosmia is particu- 
larly specific and severe, it can affect the ability to identify 
and respond appropriately to potentially dangerous odors 
such as spoiled food, toxic chemicals, or smoke. Anosmias 
often target perception of distinct noxious odorants. For 
BOX 15A You Only Get One Nose 
example, approximately 1 person in 1000 is insensitive to 
butyl mercaptan, the foul-smelling odorant released by 
skunks. More serious is the inability to detect hydrogen 
cyanide (1 person in 10), which can be lethal, or ethyl mer- 
captan, the chemical added to natural gas to enable people 
to detect gas leaks. 
Like other sensory modalities, human olfactory capac- 
ity normally decreases with age. If otherwise healthy sub- 
jects are challenged to identify a large battery of common 
odorants, people 20-40 years of age can typically identify 
50-75% of the odors, whereas those between ages 50 and 
70 correctly identify only 30-45% (Figure 15.5B). These 
changes may reflect either diminished peripheral sensitivity 
or altered activity of central olfactory structures in otherwise 
healthy aging individuals. A more radically diminished or 
distorted sense of smell often accompanies neurodegen- 
erative conditions associated with aging, especially Al- 
zheimer's disease. In fact, odor discrimination (the ability 
to tell two odors apart; usually measured by a standard- 
ized "scratch and sniff" test known as the University of 
Our other specialized sensory organs— 
the eyes and ears—are the subjects of 
safety campaigns that warn against 
_ risks to sight and hearing, and a robust 
industry manufactures protective 
devices such as goggles, sunglasses, 
and ear plugs to guard against dam- 
age. Despite its prominence, the nose 
is often overlooked when it comes to 
thinking about risks and consequences.

led to two eerily similar instances of 
medically induced anosmia resulting 
from exposure of the olfactory epithe- 
lium to zinc, which can be toxic to some 
tissues. In both cases, the reasonable 
desire to prevent a perceived "greater 
evil"—polio in the 1930s and the com- 
mon cold in the 1990s—resulted in 
treatments that were not only ineffec- 
tual in respect to their original intent 
but which resulted in significant loss of

both instances, children were among 
those most affected. 
In the late 1930s, the threat of polio 
was very real, and weapons to fight 
this devastating viral disease that pref- 
erentially afflicts young children were 
limited. There was an impression that 
the poliovirus could be transmitted

part of a battery of diagnostic tests administered at the early 
Stages of age-related dementia and other neurodegenera- 
tive diseases. 
In addition to normal and pathological age-related 
changes in olfaction, olfactory sensation and perception can 
be disrupted by chemotherapy, eating disorders, diabetes, 
neurological disorders (olfaction is often compromised early 
in the course of Parkinson's disease), and psychotic disor- 
ders (especially schizophrenia). Thus, in schizophrenic pa- 
tients, olfactory hallucinations (i.e., perception of a stimulus 
that is not actually present in the environment) are among 
the earliest symptoms of psychosis. The causes of olfac- 
tory deficits in this broad range of disorders are not known. 
Some dysfunction may reflect lost capacity of the olfactory 
epithelium to maintain neural stem cells or the newly gen- 
erated neurons that normally replace damaged olfactory 
receptor neurons over the course of a lifetime (see Figure 
15.7)—perhaps an early sign of more general pathogenic 
deficits in maintenance of healthy neurons.

Physiological and Behavioral 
Responses to Odorants 
In addition to olfactory perceptions, odorants can elicit a 
variety of physiological responses. Examples are the visceral 
motor responses to the aroma of appetizing food (saliva- 
tion and increased gastric motility) or to a noxious smell 
(gagging and, in extreme cases, vomiting). Olfaction can 
also influence reproductive and endocrine functions. For 
instance, women living in single-sex dormitories tend to 
have synchronized menstrual cycles, apparently mediated 
by olfaction. Experimental evidence reinforces the reality of 
this surprising phenomenon. Volunteer women exposed to 
gauze pads from the underarms of other women at different 
stages of their menstrual cycles also experience synchro- 
nized menses, and this synchronization can be disrupted 
by exposure to analogous gauze pads from men. These re- 
sponses are thought to reflect in part detection of gender- 
specific odorants (see below). Olfaction also influences 
mother-child interactions. Infants recognize their mothers

infection). Many physicians thought 
that zinc-based nasal sprays could 
protect children from infection, even 
though there was little evidence for 
this hypothesis. Desperate times often 
lead to intemperate measures, however, 
and several zinc nasal spray treatments 
were widely administered. Among the 
most ambitious was a 1937 trial involv- 
ing 5000 children in Toronto who were 
given intranasal sprays of zinc sulfate. 
It soon became clear that the treatment 
did not prevent polio infection and, 
in a significant number of children, it 
had an unanticipated side effect—an 
irreversible loss of the sense of smell. 
_ Subsequent animal studies offered an 
explanation of this unfortunate con- 
sequence. Zinc ions cause dramatic, 
specific damage to olfactory receptor 
neurons, and elevated concentration 
or repeated exposure to zinc salts can 
almost completely destroy the olfactory 
epithelium (see the figure)—includ- 
ing, presumably, the stem cells that 
regenerate olfactory receptor neurons 
throughout life. 
Observations of zinc toxicity in 
the olfactory epithelium of animals 
(recorded in the literature as early 
as 1947), along with the unfortunate 
outcome of the 1937 Canadian trial, 
clearly raised a red flag against the fur- 
ther use of any zinc salt as an intranasal 
treatment. Alas, this was not the case. 
In the 1990s, the notion that zinc was 
an effective antiviral agent (especially 
against rhinovirus, the cause of the 
common cold) led to the reemergence 
of zinc on the market, this time in 
unregulated dietary supplements and 
homeopathic remedies. Even though 
such products generally escape the rig- 
orous oversight afforded prescription 
and over-the-counter drugs, they often 
have distinct pharmacological effects. 
Such was the case with Zicam® nasal 
gel, whose primary active ingredient 
was a zinc salt, zinc gluconate. Shortly 
after the introduction of this product, 
reports emerged of individuals losing 
their sense of smell after using it. Not 
surprisingly, zinc gluconate, like zinc 
sulfate, causes significant cellular dam- 
age to the olfactory epithelium and can 
result in permanent disruption of olfac- 
tory sensation. On the basis of the clear 
risk of permanent damage to olfaction, 
in June of 2009 the FDA issued a warn- 
ing to consumers to stop using zinc 
gluconate intranasal treatments. 
This tale of the same mistake made 
twice holds two lessons. First, although 
less attended to than sight and hearing, 
olfaction is also vulnerable to peripheral 
insults that can seriously compromise 
sensation. Second, even seemingly 
innocuous compounds can pose sig- 
nificant risks that may be known but 
not recognized due to lack of rigorous 
oversight. With these two lessons firmly 
in mind, one hopes that the future does 
not hold yet another episode of pre- 
ventable, zinc-related anosmias.

carnivores—especially components in 
urine and feces—elicit vomeronasal 
responses. In the late 1990s, the distinct 
identity of the vomeronasal system was 
confirmed at the molecular level with 
the cloning of a family of vomeronasal 
receptors—the VRs—whose genomic 
identity and expression was specific 
for the chemosensory neurons of the 
vomeronasal organ. The VRs are seven- 
transmembrane G-protein-coupled 
receptors (see figure). They fall into two 
major classes, V1Rs and V2Rs, each 
of which uses a different G-protein- 
coupled cascade to activate signaling. 
In addition, the V2Rs are co-expressed 
_ (and thought to interact functionally 
with) members of the major histocom- 
_ patibility (MHC) family of cell surface 
receptors. This is significant because 
many of the ligands produced by indi- 
viduals and thought to be pheromones 
are associated with MHC proteins. 
_ Thus, although vomeronasal receptor 
cells look much like their counter- 
parts in the olfactory epithelium (and 
share expression of some molecules), 
their G-protein-coupled receptors are 
genetically and structurally distinct. 
Moreover, signal transduction is accom- 
plished via a completely different set of 
_ second messengers and cyclic nucleo- 
tide-regulated ion channels: transient 
receptor potential (TRP) channels are 
found in vomeronasal receptor neurons, 
whereas a cyclic nucleotide-regulated 
ion channel is the primary molecular 
mediator of excitability in olfactory 
receptor neurons. 
Genetic manipulation of the expres- 
sion of VRs or downstream signaling 
molecules such as TRP channels, as 
well as electrical recordings from single 
neurons in animals exposed to putative 
pheromones, provides functional evi- 
dence that the vomeronasal system is 
indeed a distinct entity, functioning in 
parallel with the "main" olfactory sys- 
tem. Elimination of the TRP channels 
that mediate vomeronasal signal trans- 
duction (or elimination, replacement, or 
mutation of the receptors themselves) 
leads to changes in sexual or reproduc- 
tive behavior, often in a sex-specific 
manner (that is, males and females are 
differentially compromised). Electrical 
recordings from single neurons in the 
hypothalamus and amygdala in rodents 
show that these cells respond specifi- 
cally to chemical constituents of urine 
or other excreta thought to contain 
pheromones that elicit stereotypic 
reproductive or aggressive behaviors. 
The fate of the vomeronasal sys- 
tem in primates, especially humans, is 
mysterious. The vomeronasal organ is 
absent in most primates, as is a region 
of the olfactory bulb that corresponds 
to the accessory olfactory bulb. There 
are few recognizable VR genes in the

human genome, and those that have 
some homology are pseudogenes— 
they are not expressed and do not 
appear to encode functional proteins. 
Nevertheless, primates, including 
humans, have behavioral responses 
that can be attributed to pheromone 
or pheromone-like stimuli, includ- 
ing the control of menstrual cycle in 
women exposed to either same-sex or 
opposite-sex individuals, and much 
more controversial studies of male- and 
female-specific responses to odorants 
and the reversal of these responses in 
the hypothalamus of individuals of dif-. 
ferent sexual orientations (see Chapter" 
30). Thus, in some mammals, the

vomeronasal system provides a distinct 
chemosensory parallel pathway for 
detecting and processing chemosensory 
signals about reproduction and social 
interactions, but for others, including 
humans, the representation of such 
information—if indeed it is specifically 
represented—remains obscure.

Primates, including humans, do not have vomeronasal 
organs, distinct vomeronasal receptor neurons, or signifi- 
cant numbers of functional vomeronasal receptor genes. 
Despite many attempts to identify pheromones that elicit 
responses from humans, there is little evidence for them. 
Although rudimentary vomeronasal organs are found bi- 
laterally in 8% of adults, there is no clear indication that 
these structures have any significant function. Neverthe- 
less, recent observations suggest that exposure to andro- 
gen- and estrogen-like compounds that may approximate 
potential airborne signals for sexual attraction at concentra- 
tions below the level of conscious detection can elicit dif- 
ferent patterns of brain activation in adult female and male 
human subjects (see Chapter 30). The foci of activation by 
these odors include specific regions of the hypothalamus 
(Figure 15.6) as well as the amygdala—areas believed to 
mediate reproductive, emotional, and social behaviors. 
Thus, olfactory-related structures in the human brain can 
evidently detect signals initially transduced and encoded by 
some class of peripheral chemosensory receptor cells that 
may influence reproductive and other behaviors. 
Olfactory Epithelium and Olfactory 
Receptor Neurons 
The transduction of olfactory information—a series of 
neural events that ultimately results in the conscious sense 
of smell—begins in the olfactory epithelium, the sheet of 
neurons and supporting cells that lines approximately half 
of the surface of the nasal cavity (see Figure 15.1). The re- 
maining intranasal surface is lined by respiratory epithe- 
lium similar to that in the trachea and lungs. Respiratory 
epithelium primarily maintains appropriate temperature 
and moisture for inhaled air (which may be important for

an immune barrier that protects the nasal 
cavity from irritation and infection. 
The neural portion of the olfactory epi- 
thelium includes several cell types. The 
Anterior 
most important of these are the olfactory 
receptor neurons (ORNs). These bipolar 
cells give rise to small-diameter, unmy- 
elinated axons at their basal surface that transmit olfac- 
tory information centrally. At the apical surface, an ORN 
gives rise to a single dendritic process that expands into a 
knoblike protrusion from which several microvilli, called 
olfactory cilia, extend into a thick layer of mucus (Figure 
15.7A). The mucus that lines the nasal cavity protects the 
exposed receptor neurons and supporting cells of the olfac- 
tory epithelium and controls the ionic milieu of the olfactory 
cilia, the primary site of odorant transduction (see below). 
Mucus is produced by secretory specializations called Bow- 
man's glands that are distributed throughout the olfactory 
epithelium. When the mucus layer thickens, as during a 
cold, olfactory acuity decreases significantly. Two other cell 
classes, basal cells and sustentacular (supporting) cells, 
are also present in the olfactory epithelium. This entire ap- 
paratus—mucus layer and epithelium with neural and sup- 
porting cells—is called the nasal mucosa. 
ORNs have direct access to odorant molecules as air is 
inspired through the nose into the lungs. A consequence 
of this direct access, however, is that ORNs are exception- 
ally exposed to airborne pollutants, allergens, microorgan- 
isms, and other potentially harmful substances, subjecting 
these neurons to more or less continual damage. Several 
mechanisms help maintain the integrity of the olfactory 
epithelium in the face of this trauma. The mucus secreted 
by Bowman's glands traps and neutralizes some potentially 
harmful agents. In both the respiratory and olfactory epi- 
thelium (Figure 15.7B), immunoglobulins in mucus provide 
an initial line of defense against harmful antigens. The sus- 
tentacular cells also contain enzymes (cytochrome P450s 
and others) that catabolize organic chemicals and other 
potentially damaging molecules. In addition, macrophages 
found throughout the nasal mucosa isolate and remove 
harmful material—as well as the remains of degenerating 
ORNs—since the ultimate solution to the vulnerability of 
olfactory receptor neurons is to maintain a healthy popula- 
tion by a normal cycle of degeneration and regeneration,

analogous to that in other exposed epithelia (such as the 
intestine and lung). 
In rodents, most if not all olfactory neurons are renewed 
every 6 to 8 weeks. This extended time period (6-8 weeks 
represents a significant portion of a mouse or rat's typical 
1.5- to 2-year life span) suggests that neural regeneration 
is a gradual process. Indeed, even though olfactory receptor 
neurons will be regenerated if large populations of extant 
cells are eliminated at one time, this sort of large-scale re- 
generation does not restore normal function (see Box 15A). 
In such individuals, after a period of complete anosmia, 
odor discrimination and identification as well as olfactory- 
guided behavior is often permanently altered. Olfactory 
receptor neuron regeneration relies on maintaining among 
the basal cells in the olfactory epithelium a population of 
neural stem cells that divide to give rise to new receptor 
neurons (Figure 15.7C; see also Chapter 25). This naturally 
occurring regeneration provides an opportunity to investi- 
gate how neural stem cells can successfully produce new 
neurons and reconstitute synaptic connections and func- 
tion in the mature central nervous system, a topic of broad 
clinical interest. The failure of regeneration or repair in most 
regions of the nervous system continues to be one of the 
most intractable problems faced by health care providers 
and their patients. 
In the mature olfactory system, thany of the molecules 
that influence neuronal differentiation, axon outgrowth, 
and synapse formation throughout the developing nervous 
system (see Chapters 22 and 23) are apparently retained 
or reactivated to perform similar functions for regenerat- 
ing olfactory receptor neurons. Understanding how new 
olfactory receptor neurons differentiate, extend axons to 
the brain, and reestablish appropriate functional synaptic 
connections is obviously relevant to stimulating regenera- 
tion of functional connections elsewhere in the brain after 
injury or disease (see Chapter 25). Indeed, other specialized 
cell classes in the mature olfactory system are adapted to 

facilitate constant regeneration. In adults, glial cells called 
olfactory ensheathing cells surround axons in the olfac- 
tory nerve and bulb. These glial cells, which are derived ini- 
tially from the olfactory epithelium, are believed to support 
the growth of new axons through a mature nervous system. 
In experimental therapies following damage to other re- 
gions of the CNS (e.g., the spinal cord), olfactory glial cells 
have been used to construct cellular "bridges" across sites 
of axonal damage to promote regeneration.

basal cells begin to proliferate; their progeny are additional basal 
cells. Within 21 days, all cells in the regenerated epithelium have 
arisen from basal cells. Regenerated cells include olfactory recep- 
tor neurons (ORN), which are double-labeled (green for OMP 
expression as well as the red indicating the neuron's basal-cell

CHAPTER 15 
Odor Transduction and Odorant 
Receptor Proteins 
Odor transduction in the olfactory epithelium begins with 
odorant binding to specific odorant receptor proteins con- 
centrated on the external surface of olfactory cilia. Prior to 
the identification of odorant receptor proteins, the compart- 
mental sensitivity of the cilia to odors was demonstrated 
in physiological experiments (Figure 15.8). Odorants pre- 
sented to the cilia of an isolated olfactory receptor neuron 
elicit a robust electrical response; those presented to the 
cell body do not. Despite their external appearance, olfac- 
tory cilia do not have the cytoskeletal features of motile cilia 
(.e., the "9 + 2" arrangement of microtubules). Instead, the 
actin-rich olfactory cilia more closely resemble microvilli of 
other epithelia (such as the lung and gut) and thus have 
a greatly expanded cellular surface to which odorants can 
bind. Many molecules that are crucial for olfactory trans- 
duction are either enriched or found exclusively in the cilia, 
including the odorant receptor proteins that bind and trans- 
duce chemosensory information. 
The central role of odorant receptor proteins in the en- 
coding of olfactory information was acknowledged in 2004 
when a Nobel Prize was awarded to Richard Axel and Linda

Buck for their discovery of the odorant receptor gene fam- 
ily. Olfactory receptor molecules are homologous to G-pro- 
tein-linked receptors, a category that includes B-adrenergic 
and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, the light-respon- 
sive rhodopsin, and the cone opsins (see Chapters 6 and 
11). In all invertebrates and vertebrates examined thus far, 
odorant receptor proteins have seven membrane-spanning 
hydrophobic domains, potential odorant binding sites in 
the extracellular domain of the protein, and the ability to 
interact with G-proteins at the carboxyl terminal region of 
their cytoplasmic domain (Figure 15.9A). The amino acid 
sequences for these molecules show substantial variability 
in several of the membrane-spanning regions, as well as in 
the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. The specificity 
of odorant recognition and signal transduction is presum- 
ably the result of this molecular variety of odorant receptor 
proteins in the nasal epithelium; however, the molecular 
mechanism by which individual receptors bind specific 
odorants remains poorly understood. 
The number of odorant receptor genes, though substan- 
tial in all species, varies widely. Nevertheless, in all mam- 
mals, odorant receptors are the largest known single gene 
family, representing 3-5% of the genome. Analysis of the 
human genome has identified approximately 950 appar- 
ent odorant receptor genes (Figure 15.9B); the number is 
similar in other primates, including chimpanzees, who 
have approximately 1100. Analysis of the mouse genome 
indicates about 1500 different odorant receptor genes, and 
in certain dogs, including those noted for their olfactory 
abilities (Box 15C), the number is around 1200. Additional 
sequence analysis of apparent mammalian odorant recep- 
tor genes, however, suggests that many of these genes— 
around 60% in humans and chimps versus 15-20% in mice 
and dogs—are not transcribed due to changes that have 
rendered them pseudogenes.* Thus, the number of func- 
tional odorant receptor proteins encoded by stably tran- 
scribed and translated genes is estimated to be around 400 
in humans and chimps versus about 1200 in mice and 1000 
in dogs. In mammals, the number of expressed odorant re- 
ceptors apparently is correlated with the olfactory capacity 
of different species. Similar analysis of complete genome 
sequences from the worm C. elegans and the fruit fly D. 
melanogaster indicate that the worm has approximately 1000 
odorant receptor genes, but the fruit fly has only about 60. 
The functional significance of these quite disparate num- 
bers is not known. 
Expression in olfactory receptor neurons has been 
confirmed for only a limited subset of the huge number 
of odorant receptor genes. Messenger RNAs for different

BOX 15C The "Dogtor" Is In 
Common wisdom holds that having a 
pet, particularly a dog, is good for your 
health. Most of us assume that the pri- 
mary benefits come from the compan- 
_ ionship, as well as the daily exercise, 
that one's dog provides. However, there 
may be more critical benefits of pet 
ownership that reflect the remarkable 
acuity of the canine olfactory system. 
The family dog may in fact be a reliable 
source of early diagnosis for several 
cancers—albeit a diagnostician that 
likes to chew shoes and has a wet nose. 
In the late 1980s, anecdotal reports 
- emerged that claimed family dogs could 
use smell to identify moles and other 
skin blemishes on their owners that 
turned out to be malignant. In recount- 
ing this seemingly strange capacity of 
several dogs, H. Williams, one of the 
original discoverers, reported "a patient 
whose dog constantly sniffed at a mole 
on her leg. On one occasion, the dog 
even tried to bite the lesion off. ... 
[The] constant attention [of the dog] 
prompted her to seek medical advice. 
The lesion was excised and histology 
showed the lesion to be a malignant 
melanoma." 
Subsequently, similar diagnoses by 
individual pets for their owners were 
reported, including a Labrador who 
detected a basal cell carcinoma that had 
developed from an eczema lesion on his 
master's skin. A slightly less anecdotal 
study relied on techniques used to train 
explosive-sniffing dogs for airport secu- 
rity. In this instance, George, a schnau- 
zer, was trained to distinguish malig- 
nant melanomas in cell culture from 
their non-malignant melanocyte coun- 
terparts. George was then introduced to 
a person who had several moles. One 
mole caused George to "go crazy"; a 
biopsy proved that the mole was indeed 
an early malignant melanoma. 
Over the ensuing years, further 
anecdotal evidence suggested that 
dogs could recognize lung, breast, and 
bladder cancer using olfaction. These

_ reports remained in the category of 
"shagey (or sniffy) dog" stories until 
2006, when a truly systematic analysis 
_ of this apparent diagnostic capacity was 
_ published. In this study, five ordinary 
_ adult dogs were trained to distinguish 
_ exhaled breath samples from lung and 
_ breast cancer patients versus healthy 
_ controls. The dogs were then tested for 
| their ability to distinguish patients from 
_ controls in an entirely novel sample 
- population. In this instance, the speci- 
_ ficity and sensitivity of the dogs' ability 
_ to detect lung cancer from early to late 
stages was 99% as accurate as that of 
_ conventional biopsy diagnosis. The 
- accuracy of breast cancer detection was 
_ 
slightly lower—approximately 90% that 
_ of conventional methods. 
A similar study that challenged dogs 
to discriminate urine from patients with 
_ and without bladder cancer had paral- 
lel but somewhat less robust results. 
_ During the course of this study, how- 
ever, the dogs consistently identified 
a presumed "control" sample as that 
from a cancer patient. Clinicians were 
sufficiently alerted to perform further 
diagnostic tests, and in fact discovered a 
kidney carcinoma in this individual. 
Aside from writing a new chapter 
in the saga of the salutatory relation- 
ship between humans and dogs, these 
observations have several implications 
for understanding the mechanisms 
and biological significance of olfactory 
acuity and selectivity. First, there is evi- 
dence that the concentration of alkanes 
and other volatile organic compounds 
is increased in air exhaled from patients 
with lung cancer. Thus, as indicated 
by preliminary studies of odorant 
receptor molecule sensitivity, 7-trans- 
membrane G-protein-coupled odorant 
receptors may be specialized to detect 
and discriminate a wide—and biologi- 
cally significant—spectrum of volatile 
organic compounds at low concentra- 
tions. Second, the discrimination made 
between patients and controls, either by 
untrained individual dogs or the trained 
group of dogs, suggests that subtle 
distinctions in olfactory perception 
are clearly represented and can guide 
behavior. The apparent heightened 
olfactory ability in dogs may reflect a 
somewhat larger number of odorant 
receptors and/or relatively larger olfac- 
tory periphery that allow increased 
sensitivity, or specialized circuitry in 
the olfactory bulb, pyriform cortex, or 
other brain regions that assign cognitive 
significance to distinct olfactory stimuli. 
Whether this ability has adaptive sig- 
nificance for dogs or is just the ultimate 
smart pet trick is unclear. 
Does this mean the term "pet scan" 
will soon take on a new meaning in 
clinical medicine? Clearly, the complex- 
ity of making critical diagnoses and the 
potential lack of reliability of dogs— 
however well trained—render routine 
use of diagnostic dogs difficult to imag- 
ine. Nevertheless, the remarkable olfac- 
tory capacity of these animals provides 
a starting point for an understanding 
of the molecular specificity of odorant 
receptors, as well as processing capac- 
ity and representations of olfactory 
information in the central nervous sys- 
tem. Such understanding may not only 
illuminate the functional characteristics 
of the olfactory system; it may provide 
a natural guide to specific molecules 
associated with disease states and the 
design of better diagnostic tools—or at 
least diagnoses that don't rely on cold, 
wet noses.

odorant receptor genes are expressed in subsets of ORNs 
that occur in bilaterally symmetric zones of olfactory epithe- 
lium. Additional evidence for restricted patterns of odorant 
receptor gene expression in spatially restricted subsets of 
olfactory receptor neurons comes from molecular genetic 
experiments (primarily in mice and fruit flies) in which re- 
porter proteins such as B-galactosidase or GFP are inserted 
into odorant receptor gene loci (Figure 15.10). Genetic as 
well as cell biological analyses show that most mammalian 
ORNs express only one odorant receptor gene. Thus, differ- 
ent odors activate molecularly and spatially distinct subsets 
of ORNs. Furthermore, because only one of the two copies 
of each odorant receptor gene is expressed in any particular 
receptor neuron, one of the two alleles for each gene must 
be silenced in each ORN. Thus molecular diversity, along 
with the complex genomic regulation of odorant receptors 
and the resulting cellular diversity for olfactory receptor 
neurons, certainly mediate the capacity of olfactory systems 
to detect and encode a wide range of complex and novel 
odors in the environment. 
Physiological Mechanisms of Odor 
Transduction 
Once an odorant is bound to an odor receptor protein, 
several additional steps are required to generate a receptor 
potential that converts chemical information into electri- 
cal signals that can be interpreted by the brain. In mam- 
mals, the principal pathway for generating electrical activ- 
ity in olfactory receptors involves cyclic nucleotide-gated 
ion channels similar to those found in rod photoreceptors 
(see Chapter 11). The olfactory receptor neurons express 
an olfactory-specific heterotrimeric G-protein, G,, whose 
alpha subunit dissociates upon odorant binding to receptor

proteins and then activates adenyl cyclase III (ACIII), an 
olfactory-specific adenylate cyclase (Figure 15.11A). Both 
of these proteins are restricted to the olfactory knob and 
cilia, consistent with the idea that odor transduction occurs 
in these domains of the ORN (see Figure 15.8A). Stimula- 
tion of odorant receptor molecules leads to an increase in 
cyclic AMP (cAMP), which opens cyclic nucleotide-gated 
channels that permit the entry of Na* and Ca** (mostly 
Ca?+), thus depolarizing the neuron. This depolarization, 
amplified by a Ca?*-activated Cl current, is conducted pas- 
sively from the cilia to the axon hillock region of the olfac- 
tory receptor neuron, where action potentials are generated 
via voltage-regulated Na* channels and transmitted to the 
olfactory bulb. 
There are also distinct signaling mechanisms for repolar- 
ization, recovery, and adaptation in response to odorants. 
Most of these mechanisms reflect concurrent increases in 
Ca2* and activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent ki- 
nase II. In response to elevated Ca**, an Na*/Ca** exchanger

extrudes Ca** and transports Na* to re-polarize the mem- 
brane. Recovery relies on calcium/calmodulin kinase II-me- 
diated mechanisms that restore the heterotrimeric G,,, and 
diminish cAMP levels via activation of phosphodiesterases. 
Finally, adaptation relies on cAMP-regulated phosphoryla- 
tion of intracellular domains of the odorant receptor pro- 
teins, as well as engagement of B-arrestin (which serves a 
similar role in photoreceptor adaptation) to modify receptor 
sensitivity. These mechanisms for adaptation likely play a 
large role in perceived changes in sensitivity to smells, such 
as initially noticing, but later not sensing, the smell of ciga- 
rette smoke in a "smoking" hotel room. 
In genetically engineered mice, inactivation of any one of 
the major signal transduction elements (Gye ACII, or the 
cyclic nucleotide-gated channel) results in a loss of receptor 
response to odorants in olfactory receptor neurons—neu- 
rons that otherwise appear normal in these animals (Figure 
15.11B). There is also complete loss of behavioral response 
to most odorants; in other words, these mice are anosmic. 
This common endpoint following loss of function of each 
molecule demonstrates that each signaling step—receptor- 
mediated G-protein activation, adenyl cyclase-mediated el- 
evation of cAMP levels, and Ca?*-mediated activation of the 
cyclic nucleotide-gated channel—contributes to the trans- 
duction of odorants. Nevertheless, in mice, a few ORNs 
may use a different G-protein-mediated transduction path- 
way, perhaps explaining some residual chemosensory func- 
tion following inactivation of G,,, ACIII, or the cyclic nu- 
cleotide-gated channel. These ORNs, however, represent a 
very small portion of the full complement of chemosensory 
neurons. Moreover, in invertebrates (including Drosophila), 
some odorant receptors may act as ion channels, directly 
influencing depolarization (and thus odor transduction) 
without activating G-proteins. Thus, although the overall 
molecular structure of odorant receptor proteins has been 
conserved, these proteins function in diverse ways. 
Like other sensory receptor cells, individual olfactory re- 
ceptor neurons are sensitive to subsets of stimuli—i.e., there 
is receptor specificity. Some olfactory receptor neurons

resulting in the generation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). One target of cAMP is a cation- 
selective channel that, when open, permits the influx of Na* and Ca?* into the cilia, 
resulting in depolarization. The ensuing increase in intracellular Ca** opens Ca?*-gated 
Cl channels that provide most of the depolarization of the olfactory receptor potential. 
The receptor potential is reduced in magnitude when cAMP is broken down by specific 
phosphodiesterases to reduce its concentration. At the same time, Ca?* complexes with 
calmodulin (Ca**-CAM) and binds to the channel, reducing its affinity for CAMP. Finally, 
Ca'* is extruded through the Ca?*/Na* exchange pathway. (B) Consequences of inacti- 
vation of critical molecules in the odorant signal transduction cascade. The images of 
olfactory receptor neurons show expression of G,,, ACIII, and the cyclic nucleotide-gated 
channel. The traces below show odorant-elicited electrical activity in the olfactory epi- 
thelium, measured extracellularly using the electro-olfactogram (EOG). In the wild type, 
a robust response results when either pleasant (citralva) or pungent (isomenthone) 
odors are presented. Inactivating any of the major signal transduction molecules linked 
to the 7-transmembrane odorant receptors abolishes these responses. (A adapted from 
Menini, 1999; B from Belluscio et al., 1998 [GJ]; Wong et al., 2000 [ACIII]; and Brunet 
et al., 1996 [CNG].) 
exhibit marked selectivity to a single chem- 
ically defined odorant, whereas others are 
activated by a number of different odor- 
ant molecules (Figure 15.12). Presumably, 
these differences parallel the expression 
of a single odorant receptor gene in each 
olfactory receptor neuron. Thus, some re- 
ceptor proteins must have fairly high af- 
finity for some odorants, while others are 
less selective. Currently, no chemical or 
physiological data indicate a correspon- 
dence between high-affinity binding of 
an odorant to an odor receptor molecule, 
electrical activation of the olfactory recep- 
tor neuron, and perception of a specific 
odor in mammals. Indeed, most randomly 
selected single ORNs have broadly tuned 
responses to a variety of odorants (Figure 
15.13A). Nevertheless, genetic labeling 
studies have demonstrated that consis- 
tent relationships exist between classes 
of odorants and the responses they elicit 
in individual cells isolated from olfactory 
epithelium. Response specificity reflects 
chemical differences in subsets of odorant 
mixtures (defined by differences in carbon 
chain length of the molecular "backbone" 
of an odorant). These responses can be 
fairly broad (for example, a single ORN 
responds relatively well to three differ- 
ent mixtures; see Figure 15.13A). If, how- 
ever, an ORN that expresses an odorant 
receptor protein that binds an identified 
ligand is isolated (for example, the M71 
odorant receptor, which is known to bind 
acetophenone and benzaldehyde; Figure 
15.13B), it responds specifically to the mix- 
ture that includes those odorants. It is not 
known, however, whether any of these 
odorant molecules represent the "best" 
(i.e., highest affinity) or most environ- 
mentally relevant odorants for any given 
receptor protein. 
The Olfactory Bulb 
The transduction of odorants in the olfac- 
tory cilia and the subsequent changes in 
electrical activity in the olfactory receptor 
neuron are only the first steps in olfactory 
information processing. Unlike other pri- 
mary sensory receptor cells (e.g., photo- 
receptors in the retina or hair cells in the 
cochlea), olfactory receptor neurons have

tials. As the axons leave the olfactory epithe- 
lium, they coalesce to form a large number 
of 
bundles that together make up the olfactory 
nerve (cranial nerve I). Each olfactory nerve 
projects ipsilaterally to the olfactory bulb, 
which in humans lies on the ventral anterior 
aspect of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. 
The most distinctive feature of the olfactory 
bulb is the array of glomeruli—more or less 
spherical accumulations of neuropil 100-200 
um in diameter. Glomeruli lie just beneath 
the surface of the bulb and are the synaptic 
target of the primary olfactory axons (Figure 15.14). In 
vertebrates, ORN axons make excitatory glutamatergic 
synapses within the glomeruli. Remarkably, this rela- 
tionship between the olfactory periphery (the nose, or 
insect antennae—that is, the structures where olfactory 
receptor neurons are found) and glomeruli in the central 
nervous system is maintained across the animal king- 
dom (Figure 15.14A, inset). 
In mammals, including humans, within each glom- 
erulus the axons of the receptor neurons contact apical 
dendrites of mitral cells, which are the principal projec- 
tion neurons of the olfactory bulb. The cell bodies of the 
mitral cells are located in a distinct layer of the olfactory 
bulb deep within the glomeruli. A mitral cell extends

the apical dendrites of approximately 25 mitral cells, which 
in turn receive input from approximately 25,000 olfactory 
receptor axons. Remarkably, most if not all 25,000 of these 
axons come from olfactory receptor neurons that express 
the same, single odorant receptor gene (Figure 15.14E). This

Organization of the mammalian olfac- 
tory bulb. (A) When the bulb is viewed from its dorsal surface 
(visualized here in a living mouse in which the overlying bone 
has been removed), olfactory glomeruli can be seen. The dense 
accumulation of dendrites and synapses that constitute glomer- 
uli are stained here with a vital fluorescent dye that recognizes 
neuronal processes. The inset shows a similar arrangement of 
glomeruli in the mushroom body (the equivalent of the olfac- 
tory bulb) in Drosophila. (B) Among the major neuronal com- 
ponents of each glomerulus are the apical tufts of mitral cells, 
which project to the pyriform cortex and other bulb targets 
(see Figure 15.1C). In this image of a coronal section through 
the bulb, they have been labeled retrogradely by placing the 
lipophilic tracer Di-| in the lateral olfactory tract. (C) The cellular 
structure of the olfactory bulb, shown in a Nissl-stained coronal 
section. The five layers of the bulb are indicated. The glomeru- 
lar layer includes the tufts of mitral cells, the axon terminals of 
olfactory receptor neurons, and periglomerular cells that define 
the margins of each glomerulus. The external plexiform layer 
is made up of lateral dendrites of mitral cells, cell bodies and 
lateral dendrites of tufted cells, and dendrites of granule cells 
degree of convergence presumably increases the sensitivity 
of mitral cells to ensure maximal fidelity of odor detection. It 
may also maximize the signal strength from the convergent 
olfactory receptor neuron input by averaging out uncorre- 
lated "background" noise. Each glomerulus also includes 
dendritic processes from two other classes of local circuit 
neurons: approximately 50 tufted cells and 25 periglomerular 
cells contribute to each glomerulus (see Figure 15.14D). Al- 
though it is generally assumed that these neurons sharpen 
the sensitivity of individual glomeruli to specific odorants, 
their function is unclear. 
Finally, granule cells, which constitute the innermost 
layer of the vertebrate olfactory bulb, synapse primarily 
on the basal dendrites of mitral cells within the external 
plexiform layer (see Figure 15.14C,D). Granule cells lack an 
identifiable axon, and instead make reciprocal dendroden- 
dritic synapses with mitral cells. Granule cells are thought 
to establish local lateral inhibitory circuits with mitral cells 
as well as participating in synaptic plasticity in the olfactory 
bulb. Olfactory granule cells and periglomerular cells are 
among the few classes of neurons in the forebrain that can 
be replaced throughout life in some mammals (see Chapter 
25). In humans, however, the available evidence suggests 
that these cells are not lost and regenerated in adulthood. 
The relationship between olfactory receptor neurons ex- 
pressing one odorant receptor and small subsets of glom- 
eruli (see Figure 15.14E) suggests that individual glomeruli 
respond specifically (or at least selectively) to distinct odor- 
ants. The selective (but not singular) responses of subsets 
of glomeruli to particular odorants has been confirmed 
physiologically in invertebrates such as Drosophila, as well 
as in mice, using single and multiunit recordings, metabolic

that make dendrodendritic synapses with the other dendritic 
elements. The mitral cell layer is defined by the cell bodies of 
mitral cells, and mitral cell axons are found in the internal plexi- 
form layer. Finally, granule cell bodies are densely packed into 
the granule cell layer. (D) Laminar and circuit organization of 
the olfactory bulb, shown diagrammatically in a cutaway view 
from its medial surface. Olfactory receptor cell axons synapse 
with mitral cell apical dendritic tufts and periglomerular cell 
processes within glomeruli. Granule cells and mitral cell lateral 
dendrites constitute the major synaptic elements of the exter- 
nal plexiform layer. (E) Axons from olfactory receptor neurons 
that express a particular odorant receptor gene converge ona 
small subset of bilaterally symmetrical glomeruli. These glom- 
eruli, indicated in the boxed area in the upper panel, are shown 
at higher magnification in the lower panel. The projections 
from the olfactory epithelium have been labeled by a reporter 
transgene inserted by homologous recombination ("knocked 
in") into the genetic locus that encodes the particular receptor.

mapping, voltage-sensitive dyes, genetically encoded sen- 
sors of electrical activity, or intrinsic signals that depend on 
blood oxygenation. Such studies show that increasing the 
odorant concentration increases the activity of individual 
glomeruli, as well as the number of glomeruli activated. In 
addition, different single odorants, or odorants with distinct 
chemical structures (for example, length of the carbon chain 
in the backbone of the odorant molecule) maximally acti- 
vate one or a few glomeruli (Figure 15.15A). 
It is still not clear how (or whether) odor identity and 
concentration is mapped across the entire array, or reflects 
the activation of smaller subsets of glomeruli. Given the 
response of small numbers of glomeruli to single odorants, 
one might expect that complex natural odors such as those 
of coffee, fruits, cheeses, or spices—each of which is com- 
posed of more than a hundred compounds—would activate 
a very large number of olfactory glomeruli. Surprisingly, this 
is not the case. In mice, natural odorants presented at their 
normal concentrations activate a relatively small number of 
glomeruli (up to 20), each of which responds selectively to 
one or two molecules that characterize the complex odor 
(Figure 15.15B). Thus, to solve the problem of representing 
complex odorants, the olfactory system appears to employ 
a sparse coding mechanism that cues in on a small number 
of dominant chemicals within a mixture (see Figure 15.13) 
and represents that mixture over a relatively small sub- 
set of glomeruli. One useful metaphor is to envision the 
sheet of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb as an array of lights 
on a movie marquee; the spatial distribution of the active 
and inactive glomeruli ("lit and unlit lights") produces a 
message that is unique for a given odorant at a particular 
concentration.

Cortical Processing of Information 
Relayed from the Olfactory Bulb 
Mitral cell axons provide the only relay for olfactory infor- 
mation to the rest of the brain. The mitral cell axons from 
each olfactory bulb form a bundle—the lateral olfactory 
tract—that projects to the accessory olfactory nuclei, the ol- 
factory tubercle, the pyriform and entorhinal cortex, as well 
as to portions of the amygdala (see Figure 15.1). Most pro- 
jections of the lateral olfactory tract are ipsilateral; however, 
a subset of mitral cell axons cross the midline, presumably 
initiating bilateral processing of some aspects of olfactory 
information. The major target of the lateral olfactory tract 
is the three-layered pyriform cortex in the ventromedial 
aspect of the human temporal lobe, near the optic chiasm. 
Neurons in pyriform cortex respond to odors, and mitral cell 
inputs from glomeruli that receive odorant receptor-specific 
projections are distributed across the pyriform cortex. 
Recent work suggests that the segregation of responses 
to single odors in the pyriform cortex is far less focal than 
that in the olfactory bulb. In fact, individual pyriform cortical 
cells seem to be more broadly tuned to different odors than 
is the case in the olfactory bulb, and the neurons that re- 
spond to single odors are distributed throughout extended

regions of the pyriform cortex (Figure 15.16). Apparently, 
the segregation of information in the olfactory bulb is not 
maintained in the pyriform cortex; however, there may be 
some segregation of glomerular inputs to the amygdala. 
Thus, the nature of the transformation of information from 
the olfactory epithelium through the bulb to the pyriform 
cortex remains somewhat difficult to discern. 
The pyriform cortex has pyramidal neurons that project 
to a variety of forebrain targets. Thus, olfactory informa- 
tion is distributed broadly to forebrain regions, where it can 
influence a full range of behaviors. Significant numbers of 
neurons in the pyriform cortex innervate directly a variety of 
areas in the neocortex, including the orbitofrontal cortex in 
humans and other primates, where multimodal responses 
to complex stimuli—particularly food—include an olfactory 
component. Pyriform cortical neurons also project to the 
thalamus, hippocampus, hypothalamic nuclei, and amyg- 
dala. The connections between the pyriform cortex and the 
mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, which is implicated in 
human memoty (see Chapter 31), are thought to influence 
olfactory-guided memory via mediodorsal connections with 
the frontal cortex. Projections to the hippocampus are simi- 
larly thought to play a role in olfactory-guided memory, but 
there is very little indication of how olfaction and mnemonic 
information are integrated. Finally, connections between the 
pyriform cortex, hypothalamus, and amygdala are thought to 
influence visceral, appetitive, and sexual behaviors. 
The details of central olfactory processing are unclear, in 
large measure because of the difficulty of studying the pro- 
cessing of specific olfactory stimuli. Nevertheless, these path- 
ways insure that information about odors reaches a variety of 
forebrain regions, allowing olfactory perception to influence 
cognitive, visceral, emotional, and homeostatic behaviors.

The Organization of the Taste System 
The second chemosensory system, the taste system, repre- 
sents the chemical as well as physical qualities of ingested 
substances, primarily food. In concert with the olfactory and 
trigeminal systems, taste reflects the aesthetic and nutritive 
qualities of food as well as indicating whether or not a food 
item is safe to be ingested. Once in the mouth, the chemical 
constituents of food interact with receptor proteins on taste 
cells, which are located in epithelial specializations called 
taste buds in the tongue. Taste cells transduce chemical 
stimuli to encode information about the identity, concen- 
tration, and qualities (pleasant, unpleasant, or potentially

harmful) of the substance. This information also 
prepares the gastrointestinal system to receive and 
digest food by causing salivation and swallowing— 
or, if the substance is noxious, gagging and regurgi- 
tation. Information about the temperature and tex- 
ture of food (including viscosity and fat content) is 
transduced and relayed from the tongue and mouth 
via somatic sensory receptors from the trigeminal 
and other sensory cranial nerves to the thalamus 
and somatic sensory cortices (see Chapters 9 and 
10). Of course, food is not simply eaten for nutri- 
tional value or avoided because of unpleasant or 
potentially harmful qualities; "taste" also depends 
on cultural and psychological factors. How else can 
one explain why so many people enjoy consuming 
hot peppers or bitter-tasting liquids such as beer? 
Like the olfactory system, the taste system is de- 
fined by its specialized peripheral receptors as well 
as by a number of central pathways that relay and 
process taste information (Figure 15.17). Taste cells 
(the peripheral receptors) are found in taste buds 
distributed on the dorsal surface of the tongue, soft 
palate, pharynx, and the upper part of the esopha- 
gus. Taste cells synapse with primary sensory axons 
that run in the chorda tympani and greater superior 
petrosal branches of the facial nerve (cranial nerve 
VII), the lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal 
nerve (cranial nerve IX), and the superior laryngeal 
branch of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) to in- 
nervate the taste buds in the tongue, palate, epiglottis, and 
esophagus, respectively. The central axons of these primary 
sensory neurons in the respective cranial nerve ganglia 
project to rostral and lateral regions of the nucleus of the 
solitary tract in the medulla (see Figure 15.17A), which is 
also known as the gustatory nucleus of the solitary tract 
complex. (The posterior region of the solitary tract nucleus 
is the main target of afferent visceral sensory information 
related to the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of 
the visceral motor system; see Chapter 21.) 
The distribution of the cranial nerves that innervate taste 
buds in the oral cavity is topographically represented along

the rostral—caudal axis of the rostral portion of the gustatory 
nucleus; the terminations from the facial nerve are rostral, 
the glossopharyngeal are in the midregion, and those from 
the vagus nerve are more caudal in the nucleus (see Fig- 
ure 15.17A). Integration of taste and visceral sensory infor- 
mation is presumably facilitated by this arrangement. The 
caudal part of the nucleus of the solitary tract also receives 
innervation from subdiaphragmatic branches of the vaeus 
nerve, which control gastric motility. Interneurons connect- 
ing the rostral and caudal regions of the nucleus represent 
the first interaction between visceral and gustatory stimuli, 
and these connections can be thought of as the sensory limb 
of a gustatory—visceral reflex arc. This close relationship be- 
tween gustatory and visceral information makes sense, since 
an animal must quickly recognize if it is eating something 
that is likely to make it sick and respond accordingly. 

Axons from the rostral (gustatory) part of the solitary nu- 
cleus project to the ventral posterior complex of the thala- 
mus, where they terminate in the medial half of the ventral 
posterior medial nucleus. This nucleus projects in turn 
to several regions of the neocortex, including the anterior 
insula in the temporal lobe (the insular taste cortex) and 
the operculum of the frontal lobe (see Figure 15.17B). There 
is also a secondary neocortical taste area in the caudolateral 
orbitofrontal cortex; here neurons respond to combinations 
of visual, somatic sensory, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli. 
Interestingly, when a given food is consumed to the point 
of satiety, specific orbitofrontal neurons in the monkey di- 
minish their activity to that tastant, suggesting that these 
neurons are involved in the conscious motivation to eat (or 
not to eat) particular foods. Finally, reciprocal projections 
connect the nucleus of the solitary tract via nuclei in the 
pons to the hypothalamus and amygdala. These projections 
presumably influence affective aspects (e.g., pleasurable 
versus aversive experience of food; food-seeking behavior) 
of appetite, satiety, and other homeostatic responses asso- 
ciated with eating (recall that the hypothalamus is the major 
center governing homeostasis; see Chapter 21).

Taste Perception in Humans 
The taste system encodes information about the quantity as 
well as the identity of stimuli. Most taste stimuli are non- 
volatile, hydrophilic molecules that are soluble in saliva. 
In general, the perceived intensity of taste is directly pro- 
portional to the concentration of the taste stimulus. In hu- 
mans, threshold concentrations for most ingested tastants 
are quite high. For example, the threshold concentration 
for citric acid is about 2 mM; for salt (NaCl) 10 mM; and 
for sucrose 20 mM. (In contrast, recall that the perceptual 
threshold for some odorants is as low as 0.01 nM.) Because 
the body requires substantial concentrations of salt and car- 
bohydrates, taste cells may respond only to relatively high 
concentrations of these essential substances in order to 
promote an adequate intake. Clearly, it is advantageous for 
the taste system to detect potentially dangerous substances 
(e.g., bitter-tasting plant compounds, which may be nox- 
ious or poisonous) at much lower concentrations. Thus the 
threshold concentration for such tastants is relatively low: 
that for quinine is 0.008 mM, and for the deadly substance 
strychnine it is 0.0001 mM. 
Tastants are detected over the full surface the tongue 
in receptive specializations called taste papillae (Figure 
15.18A). Papillae are defined by multicellular protuberances 
surrounded by local invaginations in the tongue epithelium.

graph of a taste bud, showing various types of

The taste cells make synapses on the gustatory 
afferent axons. The apical surface of the recep- 
tor cells have microvilli that are oriented toward 
the taste pore. (Micrograph from Ross et al., 
1995.)

CHAPTER 15 
These invaginations form a trench to concentrate solubi- 
lized tastants. Taste buds are distributed along the lateral 
surfaces of the papillar protuberance as well as in the trench 
walls. They consist of specialized neuroepithelial receptor 
cells called taste cells, some supporting cells, and occasional 
basal cells (Figure 15.18B). In humans, approximately 4000 
taste buds are distributed throughout the surface of the 
tongue as well as the palate, epiglottis, and esophagus. 
Taste cells are clustered around a 1 mm opening called a 
taste pore in the taste bud near the surface of the tongue 
(see Figure 15.18B). Solubilized tastants are further concen- 
trated and are presented directly to the exposed taste recep- 
tor cells in the relatively small region of the taste pore. Like 
olfactory receptor neurons (and presumably for the same 
reasons—exposure to infectious agents and environmental 
toxins), taste cells have a lifetime of about 2 weeks. Taste 
cells are apparently regenerated from basal cells, which 
constitute a local stem cell population that is retained in 
the mature tongue. 
There are three types of papillae: fungiform (which con- 
tain about 25% of the total number of taste buds), circum- 
vallate (50%), and foliate (the remaining 25%). The three 
classes are distributed discontinuously on the surface of the 
tongue. Fungiform papillae are found only on the anterior 
two-thirds of the tongue; the highest density (about 30 per 
cm') is at the tip. Fungiform papillae have a mushroom-like 
structure (hence their name) and typically have about three 
taste buds at their apical surface. Nine circumvallate papil- 
lae form a chevron at the rear of the tongue. Each consists 
of a circular trench containing about 250 taste buds along 
the trench walls (see Figure 15.18A). Two foliate papil- 
lae are present on the posterolateral tongue, each having 
about 20 parallel ridges with about 600 taste buds in their 
walls. Thus, chemical stimuli on the tongue first stimulate 
receptors in the fungiform papillae and then in the foliate 
and circumvallate papillae. Tastants subsequently stimu- 
late scattered taste buds in the pharynx, larynx, and upper 
esophagus. 
Based on general agreement across cultures, the taste 
system detects five perceptually distinct categories of tas- 
tants: salt, sour, sweet, bitter, and umami. (From the 
Japanese word for delicious, umami refers to savory tastes, 
including monosodium glutamate and other amino acids 
that provide the flavor in cooked meat and other protein- 
tich foods.) These five perceptual categories have dietary 
and metabolic significance: salt tastes include NaCl, which 
is needed for electrolyte balance; essential amino acids such 
as glutamate are needed for protein synthesis; sugars such 
as glucose and other carbohydrates are needed for energy; 
sour tastes, associated with acidity and thus protons (H*), 
indicate the palatability of various foods (for example, the 
citric acid in oranges); bitter-tasting molecules, including 
plant alkaloids such as atropine, quinine, and strychnine, 
indicate foods that may be poisonous. 
There are obvious limitations to this classification. Peo- 
ple experience a variety of gustatory or ingestive sensations 
in addition to these five, including astringent (cranberries 
and tea), pungent (hot peppers and ginger), fat, starch, and 
various metallic tastes, to name only a few. In addition, 
mixtures of chemicals may elicit entirely new taste sensa- 
tions. Finally, at low concentrations the protective response 
to aversive tastes can be overridden, leading to acquired 
tastes for foods having sour or bitter flavor, such as lemons 
(sour) and quinine (bitter). 
Although all tastes can be detected over the entire sur- 
face of the tongue, different regions of the tongue have 
different thresholds for various tastes (Figure 15.19A). 
These discontinuities in taste sensitivity may be related 
to the aesthetic, metabolic, and potentially toxic qualities 
detected by the taste receptors in the tongue. The tip of 
the tongue is most responsive to sweet, umami, and salty 
compounds, all of which produce pleasurable sensations 
at somewhat higher concentrations. Thus, tastes encoun- 
tered by this region—the initial point of contact for most 
ingested foods—activate feeding behaviors such as mouth 
movements, salivary secretion, insulin release, and swal- 
lowing. The acquisition of foods high in carbohydrates and 
amino acids is beneficial (in moderation), and thus it is not 
surprising that the most exposed region of the tongue is 
especially sensitive to these tastes. 
Sour and bitter taste sensitivity is lowest toward the tip 
and greatest on the sides and back of the tongue. It seems 
reasonable that, once it has analyzed for nutrient content,

the receptor surface might next evaluate aesthetic charac- 
teristics like acidity and bitterness that indicate lack of pal- 
atability (excessive sourness) or even toxicity (bitterness). 
Sour-tasting compounds elicit grimaces, puckering, and 
massive salivary secretion to dilute the tastant. Activation 
of the rear of the tongue by bitter-tasting substances elicits 
protrusion of the tongue and other protective reactions (ex- 
pectoration and gagging) that prevent ingestion. 
Each of the primary tastes represented over the surface 
of the tongue corresponds to a distinct class of receptor 
molecules expressed in subsets of taste cells (see the next 
section). Thus,-representation in taste buds of the five pri- 
mary categories of taste perception is closely linked to the 
molecular biology of taste transduction. These taste catego- 
ries are also maintained in the representation of taste infor- 
mation in the central nervous system, including that in the

insular taste cortex (Figure 15.19B). Mapping of responses 
to sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami in normal human 
subjects shows that each of these tastes elicits focal activity 
in the taste cortex, suggesting that information about each 
taste category remains somewhat segregated throughout 
the taste system. 
As in olfaction, gustatory sensitivity declines with age. 
An obvious index of this decline is the tendency of adults 
to add more salt and spices to food than children do. The 
decreased sensitivity to salt can be problematic for older 
people with hypertension as well as electrolyte and/or fluid 
balance problems. Unfortunately, a safe and effective sub- 
stitute for table salt (NaCl) has not yet been developed. 
Taste Receptor Proteins and 
Transduction 
Within the taste buds, only the taste cells are special- 
ized for sensory transduction, and their basic structure 
and function are uniform across all classes of papillae 
Apical 
and their constituent taste buds. There may be some di- 
domain 
versity among taste cells based on expression of recep- 
tor proteins and other molecular determinants, but the 
full significance of these differences remains uncertain. 
Taste cells have distinct apical and basal domains, re- 
flecting their epithelial character (Figure 15.20). Chemo- 
sensory transduction is initiated in the apical domain of 
the taste cells, and electrical signals are generated at the 
basal domain via graded receptor potentials (and cor- 
responding secretion of neurotransmitters). The specific 
neurotransmitters released by taste cells are thought to 
include serotonin, ATP, and GABA. Taste receptor pro- 
teins and related signaling molecules, like those in ol- 
factory receptor neurons, are concentrated on microvilli 
that emerge from the taste cell apical surface. The basal 
FIGURE 15.20 
Sensory transduction in taste cells. Taste cells 
are polarized epithelial cells with an apical and a basal domain 
separated by tight junctions. Tastant-transducing channels (salt 
and sour) and G-protein-coupled receptors (sweet, amino acid, and 
bitter) are limited to the apical domain. Intracellular signaling com- 
ponents that are coupled to taste receptor molecules (G-proteins 
and various second messenger-related molecules) are also enriched 
in the apical domain. Voltage-regulated Na*, K*, and Ca** channels 
mediate release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic specializa- 
tions at the base of the cell onto terminals of peripheral sensory 
afferents. These channels are limited to the basolateral domain, as 
is endoplasmic reticulum that also modulates intracellular Ca** con- 
centration and contributes to the release of neurotransmitter. The 
neurotransmitter serotonin, among others, is found in taste cells, 
and serotonin receptors are found on the sensory afferents. Finally, 
the TRPM, channel, which facilitates G-protein-coupled receptor- 
mediated depolarization, is expressed in taste cells. Its localization 
to apical versus basal domains is not yet known.

CHAPTER 15 
domain is specialized for synaptic activation in response to 
tastant binding on apical receptor proteins. There are volt- 
age-reeulated ion channels as well as channels controlled by 
second messengers—especially members of the transient 
receptor potential, or TRP family. In addition, local endo- 
plasmic reticulum acts as a store that provides Ca** to facili- 
tate synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release at 
synapses made onto gustatory afferents at the basal surface. 
These synapses are made onto primary afferent axons from 
branches of three cranial nerves: the facial (VII), glossopha- 
ryngeal (IX), and vagus (X) nerves (see Figure 15.17A,B). 
Five distinct classes of taste receptor molecules represent 
tastants in five major perceptual categories—salty, sour, 
sweet, bitter, and umami. These receptor molecules are 
thought to be concentrated primarily in the apical micro- 
villi of taste cells. Salty and sour tastes are elicited by ionic 
stimuli such as the positively charged ions in salts (e.g., Na*

from NaCl), or the H* in acids (e.g., acetic acid, which gives 
vinegar its sour taste). Thus, the ions in salty and sour tas- 
tants initiate sensory transduction via specific ion channels, 
most likely an amiloride-sensitive Na* channel for salty tastes 
(Figure 15.21A) and, for sour, an H*-permeant, nonselective 
cation channel that is a member of the TRP family (Figure 
15.21B). The sour receptor channel is related to a similar 
channel protein that is mutated in polycystic kidney disease; 
thus, the channel is referred to as PKD. 
The sour receptor is expressed in a distinct subset of taste 
cells, similar to the segregated expression of receptor proteins 
for sweet, umami, and bitter. The receptor potentials gener- 
ated by the positive inward current carried either by Na* for 
salty or H* for sour directly depolarize the relevant taste cell. 
The initial depolarization leads to the activation of voltage- 
gated Na* channels in the basolateral aspect of the taste cell. 
This additional depolarization activates voltage-gated Ca** 
channels, leading to the release of neurotransmitter from the 
basal aspect of the taste cell and the activation of action po- 
tentials in ganglion cell axons (see Figure 15.20). 
In humans and other mammals, sweet and umami re- 
ceptors are heterodimeric G-protein-coupled receptors that 
FIGURE 15.21

selectivity of the amiloride-sensitive Na* chan- 
nel versus the H*-sensitive proton channel

(B) Sour tastants are transduced by a proton-

larization of the cell. (C-E) For sweet, amino

acid (umami), and bitter tastants, different 
classes of G-protein-coupled receptors mediate 
transduction. (C) For sweet tastants, hetero-

tors transduce stimuli via a PLC, .-mediated,

tion of the TRPM, Ca?* channel. (D) For amino 
acids, heteromeric complexes of T1R1 and 
T1R3 receptors transduce stimuli via the same 
PLC,./IP,/TRPM,-dependent mechanism. (E) 
Bitter tastes are transduced via a distinct set of 
G-protein-coupled receptors, the T2R receptor 
subtypes. The details of T2R receptors are less 
well established; however, they apparently 
associate with the taste cell-specific G-protein 
gustducin, which is not found in sweet or 
amino acid receptor-expressing taste cells. 
Nevertheless, stimulus-coupled depolarization 
for bitter tastes relies on the same PLC, /IP./ 
TRPM,-dependent mechanism used for: sweet 
and amino acid taste transduction. 

share a common 7-transmembrane receptor subunit called 
T1R3, paired with the T1R2 7-transmembrane receptor for 
perception of sweet, or with the T1R1 receptor for amino 
acids (Figure 15.21C,D). The T1R2 and T1R1 receptors are 
expressed in different subsets of taste cells, indicating the 
presence of, respectively, sweet- and amino acid-selective 
cells in the taste buds. Upon binding sugars or other sweet 
stimuli, the T1R2/T1R3 receptor heterodimer initiates a G- 
protein-mediated signal transduction cascade that leads to 
the activation of the phospholipase C isoform PLC,,, lead- 
ing in turn to increased concentrations of inositol triphos- 
phate (IP,) and to the opening of TRP channels (specifically 
the TRPM, channel), which depolarizes the taste cell via in- 
creased intracellular Ca**. Similarly, the TIR1/T1R3 receptor 
is broadly tuned to the 20 standard L-amino acids found in 
proteins (but not to their p-amino acid enantiomers). Trans- 
duction of amino acid stimuli via the T1R1/T1R3 receptor 
also reflects G-protein-coupled intracellular signaling lead- 
ing to PLC,,-mediated activation of the TRPM, channel and 
depolarization of the taste cell (see Figure 15.21D). 
Another family of G-protein-coupled receptors known 
as T2R receptors transduces bitter tastes. Approximately 30 
genes in humans and other mammals encode 30 T2R sub- 
types, and single taste cells express multiple T2R subtypes. 
Indeed, in humans, a well-known mutation for the percep- 
tion of a specific bitter tastant—phenothylcarbamide (PTC) — 
was originally discovered in the early 1930s and identified as 
a simple Mendelian trait shortly thereafter; this has proven 
to be a mutation of a human T2R gene. The observation of a 
selective single gene mutation for bitter taste indicates that 
this taste category is distinct and encoded specifically in taste 
receptor cells. The distribution of T2R receptors among taste 
cells supports this view. T2Rs are not expressed in the same 
taste cells as T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 receptors. Thus, the re- 
ceptor cells for bitter tastants are presumably completely dis- 
tinct from those for sweet and umami, which share at least 
one heterodimeric G-protein-coupled receptor subunit. 
Although the transduction of bitter stimuli relies on a 
mechanism similar to that for sweet and amino acid tastes, 
the taste cell-specific G-protein gustducin, found primar- 
ily in T2R-expressing taste cells, apparently contributes to 
the transduction of bitter tastes (Figure 15.21E). The role of 
eustducin versus that of the other G-proteins for transduc- 
tion of sweet and umami/amino acid tastes remains un- 
clear. The remaining steps in bitter transduction are similar 
to those for sweet and amino acids: PLC,,-mediated activa- 
tion of TRPM, channels depolarizes the taste cell, resulting 
in the release of neurotransmitter at the synapse between 
the taste cell and sensory ganglion cell axon. 
Neural Coding in the Taste System 
In the taste system, neural coding refers to the way that 
the identity, concentration, and "hedonic" (pleasurable or 
THE CHEMICAL SENSES 
347 
aversive) value of tastants is represented in the pattern of 
action potentials relayed to the brain from the taste buds. 
Neurons in the taste system might be specifically "tuned" 
to respond with a maximal change in electrical activity to a 
single taste stimulus. Such tuning might rely on specificity at 
the level of the receptor cells, as well as on the maintenance 
of separate channels for the relay of this information from 
the periphery to the brain. This sort of coding scheme might 
result in distinct responses to discrete peripheral stimuli (e.g,, 
sweet, bitter) in specific cells at multiple points in the path- 
way. The segregated expression of sour, sweet, amino acid, 
and bitter receptors in different taste cells (Figure 15.22A—C) 
and the maintenance of focal activation for each class of taste 
in the insular taste cortex (see Figure 15.17C) is consistent 
with segregation of information from the peripheral recep- 
tors as it is relayed to the CNS for further processing. 
Molecular genetic experiments in mice indicate that 
some perceptual taste categories are established based on 
the identity of T1Rs and T2Rs that are expressed in indi- 
vidual taste cells. Initial support came from studies in which 
the genes that specify the sweet and amino acid hetero- 
meric receptors (T1R2 and T1R1) were inactivated in mice. 
Such mice lack behavioral responses to a broad range of 
sweet or amino acid stimuli, depending on the gene that 
has been inactivated. Moreover, recordings of electrical ac- 
tivity in the relevant branches of cranial nerves VII, IX, or X 
showed that action potentials in response to sweet or amino 
acid stimuli were lost in parallel with the genetic mutation 
and behavioral change. Finally, these deficits in transduc- 
tion and perception were unchanged at a broad range of 
concentrations, indicating that the molecular specificity of 
each receptor is quite rigid—the remaining receptors could 
not respond, even at high concentrations of sweet or amino 
acid stimuli (Figure 15.22D-H). 
These observations suggest that sweet and amino acid 
transduction, representation and processing remain seg- 
regated from the time of encoding at peripheral receptors 
through central processing. Bitter taste are harder to ana- 
lyze because of the larger number of T2R bitter receptors. 
To circumvent this challenge, Charles Zuker, Nicholas 
Ryba, and colleagues took advantage of the shared aspects 
of intracellular signaling for sweet, amino acid, and bitter 
tastes. If the genes for either the TRPM, channel or PLC,, 
are inactivated, behavioral and physiological responses to 
sweet, amino acid, and bitter stimuli are abolished (see Fig- 
ure 15.22), while salty and sour perceptions—which do not 
rely on the G-protein-coupled, PLC,,-mediated transduc- 
tion mechanism—remain. To evaluate whether taste cells 
expressing the T2R family of receptors provide a segregated 
pathway for bitter tastes, PLC,, was selectively re-expressed 
in T2R-expressing taste cells in a PLC,, mutant mouse. Thus, 
in these mice, only the taste cells that normally express the 
T2R subset of receptor genes could tranduce taste signals. 
If these receptors specifically and uniquely encode bitter

(A-C) Sweet, amino acid, and bitter receptors are expressed in 
different subsets of taste cells. (D-E) The gene for the TRPM, 
channel can be inactivated in mice (TRPM,"-) and behavioral 
responses measured with a taste preference test. The mouse 
is presented with two drinking spouts, one with water and the 
other with a tastant; responses are measured as the frequency 
of licking of the two spouts. For pleasant tastes such as sweet 
(sucrose; D) or umami (glutamate; E), control mice lick the spout 
with the tastant more frequently; higher concentrations of tas- 
tant leads to increased response (black lines). In TRPM,-" mice, 
this preference for the tastant versus water is eliminated at all 
concentrations (red lines). (F) For an aversive tastant like bitter 
quinine, control mice prefer water. This behavioral resoonse— 
which is initially low—is further diminished with higher quinine 
concentrations (black line). Inactivation of TRPM, also eliminates 
this behavioral response, regardless of tastant concentration 
(red line). (G-I) When the PLC,, gene is knocked out, behav- 
ioral response to (G) sucrose, (H) glutamate, and (I) quinine are 
eliminated (red lines). When PLC,, is re-expressed only in T2R- 
expressing taste cells, behavioral responses to sucrose and glu-

the behavioral response to quinine is restored to normal levels

tastes, the "rescued" mice (i.e., those expressing PLC,, 
in 
2 
: 
Be 
T2R cells) should regain their perceptual and physiologi- 
cal responses to bitter, but not sweet or amino acid, tastes. 
This was indeed the result of the experiment: behavioral 
and physiological responses to bitter tastes, but not sweet 
or amino acid tastes, were restored to normal levels (see 
Figure 15.221). Evidently, receptor proteins uniquely ex- 
pressed in subsets of taste cells encode sweet, amino acid, 
and bitter—judged by taste perception, action potential ac- 
tivity in peripheral nerves, and behavioral responses. This 
specificity and segregation of receptor cells at the periphery 
is apparently maintained in the pathways that relay the in- 
formation to the central nervous system, where information 
about the identity of these primary taste categories remains 
segregated. Given the clear distinctions one makes between 
sweet, sour, bitter, and umami tastes, it seems likely that 
this perceptual clarity established by peripheral receptors 
is maintained by central representations and used to guide 
specific ingestive (sweet, salty, umami) or aversive (sour, 
bitter) behaviors. 
Trigeminal Chemoreception 
The third chemosensory system, the trigeminal chemosen- 
sory system, consists of polymodal nociceptive neurons and 
their axons in the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) and, to 
a lesser degree, nociceptive neurons whose axons run in 
the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves (IX and X). Thus, 
this system can be considered a specialized component of 
the pain- and temperature-sensing somatosensory path- 
ways in the head and neck (see Chapter 10), particularly 
the trigeminal pain system. The irritant-sensitive polymo- 
dal nociceptors of the trigeminal system help alert the or- 
ganism to potentially harmful chemical stimuli that either 
have been respired or have come in contact with the face at 
high environmental concentrations. The peripheral receptor 
neurons and their associated endings are typically activated 
by relatively high concentrations of irritating chemicals that 
come into direct contact with the mucous membranes of the 
head, including the mouth, nose, and eyes. Stimuli for the 
trigeminal chemosensory system include air pollutants such 
as sulfur dioxide, ammonia (smelling salts), ethanol (li- 
quor), acetic acid (vinegar), carbon dioxide (in soft drinks), 
menthol (in various inhalant sensations), and capsaicin (the 
compound in hot chili peppers that elicits a characteristic 
burning sensation; see Box 10A). 
The receptors for irritants are located primarily on the 
terminal branches of polymodal nociceptive neurons, as 
described for the pain and temperature systems in Chap- 
ter 10. With the exception of capsaicin and acidic stimuli, 
both of which activate cation-selective TRP channels, little 
is known about either the transduction mechanisms for 
irritants or their central processing. Each of these classes 
of compounds can also be detected by the olfactory and 
THE CHEMICAL SENSES 
349 
gustatory systems. The concentration thresholds that ac- 
tivate trigeminal chemosensory endings versus specialized 
olfactory and taste receptors, however, are significantly 
higher, and it is likely that the majority of these stimuli are 
transduced via distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms 
by the trigeminal chemosensory system. 
Most trigeminal chemosensory information from the 
face, scalp, cornea, and mucous membranes of the oral 
and nasal cavities is relayed via the three major sensory 
branches of the trigeminal nerve: ophthalmic, maxillary, 
and mandibular. The central target of these afferent axons is 
the spinal component of the trigeminal nucleus, which re- 
lays this information to the ventral posterior medial nucleus 
of the thalamus and thence to the somatic sensory cortex 
and other cortical areas that process facial irritation and 
pain (see Chapter 10). Exposure to irritants triggers a vari- 
ety of physiological responses mediated by the trigeminal 
chemosensory system. These include increased salivation, 
vasodilation, tearing, nasal secretion, sweating, decreased 
respiratory rate, and bronchoconstriction. Consider, for 
instance, the experience that follows the ingestion of cap- 
saicin (see Box 10A). These reactions are generally protec- 
tive in that they dilute the stimulus (via tearing, salivation, 
sweating) and prevent inhaling or ingesting more of it. 
Summary 
The chemical senses—olfaction, taste, and the trigeminal 
chemosensory system—all contribute to sensing airborne 
or soluble molecules from a variety of sources. Humans and 
other mammals rely on this information for behaviors as di- 
verse as attraction, reproduction, feeding, and avoiding po- 
tentially dangerous circumstances. Receptor neurons in the 
olfactory epithelium transduce chemical stimuli into neu- 
ronal activity by stimulation of a large family of G-protein- 
coupled receptors that elicit second messenger-mediated 
regulation of cation channels. These events generate olfac- 
tory receptor potentials, and ultimately action potentials, 
in the afferent axons of these cells. The large number of 
odorant receptor molecules in most species is believed to 
establish sensitivity to the myriad odors that most animals 
can discriminate. Taste receptor cells, in contrast, use a va- 
riety of mechanisms for transducing a more limited range 
of chemical stimuli. Each of the five perceptual catego- 
ries of taste—salty, sour, sweet, amino acids (also known 
as umami), and bitter—is encoded by receptor cells that 
express distinct receptor proteins. Salts and protons (ac- 
ids) directly activate two different ion channels, and there 
are specific sets of G-protein-coupled receptors for sweet, 
amino acid, and bitter tastes. The trigeminal chemosensory 
system transduces irritants via free nerve endings in facial 
mucous membranes that are in many ways similar to those 
that encode pain and temperature information in the skin. 
Olfaction, taste, and trigeminal chemosensation all are 

350 
CHAPTER 15 
relayed via specific pathways in the central nervous system. 
Olfactory receptor neurons project directly to the olfactory 
bulb. In the taste system, cranial sensory ganglion neurons 
relay information from taste cells to the solitary nucleus in 
the brainstem. In the trigeminal chemosensory system, in- 
formation is relayed via trigeminal ganglion cell projections 
to the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the brainstem. Each of 
these structures projects in turn to many sites in the brain,

Control 
MOVEMENTS, WHETHER VOLUNTARY or involuntary, are 
produced by spatial and temporal patterns of muscular contrac- 
tions orchestrated by neural circuits in the brain and spinal cord. 
Analysis of these circuits is fundamental to an understanding of 
both normal behavior and the etiology of a variety of neurologi- 
cal disorders. This unit considers the brainstem and spinal cord 
circuitry that make elementary reflex movements possible, as 
well as the circuits that organize the intricate patterns of neural 
activity responsible for more complex motor acts. 
Ultimately, the "lower" motor neurons in the spinal cord and 
brainstem directly innervate skeletal muscles, thus initiating all 
movement produced by the skeletal musculature. Lower motor 
neurons are controlled directly by local circuits within the spinal 
cord and brainstem that coordinate different muscle groups, 
and indirectly by "upper" motor neurons in higher centers 
that regulate those local circuits. The autonomic divisions of 
the visceral motor system organize the innervation of visceral 
smooth muscles, cardiac muscle, and glandular secretions by a 
similar network of neurons in both lower and higher centers of 
the nervous system. This pattern of circuitry enables and coor- 
dinates complex sequences of bodily movements and ensures 
appropriate autonomic activity in support of these movements. 
Circuits in the basal ganglia and cerebellum regulate upper 
motor neurons, facilitating the initiation and performance of 
movement with spatial and temporal precision. 
The various symptoms of movement disorders often signify 
damage to particular brain regions. For example, the clinically 
important neurodegenerative disorders amyotrophic lateral scle- 
rosis, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are the result 
of pathological changes in different parts of the motor system. 
Thus, knowledge of the various levels of motor control is essen- 
tial for understanding, diagnosing, and treating these diseases.

CONTROL 
Overview 
SKELETAL MUSCLE CONTRACTION is initiated by "lower" motor neurons in the 
spinal cord and brainstem. The cell bodies of the lower neurons are located in the ven- 
tral horn of the spinal cord gray matter and in the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves 
in the brainstem. These neurons (also called a motor neurons) send axons directly 
to skeletal muscles via the ventral roots and spinal peripheral nerves or, in the case 
of brainstem motor nuclei, via cranial nerves. The spatial and temporal patterns of 
activation of lower motor neurons are determined primarily by local circuits located 
within the spinal cord and brainstem. The local circuit neurons receive direct input 
from sensory neurons and mediate sensory-motor reflexes; they also maintain pre- 
cise interconnections that enable the coordination of a rich repertoire of rhythmical 
and stereotyped behavior. Descending pathways from higher centers comprise the 
axons of "upper" motor neurons that modulate the activity of lower motor neurons 
by influencing this local circuitry. The cell bodies of upper motor neurons are located 
in brainstem centers, such as the vestibular nuclei, superior colliculus, and reticular 
formation, as well as in the cerebral cortex, which govern volitional aspects of move- 
ment. The axons of the upper motor neurons typically contact the local circuit neurons 
in the brainstem and spinal cord, which, via relatively short axons, in turn, contact the 
appropriate combinations of lower motor neurons. Lower motor neurons, therefore, 
are the final common pathway for transmitting information from a variety of sources 
to the skeletal muscles. Comparable circuits of interneurons and lower motor neurons 
may be recognized within the divisions of the visceral motor system, but consideration 
of these motor circuits will be reserved for Chapter 21; with this exception, the principal 
context for our exploration of the central control of 
movement will be those movements 
that are executed by musculoskeletal systems. 
Neural Centers Responsible for Movement 
The neural circuits responsible for the control of movement can be divided into four 
distinct but highly interactive subsystems, each of which makes a unique contribu- 
tion to motor control (Figure 16.1). The first of these subsystems is the local circuitry 
within the gray matter of the spinal cord and the tegmentum of the brainstem.

FIGURE 16.1 
Organization of neural structures involved in 
the control of movement. Four systems—t!ocal spinal cord and 
brainstem circuits, descending control pathways, the cerebellum, 
and the basal ganglia—make essential and distinct contributions 
to motor control. 
The relevant cells include the lower motor neurons (which 
send their axons out of the brainstem and spinal cord to 
innervate the skeletal muscles of the head and body, re- 
spectively) and the local circuit neurons (which are the 
major source of synaptic input to the lower motor neu- 
rons). All commands for movement, whether reflexive or 
voluntary, are ultimately conveyed to the muscles by the 
activity of the lower motor neurons; thus, these neurons 
comprise, in the words of the great British neurophysi- 
ologist Charles Sherrington, the "final common path" for 
initiating movement. The local circuit neurons receive sen- 
sory inputs as well as descending projections from higher 
centers. Thus, the circuits they form provide much of the 
coordination between different muscle groups that is es- 
sential for organized movement. Even after the spinal cord 
is disconnected from the brain in an experimental ani- 
mal, appropriate stimulation of local spinal circuits elicits 
involuntary but highly coordinated limb movements that 
resemble walking. 
The second motor subsystem consists of the upper 
motor neurons, whose cell bodies lie in the brainstem or 
cerebral cortex and whose axons descend to synapse with 
the local circuit neurons or (more rarely) with the lower 
motor neurons directly. The upper motor neuron path- 
ways that arise in the cortex are essential for the initiation 
of voluntary movements and for complex spatiotemporal 
sequences of skilled movements. In particular, descend- 
ing projections from cortical areas in the frontal lobe, in- 
cluding Brodmann's area 4 (the primary motor cortex) 
and several divisions of premotor cortex in Brodmann's 
area 6, are essential for planning, initiating, and directing 
sequences of voluntary movements involving the head, 
trunk, and limbs. The frontal lobe also contains cortical 
areas that play a similar role in the control of eye move- 
ments. In addition, cortical areas in the anterior cingulate 
gyrus (Brodmann's area 24) govern the expression of emo- 
tions, especially with respect to the facial musculature. 
Upper motor neurons originating in the brainstem are re- 
sponsible for regulating muscle tone and for orienting the 
eyes, head, and body with respect to vestibular, somatic, 
auditory, and visual sensory information. Their contribu- 
tions are thus critical for basic navigational movements 
and for the control of posture. 
The third and fourth subsystems are complex circuits 
with output pathways that have no direct access to either 
the local circuit neurons or the lower motor neurons; in- 
stead, they control movement by regulating the activity of 
the upper motor neurons. The larger of these subsystems, 
the cerebellum, overlies the pons and fourth ventricle in 
the posterior cranium (see Appendix Figure A12). The cer- 
ebellum acts via its efferent pathways to the upper motor 
neurons as a servomechanism, detecting and attenuating 
the difference, or "motor error," between an intended 
movement and the movement actually performed. The 
cerebellum uses this information about discrepancies to 
mediate both real-time and long-term reductions in these 
inevitable motor errors (the latter being a form of motor 
learning). As might be expected from this account, pa- 
tients with cerebellar damage exhibit persistent errors in 
ongoing movement. 
Lastly, embedded in the depths of the forebrain, is a 
group of structures collectively referred to as the basal 
ganglia. The basal ganglia suppress unwanted movements 
and prepare upper motor neuron circuits for the initiation 
of movements. The problems associated with disorders of 
basal ganglia, such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's 
disease, attest to the importance of this complex in the ini- 
tiation of voluntary movements (see Chapter 18). 
Despite much effort, the sequence of events that leads 
from thought and emotion to movement is still poorly 
understood. The picture is clearest, however, at the level 
of control of the skeletal muscles themselves. It therefore 
makes sense to begin an account of motor behavior by con- 
sidering the anatomical and physiological relationships be- 
tween lower motor neurons and the striated muscle fibers 
they innervate. 

LOWER MOTOR NEURON CIRCUITS AND MOTOR CONTROL 
355 
Motor Neuron-Muscle Relationships 
An orderly relationship between the location of motor neu- 
ron pools and the muscles they innervate is evident both 
along the length of the spinal cord and across the medial- 
to-lateral dimension of the cord, an arrangement that, in 
effect, provides a spatial map of the body's musculature. 
This map can be demonstrated in animal experiments by 
injecting individual muscle groups with visible tracers that 
are transported by the axons of the lower motor neurons 
from their terminals back to their cell bodies; the lower 
motor neurons that innervate each of the body's skeletal 
muscles can then be seen in histological sections of the 
ventral horns of the spinal cord. Each lower motor neuron 
innervates muscle fibers within a single muscle, and all the 
motor neurons innervating a single muscle (called the mo- 
tor neuron pool for that muscle) are grouped together into 
a rod-shaped cluster that runs parallel to the long axis of the 
spinal cord for one or more spinal cord segments (Figure 
16.2). For example, the motor neuron pools that innervate 
the arm are located in the cervical enlargement of the cord,

Distribution of lower motor neurons

were identified by injecting a retrograde tracer into either 
the medial gastrocnemius or soleus muscle of the cat, 
thus labeling neuronal cell bodies and revealing their spa- 
tial distribution. A transverse section through the lumbar 
level of the spinal cord (A) shows lower motor neurons 
forming distinct clusters (motor pools) in the ipsilateral 
ventral horn. Spinal cord cross sections (B) and a recon- 
struction seen from the dorsal surface (C) illustrate the dis- 
tribution of motor neurons innervating individual skeletal 
muscles in both axes of the cord. The cylindrical shape 
and distinct distribution of different pools are especially 
evident in the dorsal view of the reconstructed cord. The 
dashed lines in (C) represent individual lumbar and sacral 
spinal cord segments. (After Burke et al, 1977.) 
gastrocnemius 
and those that innervate the leg are located in the lumbar 
enlargement (see the Appendix). The mapping, or topogra- 
phy, of motor neuron pools in the medial-to-lateral dimen- 
sion can be appreciated in a cross section through the cervi- 
cal enlargement (Figure 16.3). The map shows neurons that 
innervate the axial musculature (i.e., the postural muscles 
of the trunk) are located medially in the spinal cord. Lateral 
to these cell groups are motor neuron pools innervating 
muscles located progressively more laterally in the body. 
Thus, neurons that innervate the muscles of the shoulders 
(or pelvis, if one were to look at a similar section in the lum- 
bar enlargement; see Figure 16.2) are the next most lateral 
group, whereas those that innervate the proximal muscles 
of the arm (or leg) are located laterally to these. The motor 
neuron pools that innervate the distal parts of the extremi- 
ties, the fingers or toes, lie farthest from the midline. 
This spatial organization of motor neuron pools in the 
ventral horn provides a framework for understanding the 
control of the body's musculature in posture and move- 
ment, as well as how descending projections of upper 
motor neurons and intersegmental spinal cord circuits

level of the spinal cord, illustrating that the motor neurons inner-

are organized to modulate motor behavior. Thus, medial 
motor neuronal pools that govern postural control and the 
maintenance of balance receive input from upper motor 
neurons via long projection systems that run in the medial 
and anterior (ventral) white matter of the spinal cord. The 
more lateral motor neuron pools that innervate the dis- 
tal extremities are often concerned with the execution of 
skilled behavior; this is especially true of 
the lateral motor neurons of the cervi- 
cal enlargement that innervate muscles 
of the forearm and hand in primates. 
These laterally placed lower motor neu- 
rons are governed by projections from 
motor divisions of the cerebral cortex 
axons terminate along the entire length of the cord and help 
mediate posture. Moreover, many of these neurons have 
axonal branches that cross the midline in the commissure 
of the spinal cord to innervate lower motor neurons in the 
medial part of the contralateral hemicord. This arrange- 
ment ensures that groups of axial muscles on both sides 
of the body act in concert to maintain and adjust posture. 
In contrast, local circuit neurons in the lateral region of the 
intermediate zone have shorter axons that typically extend 
fewer than five segments and are predominantly ipsilateral. 
This more restricted pattern of connectivity provides the 
finer and more differentiated control that is exerted over 
the muscles of the distal extremities, such as that required 
for the independent movement of individual fingers during 
manipulative tasks. 
Two types of lower motor neurons are found in the motor 
neuronal pools of the ventral horn. Small y motor neurons 
innervate specialized muscle fibers that, in combination with 
the nerve fibers that innervate them, are actually sensory 
receptors called muscle spindles (see Chapter 9). The muscle 
spindles are embedded within connective tissue capsules 
in the muscle and are thus referred to as intrafusal muscle 
fibers (fusal means capsular). The intrafusal muscle fibers 
are also innervated by sensory axons that send information 
to the spinal cord and brainstem about 
the length of the muscle. The function 
of the y motor neurons is to regulate this 
sensory input by setting the intrafusal 
muscle fibers to an appropriate length 
(see the next section). The second type of 
lower motor neuron, the & motor neu- 
rons, innervates the extrafusal muscle fi- 
Commissural 
axons 
that, in primates, run through the lat- 
eral white matter of the spinal cord. 
This same somatotopic plan is reflected 
in the connections made by local spinal 
cord circuits that interconnect neurons 
distributed along the longitudinal axis 
of the spinal cord (Figure 16.4). Thus, 
the patterns of connections made by 
local circuit neurons in the medial re- 
gion of the intermediate zone are differ- 
ent from the patterns made by those in 
the lateral region, and these differences 
are related to their respective functions. 
The medial local circuit neurons, which 
supply the lower motor neurons in the 
medial ventral horn, have axons that 
project to many spinal cord segments. 
Indeed, some projections run between 
the cervical and lumbar enlargements 
and participate in the coordination of 
rhythmic movements of the upper and 
lower limbs (see "Spinal Cord Circuitry 
and Locomotion," p. 371), while other

FIGURE 16.4 
Local circuit neurons in 
the spinal cord gray matter. Local cir- 
cuit neurons that supply the medial region 
of the ventral horn are situated medially 
within the intermediate zone of the spinal 
cord gray matter. Their axons extend over a 
number of spinal cord segments and termi- 
nate bilaterally. Those local circuit neurons 
that supply the lateral parts of the ventral 
horn are located more laterally; their axons 
extend over a few spinal cord segments, 
always terminating on the same side of the 
cord as the cell body. Pathways that contact 
the medial parts of the spinal cord gray 
matter are involved primarily in the control 
of posture; those that contact the lateral 
parts are involved in the fine control of the 
distal extremities. 

LOWER MOTOR NEURON CIRCUITS AND MOTOR CONTROL 
357 
Although the following discussion focuses on the lower 
motor neurons in the spinal cord, comparable sets of motor 
neurons responsible for the control of muscles in the head 
and neck are located in the brainstem. The latter neurons 
are distributed in the eight somatic and branchial motor 
nuclei of the cranial nerves in the medulla, pons, and mid- 
brain (see Appendix Figure A8). Somewhat confusingly, but 
quite appropriately, these motor neurons in the brainstem 
are also called lower motor neurons. 
The Motor Unit 
Most extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers in mature mammals 
are innervated by only a single a motor neuron (developing 
muscle fibers are innervated by several a motor neurons; 
see Chapter 23). Since there are by far more muscle fibers 
than motor neurons, individual motor axons branch within 
muscles to synapse on many extrafusal fibers. These fibers 
are typically distributed over a relatively wide area within 
the muscle, presumably to ensure that the contractile force 
is spread evenly (Figure 16.5). In addition, this arrangement 
reduces the chance that damage to one or a few a motor 
neurons will significantly alter a muscle's action. Because

Muscle fibers innervated 
by a single & motor neuron 
an action potential generated by a motor neuron normally 
brings to threshold all of the muscle fibers it contacts, a 
single & motor neuron and its associated muscle fibers 
constitute the smallest unit of force that can be activated 
to produce movement. Sherrington was again the first to 
recognize this fundamental relationship between an a mo- 
tor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates, for which he 
coined the term motor unit. 
Both motor units and the a motor neurons themselves 
vary in size. Small a motor neurons innervate relatively 
few muscle fibers to form motor units that generate small 
forces, whereas large motor neurons innervate larger, more 
powerful motor units. Motor units also differ in the types of 
muscle fibers that they innervate. In most skeletal muscles, 
the smaller motor units comprise small "red" muscle fibers 
that contract slowly and generate relatively small forces; 
but, because of their rich myoglobin content, plentiful mi- 
tochondria, and rich capillary beds, these small red fibers 
are resistant to fatigue. These small units are called slow 
(S) motor units and are especially important for activi- 
ties that require sustained muscular contraction, such as 
the maintenance of an upright posture. Larger a motor 
neurons innervate larger, pale muscle fibers that generate 
more force; however, these fibers have sparse mitochondria 
and are therefore easily fatigued. These units are called fast 
fatigable (FF) motor units and are especially important for 
brief exertions that require large forces, such as running or 
jumping. A third class of motor unit has properties that lie 
between those of the other two. These fast fatigue-resis- 
tant (FR) motor units are of intermediate size and are not 
quite as fast as FF motor units. They generate about twice 
the force of a slow motor unit and, as the name implies, are 
resistant to fatigue (Figure 16.6). 
These distinctions among different types of motor unit 
explain how the nervous system produces movements 
appropriate for different circumstances. In most muscles, 
small, S motor units have lower thresholds for activation 
than do the larger units and are tonically active during mo- 
tor acts that require sustained effort (standing, for instance). 
The thresholds for the large, fast motor units are reached

Note the strikingly different fatigue rates. (After Burke et al., 1974.) 
only when rapid movements requiring great force are made, 
such as jumping. 
The functional distinctions between the various classes of 
motor unit also explain some structural differences among 
muscle groups. For example, a motor unit in the soleus (a 
muscle important for posture that comprises mostly small 
motor units) has an average innervation ratio of 180 muscle 
fibers for each motor neuron. In contrast, the gastrocnemius, 
a muscle that comprises both small and larger motor units, 
has an innervation ratio of 1000-2000 muscle fibers per motor 
neuron and can generate forces needed for sudden changes 
in body position. Other differences are related to the highly 
specialized functions of particular muscles. For instance, the 
eyes require rapid, precise movements that are generated 
by small forces; in consequence, extraocular muscle motor 
units are extremely small (with an average innervation ratio 
of only 3 fibers per unit) and have a very high proportion of 
muscle fibers capable of contracting with maximal velocity. 
More subtle motor unit variations are present in athletes on 
different training regimens; indeed, both the myofibril and 
neuronal properties of motor units are subject to use-depen- 
dent plasticity. This potential for change in part underlies 
neuromuscular adaptations to physical exercise (Box 16A). 
Thus, muscle biopsies show that sprinters have a larger pro- 
portion of powerful, but rapidly fatiguing, pale fibers in their 
leg muscles than do marathon runners.

The Regulation of Muscle Force 
Increasing or decreasing the number of motor units active 
at any one time changes the amount of force produced by 
a muscle. In the 1960s, Elwood Henneman and his col- 
leagues at Harvard Medical School found that progressive 
increases in muscle tension could be produced by progres- 
sively increasing the activity of axons that provide input 
to the relevant pool of lower motor neurons. This gradual 
increase in tension results from the recruitment of motor 
units in a fixed order, according to their size. By stimulating 
either sensory nerves or upper motor pathways that project 
to a lower motor neuron pool while measuring the tension 
changes in the muscle, Henneman found that, in experi- 
mental animals, only the smallest motor units in the pool 
are activated by weak synaptic stimulation. When synaptic 
input to the motor pool increases, progressively larger mo- 
tor units that generate larger forces are recruited. Thus, as 
the synaptic activity driving a motor neuron pool increases, 
low threshold S motor units are recruited first, then FR 
motor units, and finally, at the highest levels of activity, 
the FF motor units. Since these original experiments were 
performed, evidence for the orderly recruitment of motor 
units has been found in a variety of voluntary and reflexive 
movements, including exercise activities. This systematic 
relationship has come to be known as the size principle. 
An illustration of how the size principle operates for the 
motor units of the medial gastrocnemius muscle in the cat 
is shown in Figure 16.7. When the animal is standing qui- 
etly, the force measured directly from the muscle tendon 
is only a small fraction (about 5%) of the total force that 
the muscle can generate. The force is provided by the S 
motor units, which make up about 25% of the motor units 
in this muscle. When the cat begins to walk, larger forces 
are necessary. Locomotor activities that range from slow

Motor neuron recruitment in the cat medial gastrocnemius muscle

required for standing. Fast fatigue-resistant (FR) motor units provide the additional force 
needed for walking and running. Fast fatigable (FF) motor units are recruited for the most 
strenuous activities, such as jumping. (After Walmsley et al., 1978.) 
359 
walking to fast running require up to 25% 
of the muscle's total force capacity. This 
additional need is met by the recruitment 
of FR motor units. Only movements such 
as galloping and jumping, which are per- 
formed infrequently and for short periods, 
require the full power of the muscle; such 
demands are met by the recruitment of 
the FF motor units. Thus, the size principle 
provides a simple solution to the problem 
of grading muscle force. The combination 
of motor units activated by such orderly 
recruitment optimally matches the physi- 
ological properties of different motor unit 
types with the range of forces required to 
perform different motor tasks.

BOX 16A Motor Unit Plasticity 
Organisms with complex nervous sys- 
tems demonstrate an astounding ability 
to acquire new motor skills and modify 
the strength and endurance of motor 
behavior. The neural basis of these abil- 
ities depends heavily on the operations 
of supraspinal motor centers (i.e., neu- 
ral centers above the spinal cord) whose 
functions in volitional motor behavior 
and motor learning are described in 
Chapters 17-19. But what role—if 
any—do the motor units themselves 
play in the functional changes that 
underlie such abilities? Are motor units 
subject to use-dependent plasticity and, 
if so, to what extent are the anatomical 
and physiological properties of motor 
units changeable? To address these 
questions, it is necessary to consider in

When considering the structure 
and function of skeletal muscle, it is 
convenient to classify the constituent 
motor units into one of three catego- 
ries: slow (S), fast fatigable (FF), or fast 
fatigue-resistant (FR) (see Figure 16.6). 
However, with increasingly sophisticat- 
ed means of characterizing the intrinsic 
architecture, biochemistry, and physi- 
ology of muscle fibers, it has become 
clear that most skeletal muscles possess 
a broad spectrum of fiber phenotypes 
that vary in speed of contraction, ten- 
sion generation, oxidative capacity, and 
endurance. These variations among 
muscle fibers combine with correspond- 
ing variations in the morphological

and biophysical properties of a motor 
neurons to determine the size and 
physiological function of motor units 
(Figure A). Thus, the features of a 
motor neurons that serve small motor 
units explain why such neurons are 
easily depolarized to firing threshold, 
but typically maintain only slower and 
steady rates of firing—properties that 
are well suited for the control of slow 
muscle fibers that mediate postural 
stability. On the other hand, a motor 
neurons that serve large motor units are 
more difficult to depolarize to threshold 
but are capable of achieving high rates 
of firing upon activation—properties 
consistent with the force-generating 
potential of FF muscle fibers that are 
recruited for production of maximal 
tension. (Not surprisingly, muscle fibers 
that are intermediate in their functional 
properties are supplied by a motor 
neurons whose phenotype is midway 
between these extremes.) 
An early answer to the question 
of motor unit plasticity came from a 
classic series of "cross-innervation" 
experiments performed by the great 
Australian physiologist J. C. Eccles and 
his colleagues, most notably A. J. Buller. 
The results demonstrated that the 
physiological properties of slow and fast

fatigable fibers (circle) and fast fatigue-resistant fibers (square)

Following 56 days of chronic electrical nerve stimulation, nearly 
all fibers acquired the histochemical phenotype of slow oxida- 
tive fibers. (C) The electrophysiological properties of the a motor 
neurons supplying the stimulated nerve also shifted toward 
those more characteristic of the slower motor units of the soleus 
muscle (SOL). The upper scatterplot shows control data in which 
the faster motor units of the medial gastrocnemius are differ- 
entiated from the slower motor units of the soleus muscle by 
shorter neuronal after-hyperpolarizations and time-to-peak ten- 
sion in the supplied muscle fibers. The lower graph shows the 
impact of chronic stimulation, which shifts the properties of MG 
motor neurons toward those seen in SOL motor neurons. (B from 
Gordon et al., 1997; C from Munson et al., 1997.) 
muscle fibers could be reversed when 
_ the innervation to these fibers was sur- 
- gically altered so that slow muscle fibers 
- were innervated by a nerve that nor- 
_ mally supplies fast fibers, and vice versa. 
Subsequent studies by other investiga- 
_ tors demonstrated that the actual pat- 
_ tern of neural activity in a motor nerve, 
in addition to—or perhaps instead 
of—the identity of the innervating 
motor neurons themselves, provides an 
_ 
instructive signal that can influence the 
expression of muscle fiber phenotype. 
_ 
For example, chronic electrical nerve 
stimulation transforms the metabolic 
and contractile properties of FF fibers to 
those consistent with S fibers (Figures 
B and C). Corresponding changes were 
also observed in the biophysical prop- 
erties of the a motor neurons whose 
axons were stimulated. Although the 
| 
effects were more subtle, stimulated a 
motor neurons were modified toward 
slow, fatigue-resistant motor units, 
with increased excitability, lengthened 
after-hyperpolarizations, and short-term 
depression of EPSP amplitudes follow- 
ing high-frequency activation. 
It is much more difficult to con- 
trol and interpret studies of exercising 
organisms; nevertheless, the same gen- 
eral principles of motor unit plasticity 
that were derived from nerve stimula- 
tion studies apply to neuromuscular

adaptation in more naturalistic contexts, 
including resistance and endurance 
training. Thus, the nature and degree of 
adaptation following exercise is a func- 
tion of the tensions exerted by muscle 
fibers and the duration of increased 
muscle activity. Most commonly, exer- 
cise regimes can "slow" the contractile 
properties of motor units while increas- 
ing the endurance and strength of 
muscle fibers. However, the impact of 
exercise is distributed proportionately to 
motor units in order of their recruitment 
during training activities, with S motor 
units being affected most at low exertion 
levels, and FR and FF motor units being 
affected only if recruited by higher inten- 
sities of exercise. 
Interestingly, neural contributions 
to exercise-induced changes in per- 
formance are not limited to alterations 
of motor unit phenotype. Indeed, the 
increase in strength achieved in the 
early phases of resistance training often 
exceeds what can be attributable to 
changes in the structure and function of 
muscle fibers, implying the operation of 
spinal and/or supraspinal neural mecha- 
nisms that mediate increased motor 
function. At the motor unit level, these 
neural adaptations include an increase

ies of unilateral exercise (e.g., training 
one arm and not the other) have shown 
appreciable gains in the non-exercised 
limb, indicating the recruitment and 
adaptation of central neural circuits that 
have access to contralateral motor units. 
There are even documented gains in 
muscle strength with imagined exercise— 
a provocative result that may eventually 
have profound implications for athletic 
training and rehabilitation science. 
There is still much to be learned 
about how motor units respond to use 
alterations in strength and endurance

ning to probe the neurobiological and 
neuromuscular mechanisms that under- 
lie skill acquisition. Pursuit of these 
aims will surely lead to a better under-

FIGURE 16.9 
The number of active motor units and their 
rate of firing both increase with voluntary force. Motor 
unit firing in a muscle of the human hand (each unit is represent- 
ed here by a single trace) was recorded transcutaneously as the 
amount of voluntary force produced by the subject progressively 
increased. The lowest threshold motor units generate the least 
amount of voluntary force and are recruited first. As the subject 
generates more and more force, both the number and the rate 
of firing of active motor units increase. (Note that all motor units 
fire initially at about 8 Hz.) (After Monster and Chan, 1977.) 
(Figure 16.9). As the firing rate of individual units rises 
(to a maximum of 20-25 per second in the muscle being 
studied here), the amount of force produced increases. At 
the highest firing rates, individual muscle fibers are in a 
state of "fused tetanus"—that is, the tension produced in 
individual motor units no longer has peaks and troughs 
that correspond to the individual twitches evoked by the 
motor neuron's action potentials. 
Under normal conditions, the maximum firing rate of 
motor neurons is less than that required for fused tetanus 
(see Figure 16.8). However, the asynchronous firing of dif- 
ferent lower motor neurons provides a steady level of input 
to the muscle, which causes the contraction of a relatively 
constant number of motor units, and averages out the 
changes in tension due to contractions and relaxations of 
individual motor units. All this allows the resulting move- 
ments to be executed smoothly. 
The Spinal Cord Circuitry Underlying 
Muscle Stretch Reflexes 
Local circuitry within the spinal cord mediates a number of 
sensory motor reflex actions. The simplest of these reflex 
arcs entails a sensory response to muscle stretch, which 
provides direct excitatory input to the motor neurons in- 
nervating the muscle that has been stretched. As already 
mentioned, the sensory signal for the stretch reflex origi- 
nates in muscle spindles, the sensory receptors embed- 
ded within most muscles. The spindles comprise eight to 
ten intrafusal fibers arranged in parallel with the extrafusal 
fibers that make up the bulk of the muscle (Figure 16.10A). 
There are two structural and functional classes of in- 
trafusal fibers: nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers; 
the nuclear bag fibers can be subdivided further into two 
subclasses (dynamic and static; see below). The two classes 
differ in the arrangement of their nuclei (giving rise to their 
nomenclature, bag and chain fibers), the intrinsic archi- 
tecture of their myofibrils, and their dynamic sensitivity to 
stretch. Most muscle spindles contain two or three nuclear 
bag fibers and at least twice that many nuclear chain fibers. 
Large-diameter sensory axons (group Ia afferents; see Table 
9.1) are coiled around the central part of each class of intra- 
fusal fiber, forming so-called "annulospiral" primary end- 
ings (see Figure 16.10A). Nearly as large in diameter are the 
eroup II afferents, which form secondary endings, mainly 
on nuclear chain fibers; these are referred to as "flower- 
spray" endings because of their short, petal-like contacts 
just outside the middle region of the fiber. Taken together, 
group Ia and group II afferents are the largest axons in pe- 
ripheral nerves and, because action potential conduction 
velocity is a direct function of axon diameter (see Chapters 
2 and 3), they mediate very rapid reflex adjustments when 
the muscle is stretched. The stretch imposed on the muscle 
deforms the intrafusal muscle fibers, which in turn initiates 
action potentials by activating mechanically gated ion chan- 
nels in the afferent axons innervating the spindle. 
Group Ia afferents tend to respond phasically to small 
stretches. This is because la afferent activity is dominated 
by signals transduced by the dynamic subtype of nuclear 
bag fiber whose biomechanical properties emphasize the 
velocity of fiber stretch. Group II afferents, which innervate 
static nuclear bag fibers and the nuclear chain fibers, signal 
the level of sustained fiber stretch by firing tonically at a 
frequency in proportion to the degree of stretch, with little 
dynamic sensitivity. The centrally projecting branch of the 
sensory neuron forms monosynaptic excitatory connections 
with those a motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spi- 
nal cord that innervate the same (homonymous) muscle 
and, via local circuit neurons, forms inhibitory connections 
with those & motor neurons that innervate antagonistic 
(heteronymous) muscles. This arrangement is an example 
of reciprocal innervation and results in rapid contrac- 
tion of the stretched muscle and simultaneous relaxation

muscle spindle, the sensory receptor that initiates the stretch 
reflex. (B) Stretching a muscle spindle leads to increased activity 
in la afferents and an increase in the activity of « motor neurons 
that innervate the same muscle. la afferents also excite the motor 
neurons that innervate synergistic muscles, and they indirectly 
inhibit the motor neurons that innervate antagonists (see Figures 
1.7-1.9). (C) The stretch reflex operates as a negative feedback 
loop to regulate muscle length.

of the antagonist muscle. This pattern of activity leads to 
especially rapid and efficient adjustments to changes in the 
length of the muscle (Figure 16.10B). The excitatory path- 
way from a spindle to the a motor neurons innervating the 
same muscle is unusual in that it is a monosynaptic reflex; 
in most cases, sensory neurons from the periphery do not 
contact the lower motor neuron directly but instead exert 
their effects through local circuit neurons. 
This monosynaptic reflex arc is variously referred to as 
the "stretch," "deep tendon," or "myotatic" reflex, and it is 
the basis of the knee, ankle, jaw, biceps, or triceps response 
tested in a routine physical examination. The tap of the reflex 
hammer on the tendon stretches the muscle, which evokes 
an afferent volley of activity in the Ia sensory axons that in- 
nervate the muscle spindles. The afferent volley is relayed to 
the a motor neurons in the brainstem or spinal cord, and an 
efferent volley returns to the muscle (see Figure 1.7). Since 
muscles are always under some degree of stretch, this reflex 
circuit, mediated largely by Group II afferents, is normally 
responsible for the steady level of tension in muscles called 
muscle tone. Changes in muscle tone occur in a variety of 
pathological conditions, and these changes are assessed by 
examination of deep tendon reflexes (see Box 17E). 
In terms of engineering principles, the stretch reflex arc is 
a negative feedback loop used to maintain muscle length at a 
desired value (Figure 16.10C). The appropriate muscle length 
is specified by the activity of descending upper motor neuron 
pathways that influence the lower motor neuron pool. De- 
viations from the desired length are detected by the muscle 
spindles, since increases or decreases in the stretch of the 
intrafusal fibers alter the level of activity in the sensory axons 
that innervate the spindles. These changes lead, in turn, to 
adjustments in the activity of the a motor neurons, returning 
the muscle to the desired length by contracting the stretched 
muscle and relaxing the opposing muscle group, and by re- 
storing the level of spindle activity to what it was before. 
The smaller y motor neurons control the functional 
characteristics of the muscle spindles by modulating their 
level of excitability. As described earlier, when the mus- 
cle is stretched, the spindle is also stretched and the rate 
of discharge in the afferent fibers is increased. When the 
muscle shortens, the spindle is relieved of tension ("un- 
loaded") and the sensory axons that innervate the spindle 
might therefore be expected to fall silent, but in fact they 
remain active. The y motor neurons terminate on the con- 
tractile poles of the intrafusal fibers, and the activation of 
these neurons causes intrafusal fiber contraction—in this 
way, maintaining the tension on the middle, or equatorial 
region, of the intrafusal fibers where the sensory axons ter- 
minate. Just as there are the dynamic and static functional 
classes of intrafusal muscle fibers, there are dynamic and 
static classes of y motor neuron. When dynamic y motor 
neurons fire, the dynamic response of the group Ia affer- 
ent is markedly enhanced. In contrast, when static y motor 
neurons are activated, the dynamic response of the group la 
afferent is reduced and the static response is increased; the 
static response of the group II afferent likewise is enhanced 
under these conditions. Thus, co-activation of & and y mo- 
tor neurons allows spindles to function (i.e., send informa- 
tion centrally) at all muscle lengths during movement and 
postural adjustment. 
The Influence of Sensory Activity 
on Motor Behavior 
The level of y motor neuron activity is often referred to as 
y bias, or gain, and can be adjusted by upper motor neuron 
pathways as well as by local reflex circuitry. The gain of the 
myotatic reflex refers to the amount of muscle force gener- 
ated in response to a given stretch of the intrafusal fibers. If 
the gain of the reflex is high, then a small amount of stretch 
applied to the intrafusal fibers will produce a large increase in 
the number of a motor neurons recruited and a large increase 
in their firing rates; this, in turn, leads to a large increase in 
the amount of tension produced by the extrafusal fibers. If 
the gain is low, a greater stretch is required to generate the 
same amount of tension in the extrafusal muscle fibers. In 
fact, the gain of the stretch reflex is continuously adjusted to 
meet different functional requirements. For example, while 
standing in a moving bus, the gain of the stretch reflex can 
be modulated by upper motor neuron pathways to compen- 
sate for the variable changes that occur as the bus stops and 
starts or progresses relatively smoothly. During voluntary 
stretching, such as warming up for athletic performance, the 
gain of myotatic reflexes must be reduced to facilitate the 
lengthening of muscle fibers and other elastic elements of the 
musculotendinous system that is desirable under these cir- 
cumstances. Thus, under the various demands of voluntary 
(and involuntary) movement, a and y motor neurons are of- 
ten co-activated by higher centers to prevent muscle spindles 
from being unloaded or over-activated (Figure 16.11). 
In addition, the level of y motor neuron activity can be 
modulated independently of a motor neuron activity if the 
context of a movement requires it. In general, the baseline 
activity level of y motor neurons is high if a movement is 
relatively difficult and demands rapid and precise execution. 
For example, recordings from cat hindlimb muscles show 
that y motor neuron activity is high when the animal has 
to perform a difficult movement, such as walking across a 
narrow beam. Unpredictable conditions, as when the ani- 
mal is picked up or handled, also lead to marked increases 
in y motor neuron activity and greatly increased spindle 
responsiveness. 
Gamma motor neuron activity, however, is not the only 
factor that sets the gain of the stretch reflex. The gain also 
depends on the level of excitability of the a motor neu- 
rons that serve as the efferent side of this reflex loop. Thus, 
in addition to the influence of descending upper motor 

LOWER MOTOR NEURON CIRCUITS AND MOTOR CONTROL 
365 
neuron projections, other local circuits in the spinal cord 
can change the gain of the stretch reflex by excitation or 
inhibition of either a or y motor neurons. In addition, there 
are inhibitory interneurons that form axo-axonal synapses 
on the terminals of Ia afferents and are thus positioned to 
selectively suppress the transfer of excitatory drive to spe- 
cific subpopulations of lower motor neurons. 
. 
The activities of local circuits in the spinal cord are them- 
selves influenced by the projections of upper motor neurons 
in the brainstem and cerebral cortex, as well as by neuro- 
modulatory systems that originate in the brainstem reticu- 
lar formation, as described in the next chapter. Many of 
these neuromodulatory projections release biogenic amine 
neurotransmitters that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors 
(A) o Motor neuron activation without y 
and mediate long-lasting effects on the gain of segmental 
circuits in the spinal cord. 
Other Sensory Feedback Affecting 
Motor Performance 
Another sensory receptor that is important in the reflex 
regulation of motor unit activity is the Golgi tendon organ. 
Golgi tendon organs are encapsulated afferent nerve end- 
ings located at the junction of a muscle and a tendon (Figure 
16.12A). Each tendon organ is innervated by a single group 
Ib sensory axon (Ib axons are slightly smaller than the Ia

contrast to the parallel arrangement of extrafusal muscle fi-

of the change in length occurs in the muscle 
fibers, since they are more elastic than the 
fibrils of the tendon. When a muscle actively 
contracts, however, the force acts directly 
on the tendon, leading to an increase in the 
tension of the collagen fibrils in the tendon 
organ and compression of the intertwined 
sensory receptors. As a result, Golgi tendon 
organs are exquisitely sensitive to increases 
in muscle tension that arise from muscle con- 
traction but, unlike spindles, are relatively 
insensitive to passive stretch (Figure 16.12B).

the muscle. This reflex circuit also operates 
at reduced levels of muscle force, counter-

muscle shortening. Thus, the y motor neurons 
can regulate the gain of muscle spindles so they 
can operate efficiently at any length of the parent 
muscle. (After Hunt and Kuffler, 1951.)

Muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. 
(A) Golgi tendon organs (GTO) are arranged in series with extra- 
fusal muscle fibers because of their location at the junction of 
muscle and tendon. (B) The two types of muscle receptors, the 
muscle spindles (1) and the Golgi tendon organs (2), have differ- 
ent responses to passive muscle stretch (top) and active muscle 
contraction (bottom). Both afferents discharge in response to 
passively stretching the muscle, although the Golgi tendon 
organ discharge is much less than that of the spindle. When the 
extrafusal muscle fibers are made to contract by stimulation of 
their « motor neurons, however, the spindle is unloaded and its 
activity decreases, whereas the rate of Golgi tendon organ firing 
increases. (B after Patton, 1965.) 
increasing or decreasing the inhibition of a motor neurons. 
Under these conditions, the Golgi tendon system tends to 
maintain a steady level of force, counteracting effects that 
diminish muscle force (such as fatigue). In short, the mus- 
cle spindle system is a feedback system that monitors and 
maintains muscle length, and the Golgi tendon system is a 
feedback system that monitors and maintains muscle force. 
Like the muscle spindle system, the Golgi tendon organ 
system is subject to a variety of influences: The Ib inhibi- 
tory interneurons also receive synaptic inputs from several 
other sources, including upper motor neurons, cutaneous 
receptors, muscle spindles, and joint receptors, with the lat- 
ter comprising several types of receptors resembling Ruffini's 
and Pacinian corpuscles located in joint capsules (see Chap- 
ter 9). Joint receptors signal hyperextension or hyperflexion 
of the joint, thereby contributing to the protective functions 
mediated by Ib inhibitory interneurons (Figure 16.13). Acting 
in concert, these diverse inputs regulate the responsiveness 
of Ib interneurons to activity arising in Golgi tendon organs.

arrangement prevents muscles from generating excessive 
tension and helps maintain a steady level of tone. 
Flexion Reflex Pathways 
So far, this discussion has focused on reflexes driven by 
sensory receptors located within muscles or tendons. Other 
reflex circuitry mediates the withdrawal of a limb from a 
painful stimulus, such as a pinprick or the heat of a flame. 
Contrary to what might be imagined given the speed with 
which we are able to withdraw from a painful stimulus, this 
flexion reflex involves slowly conducting afferent axons and 
several synaptic links (Figure 16.14). As a result of activity in 
this circuitry, stimulation of nociceptive sensory fibers leads 
to withdrawal of the limb from the source of pain by excita- 
tion of ipsilateral flexor muscles and reciprocal inhibition of 
ipsilateral extensor muscles. Flexion of the stimulated limb 
is also accompanied by an opposite reaction in the con- 
tralateral limb (i.e., the contralateral extensor muscles are 
excited while flexor muscles are inhibited). This crossed ex- 
tension reflex provides postural support during withdrawal 
of the affected limb from the painful stimulus. 
Like the other reflex pathways, local circuit neurons in 
the flexion reflex pathway receive converging inputs from 
several different sources, including other spinal cord in- 
terneurons and upper motor neuron pathways. Although 
the functional significance of this complex pattern of con- 
nectivity is unclear, changes in the character of the reflex, 
following damage to descending pathways, provide some 
insight. Under normal conditions, a noxious stimulus is 
required to evoke the flexion reflex; following damage to 
descending pathways, however, other types of stimulation, 
such as squeezing a limb, can sometimes produce the same 
response. Alternatively, under some conditions, descending 
pathways can suppress the reflex withdrawal from a painful 
stimulus. These observations suggest that the descending 
projections to the spinal cord modulate the responsiveness 
of the local circuitry to a variety of sensory inputs.

_ All animals must coordinate body

cessfully in their environment. All

vertebrates, including mammals, use 
_ local circuits in the spinal cord (cen-

- coordinated movements associated 
_ with locomotion. The cellular basis of 
_ organized locomotor activity, however, 
_ has been most thoroughly studied in an 
invertebrate, the leech, and in a simple 
_ vertebrate, the lamprey. 
Both the leech and the lamprey lack 
peripheral appendages for locomotion 
_ possessed by many vertebrates (limbs, 
flippers, fins, or their equivalent). 
_ Furthermore, their bodies comprise 
repeating muscle segments (as well as 
repeating skeletal elements in the lam- 
prey). Thus, in order to move through 
the water, both animals must coordi- 
nate the movement of each segment. 
They do this by orchestrating a sinusoi- 
_ dal displacement of each body segment 
in sequence, so that the animal is pro- 
pelled forward through the water.

(A) The leech propels itself through the water by sequential

segment. The segmental ganglia in the ventral midline coordi- 
nate swimming, with each ganglion containing a population of 
identified neurons. 
BOX 16B Locomotion in the Leech and the Lamprey 
The leech is particularly well-suited 
for studying the circuit basis of coordi- 
nated movement. The nervous system 
in the leech consists of a series of inter- 
connected segmental ganglia, each with 
motor neurons that innervate the corre- 
sponding segmental muscles (Figure A). 
These segmental ganglia facilitate elec- 
trophysiological studies because there 
is a limited number of neurons in each 
ganglion and each neuron has a distinct 
identity. Neurons can thus be recognized 
and studied from animal to animal and 
their electrical activity correlated with 
the sinusoidal swimming movements. 
A central pattern generator circuit 
coordinates this undulating motion. In 
the leech, the relevant neural circuit is 
an ensemble of sensory neurons, inter- 
neurons, and motor neurons repeated 
in each segmental ganglion that con- 
trols the local sequence of contraction 
and relaxation in each segment of the 
body wall musculature (Figure B). The 
sensory neurons detect the stretch- 
ing and contraction of the body wall

associated with the sequential swim- 
ming movements. Dorsal and ventral 
motor neurons in the circuit provide 
innervation to dorsal and ventral longi- 
tudinal muscles, whose phasic contrac- 
tions propel the leech forward. Sensory 
information and motor neuron signals 
are coordinated by interneurons that 
fire rhythmically, setting up phasic pat- 
terns of activity in the dorsal and ven- 
tral cells that lead to sinusoidal move- 
ment. The intrinsic swimming rhythm 
is established by a variety of membrane 
conductances that mediate periodic 
bursts of suprathreshold action poten- 
tials followed by well-defined periods of 
hyperpolarization. 
The lamprey, one of the simplest 
vertebrates, is distinguished 
by its clear- 
ly segmented musculature and by its 
lack of bilateral fins or other appendag- 
es. In order to move through the water, 
the lamprey contracts and relaxes each 
muscle segment in sequence (Figure C), 
which produces a sinusoidal motion, 
much like that of the leech. Again, a 
central pattern generator coordinates 
this sinusoidal movement. 
Unlike the leech with its segmental 
ganglia, the lamprey has a continuous

segments. The lamprey spinal cord is 
simpler than that of other vertebrates, 
and several classes of identified neu- 
_ 
rons occupy stereotyped positions. This 
orderly arrangement again facilitates 
the identification and analysis of neu- 
rons that constitute the central pattern 
generator circuit. 
In the lamprey spinal cord, the intrin- 
sic firing pattern of a set of interconnect- 
ed sensory neurons, interneurons and 
motor neurons, establishes the pattern 
of undulating muscle contractions that 
underlie swimming (Figure D). The pat- 
terns of connectivity between neurons, 
the neurotransmitters used by each class 
of cell, and the physiological properties 
of the elements in the lamprey pattern 
generator, are now known. One set of 
interneurons—known as excitatory pre- 
motor interneurons (neurons labeled E 
in Figure D)— release glutamate as their 
neurotransmitter and thereby excite one

Spinal Cord Circuitry and Locomotion 
The contribution of local circuitry to motor control is not, of 
course, limited to reflexive responses to sensory inputs. Stud- 
ies of rhythmic movements, such as locomotion and swim- 
ming in animal models (Box 16B), have demonstrated that 
another, as well as nearby inhibitory 
interneurons. A local pool of these excit- 
atory premotor interneurons provides 
the burst generating kernel for segmen- 
tal motor output. One class of inhibitory 
interneurons (neurons labeled I in Figure 
_ 
D) makes reciprocal connections across 
the midline that coordinate the pattern- 
generating circuitry on each side of the 
spinal cord. This circuitry in the lamprey 
thus provides a basis for understanding 
the circuits that control locomotion in 
more complex vertebrates. 
These observations on pattern-gen- 
erating circuits for locomotion in rela- 
_ 
tively simple animals have stimulated 
parallel studies of terrestrial mammals" 
in which central pattern generators in 
the spinal cord also coordinate locomo- 
tion. Although different in detail, ter- 
restrial locomotion ultimately relies on 
sequential movements similar to those 
that propel the leech and the lamprey 
through aquatic environments, as well 
as intrinsic physiological properties 
of spinal cord neurons that establish 
rhythmicity for coordinated movement.

rhythmic patterns of firing elicit com-

ongoing sensory stimulation. A good

limb during locomotion can be thought of as a cycle con- 
sisting of two phases: a stance phase, during which the limb 
is extended and placed in contact with the ground to propel 
the animal forward; and a swing phase, during which the 
limb is flexed to leave the ground and then brought forward 
to begin the next stance phase (Figure 16.15A). Increases 
in the speed of locomotion result from decreases in the 
amount of time it takes to complete a cycle, and most of 
the reduction in the cycle time is due to shortening of the 
stance phase; the swing phase remains relatively constant 
over a wide range of locomotor speeds. 
In quadrupeds, changes in locomotor speed are accom- 
panied by changes in the sequence of limb movements. At 
low speeds, for example, there is a back-to-front progres- 
sion of leg movements, first on one side and then on the

other. As the speed increases to a trot, the movements of 
the right forelimb and left hindlimb are synchronized (as 
are the movements of the left forelimb and right hindlimb). 
At the highest speeds (a gallop), the movements of the two 
front legs are synchronized, as are the movements of the 
two hindlimbs (Figure 16.15B). 
Given the precise timing of the movements of individual 
limbs and the necessity of coordinating these movements, 
it is natural to assume that locomotion is accomplished by 
higher centers that organize the spatial and temporal activ- 
ity patterns of the individual limbs. Indeed, activation of 
centers in the brainstem, such as the mesencephalic loco- 
motor region (see Chapter 17), can trigger locomotion 
and change the speed of the movement by changing their 
amount of input to the spinal cord. However, following

Patterned activity in the motor 
neurons and interneurons of the gan- 
glion begins only if the appropriate 
neuromodulatory input is provided by 
_piocarpine 
sensory axons that originate in other 
ganglia. Depending upon the activity of 
the sensory axons, neuronal ensembles 
in the STG produce one of several 
characteristic rhythmic firing patterns. 
Once activated, however, the intrinsic 
membrane properties of identified cells 
within the ensemble sustain the rhyth- 
micity of the circuit in the absence of 
further sensory input. 
Another key fact that has emerged 
_ from this work is that the same neurons 
can participate in different programmed

transection of the spinal cord at the thoracic level, a cat's 
hindlimbs will still make coordinated locomotor movements 
if the animal is supported and placed on a moving tread- 
mill (Figure 16.15C). Under these conditions, the speed of 
locomotor movements is determined by the speed of the 
treadmill, suggesting that the movement is nothing more 
than a reflexive response to stretching the limb muscles. 
This possibility is ruled out, however, by experiments in 
which the dorsal roots are also sectioned. In this condition, 
locomotion can be induced by the activation of local circuits 
triggered by the act of transecting the spinal cord, or by 
the intravenous injection of L-DOPA (a dopamine precur- 
sor), which may serve to release neurotransmitter from the 
axon terminals of the now-transected upper motor neuron 
pathways. Although the speed of walking is slowed and the 
movements are less coordinated than under normal condi- 
tions, appropriate locomotor movements are still observed. 
These and other observations in experimental animals 
show that the rhythmic patterns of limb movement dur- 
ing locomotion are not dependent on sensory input, nor 
are they dependent on input from descending projections

from higher centers. Rather, each limb appears to have its 
own central pattern generator responsible for the alternat- 
ing flexion and extension of the limb during locomotion 
(see Box 16C). Under normal conditions, the central pat- 
tern generators for the limbs are variably coupled to each 
other by additional local circuits in order to achieve the 
different sequences of movements that occur at different 
speeds. 
Although some locomotor movements can also be elic- 
ited in humans following damage to descending pathways, 
these are considerably less effective than the movements 
seen in the cat. The reduced ability of the transected spinal 
cord to mediate rhythmic stepping movements in humans 
presumably reflects an increased dependence of local cir- 
cuitry on upper motor neuron pathways. Perhaps bipedal 
locomotion carries with it requirements for postural control 
ereater than can be accommodated by spinal cord circuitry 
alone. Whatever the explanation, the basic oscillatory circuits 
that control such rhythmic behaviors as flying, walking, and 
swimming in many animals also play an important part in 
human locomotion.

The Lower Motor Neuron Syndrome

In clinical neurology, this constellation of problems must 
be distinguished from the "upper motor neuron syndrome" 
that results from damage to the descending upper motor 
neuron pathways. (See Chapter 17 for a discussion of the 
signs and symptoms associated with damage to upper mo- 
tor neurons.) 
Damage to lower motor neuron cell bodies, or their pe- 
ripheral axons, results in paralysis (loss of movement) or pa- 
resis (weakness) of the affected muscles, depending on the 
extent of the damage. In addition to paralysis and/or paresis, 
the lower motor neuron syndrome irtcludes a loss of reflexes 
(areflexia) due to interruption of the efferent (motor) limb of 
the sensory motor reflex arcs. Damage to lower motor neu- 
rons also entails a loss of muscle tone, since tone is depen- 
dent in part on the monosynaptic reflex arc that links the 
muscle spindles to the lower motor neurons (see Box 17E). 
A somewhat later effect is atrophy of the affected muscles 
due to denervation and disuse. The muscles involved may 
also exhibit fibrillations and fasciculations, which are spon- 
taneous twitches characteristic of single denervated muscle 
fibers or motor units, respectively. These phenomena arise 
from changes in the excitability of denervated muscle fibers

BOX 16D Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a 
neurodegenerative disease that affects 
an estimated 0.05% of the population in 
the United States. It is also called Lou 
Gehrig's disease, after the New York 
_ Yankees baseball player who died of the 
_ disorder in 1941. ALS is characterized 
_ by the slow but inexorable degeneration 
_ of a motor neurons in the ventral horn 
_ of the spinal cord and brainstem (lower 
- motor neurons) and of neurons in the 
_ motor cortex (upper motor neurons). 
_ Affected individuals show progressive 
weakness due to upper and/or lower 
_ motor neuron involvement, wasting of 
_ 
skeletal muscles due to lower motor 
neuron involvement, and usually die 
within 5 years of onset. Sadly, these 
patients are condemned to watch their 
own demise, since the intellect remains 
intact. No available therapy effectively 
prevents the progression of this disease. 
Approximately 10% of ALS cases 
are familial, and several distinct famil- 
ial forms have been identified. An 
autosomal dominant form of familial 
ALS (FALS) is caused by mutations 
of the gene that encodes the cytosolic 
antioxidant enzyme copper/zinc super- 
oxide dismutase (SOD1). Mutations 
of SOD1 account for roughly 20% of 
families with FALS. A rare, autoso- 
mal recessive, juvenile-onset form is 
caused by mutations in a protein called 
alsin, a putative GTPase regulator. 
Another rare type of FALS consists 
of a slowly progressive, autosomal 
dominant, lower motor neuron disease 
without sensory symptoms, with onset 
in early adulthood; this form is caused 
by mutations of the protein dynactin, 
which binds to microtubules. 
How these mutant genes lead to the 
phenotype of motor neuron disease is 
uncertain. Defects of axonal transport 
have long been hypothesized to cause 
ALS, perhaps because both upper and 
lower motor neurons give rise to some 
of the longest axonal projections in the 
nervous system and may be at greatest 
risk for injury secondary to impair- 
ments of intrinsic axonal structure and/ 
or transport mechanisms. Evidence for 
this cause is that transgenic mice with 
mutant SOD1 exhibit defects in slow 
axonal transport early in the course of 
the disease, and that mutant dynac- 
tin may modify fast axonal transport 
along microtubules. However, whether 
defective axonal transport is the cellu- 
lar mechanism by which these mutant 
proteins lead to motor neuron disease 
remains to be clearly established. 
Recent studies have explored a vari- 
ety of other pathogenic factors that may 
play a role in the majority of ALS cases, 
which are sporadic (i.e., non-familial). 
Among the plausible mechanisms are 
glutamate excitotoxicity (see Box 6C), 
the activity of reactive oxygen species, 
the induction of apoptotic pathways, 
pro-inflammatory interactions between 
neurons and microglia, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and deregulation of cal- 
cium homeostasis. Given that motor 
neurons are exceptionally vulnerable 
to disruption of mitochondrial function 
and that they tend to be weak in their 
capacity to buffer intracellular calcium, 
these last two factors are likely to 
contribute to the selective vulnerability 
of motor neurons in ALS. 
Despite these uncertainties and the 
growing list of candidate mechanisms 
of neurodegeneration in sporadic cases 
of ALS, demonstration that specific 
mutations can cause familial ALS has 
given scientists valuable clues about the 
molecular pathogenesis of at least some 
forms of this tragic disorder.

Summary 
Four distinct but highly interactive motor subsystems— 
local circuits in the spinal cord and brainstem, descending 
upper motor neuron pathways that control these circuits, 
the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum—all make essential 
contributions to motor control. Alpha motor neurons in the 
spinal cord and in the cranial nerve nuclei of the brainstem 
directly link the nervous system and muscles, with each 
motor neuron and its associated muscle fibers constituting 
a functional entity called the motor unit. Motor units vary in 
size, amount of tension produced, speed of contraction, and 
degree of fatigability. Graded increases in muscle tension 
are mediated by both the orderly recruitment of different 
types of motor units and an increase in lower motor neuron 
firing frequency. 
Local circuitry involving sensory inputs, local circuit neu- 
rons, and a and y motor neurons are especially important in

the reflexive control of muscle activity. The stretch reflex is a 
monosynaptic circuit with connections between sensory fi- 
bers arising from muscle spindles and the a motor neurons 
that innervate the same, or synergistic, muscles. Gamma 
motor neurons regulate the gain of the stretch reflex by ad- 
justing the level of tension in the intrafusal muscle fibers of 
the muscle spindle. This mechanism sets the baseline level 
of activity in a motor neurons and helps to regulate muscle 
length and tone. Other reflex circuits provide feedback con- 
trol of muscle tension and mediate essential functions, such 
as the rapid withdrawal of limbs from painful stimuli. 
Much of the spatial coordination and timing of muscle 
activation required for complex rhythmic movements such 
as locomotion are provided by specialized local circuits 
called central pattern generators. Because of their essential 
role in all of these circuits, damage to lower motor neu- 
rons results in paralysis of the associated muscle and other 
changes, including loss of reflex activity, loss of muscle 
tone, and eventual muscle atrophy.

Overview 
THE AXONS OF UPPER MOTOR NEURONS descend from higher centers to influ- 
ence the local circuits in the brainstem and spinal cord. These local circuits organize 
movements by coordinating the activity of the lower motor neurons described in the 
previous chapter. The sources of these upper motor neuron pathways include several 
brainstem centers and a number of cortical areas in the frontal lobe. The motor con- 
trol centers in the brainstem are especially important in postural control, orientation 
toward sensory stimuli, locomotion, and orofacial behavior, with each center having a 
distinct influence. The mesencephalic locomotor area controls locomotion. Two other 
centers, the vestibular nuclear complex and the reticular formation, have widespread 
effects on body posture and position. The reticular formation also contributes to a 
variety of somatic and visceral motor circuits that govern the expression of autonomic 
and stereotyped somatic motor behavior. Also in the brainstem, the superior collicu- 
lus contains upper motor neurons that initiate orienting movements of the head and 
eyes. The primary motor cortex and a mosaic of "premotor" areas in the frontal lobe, 
in contrast, are responsible for the planning and precise control of complex sequences 
of voluntary movements, as well as mediating the somatic expression of emotional 
states. Most upper motor neurons, regardless of their source, influence the genera- 
tion of movements by modulating the activity of the local circuits in the brainstem 
and spinal cord. Upper motor neurons in the cortex also control movement indirectly, 
via pathways that project to motor control centers in the brainstem, which, in turn, 
project to the local organizing circuits in the brainstem and spinal cord. These indirect 
pathways adjust the body's posture during cortically initiated voluntary movements. 
Organization of Descending Motor Control 
The arrangement of the lower motor neurons and local circuit neurons within the 
spinal cord—the ultimate targets of the upper motor neurons—provides insight into 
the functions of different sets of upper motor neurons. As described in Chapter 16, 
lower motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord are distributed in a so- 
matotopic fashion: the most medial part of the ventral horn contains lower motor 
neuron pools that innervate axial muscles or proximal muscles of the limbs, whereas

the more lateral parts contain lower motor neurons that 
innervate the distal muscles of the limbs (Figure 17.1). The 
local circuit neurons, which lie primarily in the intermedi- 
ate zone of the spinal cord and supply much of the direct 
input to the lower motor neurons, are also topographically 
arranged. Thus, the medial region of the intermediate zone 
of the spinal cord gray matter contains the local circuit neu- 
rons that synapse with lower motor neurons in the medial 
part of the ventral horn, whereas the lateral regions of the 
intermediate zone contain local neurons that synapse pri- 
marily with lower motor neurons in the lateral ventral horn. 
As emphasized in Chapter 16, the somatotopic organiza- 
tion of the ventral horn provides an important framework 
for understanding the control of the body's musculature

Differences in the way upper motor neuron pathways 
from the cortex and brainstem terminate in the spinal cord 
conform to the functional distinctions between the local 
circuits that organize the activity of axial and distal muscle 
eroups. Thus, most upper motor neurons that project to the 
medial part of the ventral horn also project to the medial 
region of the intermediate zone. The axons of these upper 
motor neurons course through the anterior-medial white 
matter of the spinal cord and give rise to collateral branches 
that terminate over many spinal cord segments among me- 
dial cell groups on both sides of the spinal cord. The sources 
of these projections are located primarily in the brainstem 
and, as their terminal zones in the medial spinal cord gray 
matter suggest, they are concerned primarily with posture, 
balance, and orienting mechanisms (see Figure 17.1B). In 
contrast, the large majority of axons that project from the 
motor cortex to the spinal cord course through the lateral 
white matter of the spinal cord and terminate in lateral parts 
of the ventral horn, with terminal fields that are restricted to 
only a few spinal cord segments. The major component of 
this corticospinal pathway is concerned with the voluntary 
expression of precise, skilled movements involving more 
distal parts of the limbs.

of the spinal cord. For simplicity, only one side

377 
The Corticospinal and 
Corticobulbar Tracts 
The upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex reside in 
several adjacent and highly interconnected areas in the 
posterior frontal lobe, which together mediate the plan- 
ning and initiation of complex temporal sequences of vol- 
untary movements. These cortical areas all receive regula- 
tory input from the basal ganglia and cerebellum via relays 
in the ventrolateral thalamus (see Chapters 18 and 19), as 
well as inputs from sensory regions of the parietal lobe (see 
Chapter 9). Although the label "motor cortex" is sometimes 
used to refer to these frontal areas collectively, the term is 
more commonly restricted to the primary motor cortex 
located in the precentral gyrus and the paracentral lobule 
(Figure 17.2; see the Appendix and Plates 1-4 of the Atlas 
for illustrations of the gyral formations). The primary motor 
cortex can be distinguished from a complex mosaic of adja- 
cent "premotor" areas both cytoarchitectonically (it is area 
4 in Brodmann's nomenclature; see Figure 26.2) and by the 
low intensity of current necessary to elicit movements by 
electrical stimulation in this region. The low threshold for 
eliciting movements is an indicator of a relatively large and

The pyramidal cells of cortical layer 5 are the upper mo- 
tor neurons of the primary motor cortex. Among these 
neurons are the conspicuous Betz cells, which are the larg- 
est neurons (by soma size) in the human central nervous 
system (Figure 17.3). Although it is often assumed that Betz 
cells are the principal upper motor neurons of the motor 
cortex, there are far too few of them to account for the di- 
rect projection from the motor cortex to the brainstem and 
spinal cord; indeed, in the human central nervous system, 
they account for no more than 5% of the projection to the 
spinal cord. Despite their small numbers, Betz cells are 
likely to play an important role in the activation of lower 
motor neurons that control muscle activities in the distal 
extremities. The remaining upper motor neurons are non-

to the medullary pyramids. As they course 
through the brainstem, corticobulbar axons 
(gold) give rise to collaterals that innervate 
brainstem motor nuclei (only three collaterals

tor neuron pathway that innervate cranial nerve nuclei, the 
reticular formation, and the red nucleus (that is, the corti- 
cobulbar tract) leave the pathway at the appropriate levels 
of the brainstem (see Figure 17.4). There is also a massive 
corticobulbar project that terminates among nuclei in the 
base of the pons; this projection is often called the cortico-

BOX 17A Patterns of Facial Weakness and Their Importance for Localizing 
Neurological Injury 
The signs and symptoms pertinent to 
the cranial nerves and their nuclei are 
of special importance to clinicians seek- 
ing to pinpoint the neurological lesions 
that produce motor deficits. An espe- 
cially instructive example is provided 
by the muscles of facial expression. It 
has long been recognized that the dis- 
tribution of facial weakness provides 
important localizing clues indicating 
whether the underlying injury involves 
_ lower motor neurons in the facial motor 
- nucleus (and/or their axons in the facial 
_ nerve) or the inputs that govern these 
_ neurons, which arise from upper motor 
_ neurons in the cerebral cortex. Damage 
_ to the facial motor nucleus or its nerve 
_ affects all the muscles of facial expres- 
_ 
sion on the side of the lesion (lesion 
_ Cin the figure); this is expected, given 
the intimate anatomical and functional 
_ linkage between lower motor neu- 
rons and skeletal muscles. A pattern 
of impairment that is more difficult to 
explain accompanies unilateral injury 
_ 
to the motor areas in the lateral frontal 
_ lobe (primary motor and premotor cor- 
tex), as occurs with strokes that involve 
the middle cerebral artery (lesion A in 
the figure). Most patients with such 
injuries have difficulty controlling the 
contralateral muscles around the mouth 
but retain the ability to symmetrically 
raise their eyebrows, wrinkle their fore- 
head, and squint. 
Until recently, it was assumed that 
this pattern of inferior facial paresis 
with superior facial sparing could be 
_ attributed to (presumed) bilateral pro- 
jections from the face representation 
_ 
in the primary motor cortex to the facial 
- motor nucleus; in this conception, the 
intact ipsilateral corticobulbar projec- 
tions were considered sufficient to 
motivate the contractions of the superi- 
- 
or muscles of the face. However, recent 
tract-tracing studies in non-human 
_ primates have suggested a different 
explanation. These studies demonstrate 
two important facts that clarify the rela- 
- 
tions among the face representations 
in the cerebral cortex and the facial 
- motor nucleus. First, the corticobulbar 
projections of the primary motor cortex 
are directed predominantly toward the 
lateral cell columns in the contralateral 
facial motor nucleus, which control the 
movements of the perioral musculature. 
Thus, the more dorsal cell columns in 
the facial motor nucleus that innervate 
superior facial muscles do not receive 
significant input from the primary 
motor cortex. Second, these dorsal cell 
columns are governed by premotor 
areas in the anterior cingulate gyrus, a 
cortical region that is associated with 
emotional processing (see Chapter 29). 
Therefore, strokes involving the middle 
cerebral artery spare the superior aspect 
of the face because the relevant upper 
motor neurons are in the cingulate 
gyrus, which is supplied by the anterior 
cerebral artery. 
These studies have resolved an 
additional puzzle. Strokes involving the 
anterior cerebral artery or subcortical 
lesions that interrupt the corticobul- 
bar projection (lesion B in the figure)

projections through the corticobulbar 
pathway that bifurcate and innervate 
dorsal facial motor cell columns on 
both sides of the brainstem. Thus, the 
superior muscles of facial expression 
__are controlled 
by symmetrical inputs 
which constitute the ventral (anterior) corticospinal tract, 
terminate either ipsilaterally or bilaterally (with collateral 
branches crossing the midline via the ventral white commis- 
sure of the spinal cord). The ventral corticospinal pathway 
arises primarily from dorsal and medial regions of the motor 
cortex that serve axial and proximal limb muscles, the same 
divisions of the motor cortex that give rise to projections to 
the reticular formation (see below). 
The lateral corticospinal tract forms a direct pathway 
from the cortex to the spinal cord and terminates primarily 
in the lateral portions of the ventral horn and intermedi- 
ate gray matter, with some axons (including those derived 
from Betz cells) synapsing directly on a motor neurons that 
govern the distal extremities (see Figures 17.1 and 17.4). 
However, this privileged synaptic contact on lower motor 
neurons is restricted to a subset of a motor neurons that 
supply the muscles of the forearm and hand; most axons 
of the lateral corticospinal tract terminate among pools of 
local circuit neurons that coordinate the activities of the 
lower motor neurons in the lateral cell columns of the ven- 
tral horn. This terminal distribution implies an important 
role for the lateral corticospinal tract in the control of the 
hands. Although selective damage to this pathway in hu- 
mans is rarely seen, evidence from experimental studies in 
non-human primates indicates that direct projections from 
the motor cortex to the spinal cord are essential for the 
performance of discrete finger movements. This evidence 
helps explain the limited recovery in humans after damage 
to the motor cortex or some component of this pathway. 
Immediately after such an injury, such patients are typically 
paralyzed on the affected side. With time, however, some 
ability to perform voluntary movements reappears. These 
movements, which are presumably mediated by residual 
corticospinal inputs and by motor centers in the brainstem, 
are crude for the most part, and the ability to perform frac- 
tionated finger movements, such as those required for 
writing, typing, playing a musical instrument, or buttoning 
clothes, typically remains impaired. 
Finally, some components of the corticobulbar and cor- 
ticospinal projections do not participate directly in upper 
areas (see Figure 17.9) send descending

motor control of lower motor neurons. These components 
are derived from layer 5 neurons in somatic sensory regions 
of the anterior parietal lobe and terminate among local cir- 
cuit neurons near the sensory trigeminal nuclei and dorsal 
column nuclei of the brainstem, and in the dorsal horn of 
the spinal cord. They are likely involved in modulating the 
transmission of proprioceptive signals and other mechano- 
sensory inputs relevant to monitoring body movements. In- 
terestingly, the corticospinal projection to the ventral horn 
is largest in vertebrates that have the most complex reper- 
toire of fractionated movements with their hands or fore- 
paws. In animals with little ability to execute skilled move- 
ments with their forepaws, the corticospinal projection is 
predominantly directed toward the dorsal horn, where it 
modulates sensory input to the brain and spinal cord. 
Functional Organization of the 
Primary Motor Cortex 
Clinical observations and experimental work dating back 
100 years or more provide a foundation for understanding 
the functional organization of the motor cortex. By the end 
of the nineteenth century, experimental work in animals by 
the German physiologists G. Theodor Fritsch and Eduard 
Hitzig had shown that electrical stimulation of the motor 
cortex elicits contractions of muscles on the contralateral 
side of the body. Around the same time, the British neu- 
rologist John Hughlings Jackson surmised that the motor 
cortex contains a complete spatial representation, or map, 
of the body's musculature. Jackson reached this conclusion 
from his observation that the abnormal movements dur- 
ing some types of epileptic seizures "march" systematically 
from one part of the body to another. For instance, partial 
motor seizures may begin with abnormal movements of a 
finger, then involve the entire hand, and progressively affect 
the forearm, the arm, the shoulder, and, finally, the face. 
This early evidence for motor maps in the cortex was 
confirmed shortly after the turn of the nineteenth century 
when Charles Sherrington published his classic maps of the 
organization of the motor cortex in great apes. These maps

were created using focal electrical stimulation applied to the 
surface of the cortex. During the 1930s, one of Sherrington's 
students, the renowned neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, ex- 
tended this work by demonstrating that the human motor 
cortex also contains a spatial map of the contralateral body. 
By correlating the location of muscle contractions with the 
site of electrical stimulation on the surface of the motor 
cortex (the same method used by Sherrington), Penfield 
mapped the motor representation in the precentral gyrus 
in over 400 neurosurgical patients (Figure 17.5). He found 
that this motor map shows the same general disproportions 
observed in the somatic sensory maps in the postcentral 
gyrus (see Chapter 9). Thus, the musculature used in tasks 
requiring fine motor control (such as movements of the face 
and hands) is represented by a greater area of motor cortex 
than is the musculature requiring less precise motor control 
(such as that of the trunk). The behavioral implications of 
cortical motor maps are considered in Boxes 17B and 17C. 
The introduction in the 1960s of intracortical micro- 
stimulation (a more refined method of cortical activation) 
allowed a more detailed understanding of motor maps.

Furthermore, cortical microstimu- 
lation experiments have shown that 
contraction of a single muscle can be 
evoked by stimulation over a wide 
region of the motor cortex (about 2-3 
mm in macaque monkeys) in a com- 
plex, mosaic fashion. It seems likely 
that horizontal connections within the 
motor cortex and local circuits in the 
spinal cord create ensembles of neurons 
that coordinate the pattern of firing in

_ ultimately generate a given movement. 
Thus, while the somatotopic maps

suggest that the topographic represen- 
tations of movement in the motor cor- 
_ tex are organized around ethologically 
_ relevant categories of motor behavior. 
For example, microstimulation of 
sites in the arm region of the primary 
_ motor cortex often invoked movements 
of the arm that brought the mon-

the animal might visually inspect and

cates cortex folded into the anterior bank of the central sulcus. (After Graziano et al., 2005.) 
These observations suggests that the 
posterior regions of the motor cortex, 
including the primary motor cortex, 
are most concerned with manual and 
oral behaviors that occur in central, 
personal space. Just anterior to this 
cortical region (in the premotor cortex) 
are sites that, when stimulated, elicit 
reaching motions and other outward 
arm movements directed away from the 
body. Other anterior sites may evoke 
coordinated, defensive postures as 
well, perhaps reflecting the integration 
of threatening sensory signals derived 
from extrapersonal space.New studies 
of the mirror neuron system raise the 
intriguing possibility that what is actu- 
ally represented in the motor cortex is 
the intention of movement, rather than 
movement per se. Obviously, these are 
exciting times for investigators study- 
ing the cortical governance of move- 
ment. Unraveling the details of what is 
represented in motor maps still holds 
the key to understanding how patterns 
of activity in the primate motor cortex 
generate the rich repertoire of volitional 
movement.

tion of several muscles (and the simultaneous suppression 
of others), suggesting that organized movements rather 
than individual muscles are represented in the map (see 
Box 17B). Furthermore, within major subdivisions of the 
map (e.g., forearm or face regions), a particular movement 
could be elicited by stimulation of widely separated sites, 
supporting the argument that neurons in nearby regions 
are linked by local circuits in the cortex and spinal cord to 
organize specific movements. This interpretation has been 
supported by the observation that the regions responsible 
for initiating different movements overlap substantially. 
The conclusion that movements rather than muscles are 
encoded in the cortex also applies to the motor areas of 
the frontal cortex that control eye movements, where focal 
stimulation elicits binocular shifts in the direction of gaze

given motor neuron. (After Porter and Lemon, 1993.) 
At about the same time that these studies were under- 
taken, Ed Evarts and his colleagues at the National Insti- 
tutes of Health were pioneering a technique in which im- 
planted microelectrodes were used to record the electrical 
activity of individual motor neurons in awake, behaving 
monkeys. The monkeys were trained to perform a variety of 
motor tasks, thus providing a means of correlating neuronal 
activity with voluntary movements. Evarts and his group 
found that the force generated by contracting muscles 
changed as a function of the firing rate of upper motor neu- 
rons. Moreover, the firing rates of the active neurons often 
changed prior to movements involving very small forces. 
Evarts therefore proposed that the primary motor cortex 
contributes to the initial phase of recruitment of lower mo- 
tor neurons involved in the generation of finely controlled 
movements. Additional experiments showed that the ac- 
tivity of primary motor neurons is correlated not only with 
the magnitude, but also with the direction of the force pro- 
duced by muscles. Thus, some neurons show progressively 
less activity as the vector of the movement deviates from 
the neuron's "preferred direction." 
A further advance was made in the mid 1970s with the 
introduction of spike-triggered averaging (Figure 17.6). By cor- 
relating the timing of the cortical neuron's discharges with 
the onset times of the contractions generated by the various 
muscles used in a movement, this method provides a way 
of measuring the influence of a single cortical motor neuron 
on a population of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord.

CHAPTER 17 
_ Are special sensory motor talents, such 
as the exceptional speed and coordi- 
_ nation displayed by talented athletes, 
- ballet dancers, or concert musicians, 
_ visible in the structure of the nervous 
_ system? The widespread use of non- 
_ invasive brain imaging techniques 
_ (see Box 1B) has generated a spate of 
_ studies that have tried to answer this 
_ and related questions. Most of these 
_ studies have sought to link particular 
_ sensory-motor skills to the amount of 
_ brain space devoted to such talents. 
For example, a study of professional 
violinists, cellists, and classical guitar- 
_ ists purported to show that representa- 
_ tions of the "fingering" digits of the 
left hand in the right primary somatic 
sensory cortex are larger than the cor- 
responding representations in the 
opposite hemisphere. 
Although such studies in humans 
remain controversial (the techniques 
are only semi-quantitative), the idea 
that greater motor talents (or any other 
ability) will be reflected in a greater 
amount of brain space devoted to that 
task makes good sense. In particular, 
comparisons across species show that 
special talents are invariably based on 
commensurately sophisticated brain 
circuitry, which means more neurons, 
more synaptic contacts between neu- 
rons, and more supporting glial cells— 
all of which occupy more space within 
the brain. The size and proportion of 
bodily representations in the primary 
somatic sensory and motor cortices of 
various animals reflects species-specific 
nuances of mechanosensory discrimi- 
nation and motor control. Thus, the 
representations of the paws are dispro- 
portionately large in the sensorimotor 
cortex of raccoons; rats and mice devote 
a great deal of cortical space to rep- 
resentations of their prominent facial 
whiskers; and a large fraction of the 
sensorimotor cortex of the star-nosed 
mole is given over to representing the 
elaborate nasal appendages that pro- 
vide critical mechanosensory informa- 
tion for this burrowing species. The 
link between behavioral competence 
and the allocation of space is equally 
apparent in animals in which a particu- 
lar ability has diminished, or has never 
developed fully, during the course of 
evolution. Nevertheless, it remains 
uncertain how—or if—this principle 
applies to variations in behavior among 
members of the same species, including 
humans. 
One promising domain of human 
behavior that has been a fruitful para- 
digm for exploring the relationship 
between skill and brain structure is 
handedness. Investigators have rea- 
soned that size asymmetry might exist 
in the somatic sensory and motor sys- 
tems simply because 90% of humans 
prefer to use the right hand when they 
perform challenging manual tasks. 
Several in vivo and post mortem stud- 
ies have examined the morphometry 
of the central sulcus in the two hemi- 
spheres and, despite some conflicting 
results, there is a degree of consensus 
favoring a deeper central sulcus on the 
left side of right-handers. This asym- 
metry in gyral size could reflect an 
underlying difference in the extent of 
the relevant Brodmann/'s areas in the 
two hemispheres (areas 3, 1, and 2 in 
the postcentral gyrus; areas 6 and 4 in 
the precentral gyrus), but initial cyto- 
architectonic studies have not shown 
a corresponding asymmetry in the 
overall size of areas 3 and 4. However, 
microanatomical studies have shown 
that more tissue volume is occupied by 
cellular processes and synapses in area 
4 of the left hemisphere in comparison 
with the right, and that the precentral 
portion of the corticospinal/corticobul= 
bar tract is larger on the left side than 
on the right. Although the neurobio- 
logical basis of human handedness 
remains unresolved, such studies sug- 
gest it may be possible to understand 
the relation between skilled behavior 
and cortical space if the relevant 
brain structures are identified and 
their functional connections assessed 
histologically. 
It seems likely that individual sen- 
sory motor talents among humans 
BOX 17C Sensory Motor Talents and Cortical Space 
will be reflected in the allocation of an 
appreciably different amount of space 
to those behaviors, but this issue is just 
beginning to be explored with quantita- 
tive methods.

UPPER MOTOR NEURON CONTROL OF THE BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD 
385 
Recording such activity from different muscles as monkeys 
performed wrist flexion or extension demonstrated that the 
activity of a number of different muscles is directly facilitated 
by the discharges of a given upper motor neuron. This pe- 
ripheral muscle group is referred to as the muscle field of the 
upper motor neuron. On average, the size of the muscle field 
in the wrist region is 2-3 muscles per upper motor neuron. 
These observations, which confirmed that single upper mo- 
tor neurons contact several lower motor neuron pools, are 
consistent with the general conclusion that the activity of 
the upper motor neurons in the cortex controls movements, 
rather than individual muscles (see Box 17B). 
For the several reasons discussed above, the motor map 
in the precentral gyrus is much less precise than the so- 
matotopic map in the postcentral gyrus, where the receptive 
fields of adjacent cortical neurons overlap in a smooth and 
continuous progression across the surface of the primary so- 
matic sensory cortex. Indeed, it is problematic to represent 
the motor map in the form of a homunculus cartoon that 
would be analogous to the somatic sensory homunculus in 
the postcentral gyrus (see Figure 9.11), since the representa- 
tion of muscle movement is not organized at the level of in- 
dividual muscles or body parts, and the distribution of muscle 
fields among neighboring cortical neurons is neither spatially 
continuous or temporally fixed. However, this apparent im- 
precision in the motor map does not indicate a degenerate 
representation of the body's musculature in the motor cortex. 
Rather, it suggests a dynamic and flexible means for encod- 
ing higher order movement parameters that entails the co- 
ordinated activation of multiple muscle groups across several 
joints to perform behaviorally useful actions. 
This principle of upper motor neural control has been 
demonstrated by Michael S. A. Graziano and his colleagues 
at Princeton University, who extended the technique of 
cortical microstimulation in behaving monkeys to a tim- 
escale that more closely corresponds to the duration of 
volitional movements (from hundreds of milliseconds to 
several seconds). When such stimuli are applied to the pre- 
central gyrus, the resulting movements are sequentially dis- 
tributed across multiple joints and are strikingly purposeful 
(Figure 17.7). Examples of motor patterns frequently elicited 
with prolonged microstimulation of the precentral gyrus are 
movements of the hand to the mouth as if to feed, move- 
ments that bring the hand to central space as if to inspect an 
object of interest, and defensive postures as if to protect the 
body from an impending collision. These findings reinforce 
the current view that purposeful movements are mapped in 
the primary motor cortex and that their somatotopic orga- 
nization is best understood in the context of ethologically 
relevant behaviors (see Box 17B and the next section). 
Finally, the commands to perform precise movement 
patterns are encoded in the integrated activity of a large 
population of upper motor neurons. One well-studied par- 
adigm for exploring the nature of this neural code involves 
recording from cortical neurons during visually guided 
reaching movements of the arm and hand. Using this par- 
adiem, the direction of arm movements in monkeys could

Purposeful movements of the contralateral 
arm and hand in a macaque monkey. Prolonged micro- 
stimulation of primary motor cortex sites near the middle of 
the precentral gyrus elicit coordinated movements of the hand 
and mouth (A) or movements of the arm that bring the hand 
toward central space, as if to visually inspect and manipulate a 
held object (B). The starting positions of the contralateral hand 
are indicated by the blue crosses, the elicited movements are 
illustrated with the curved black lines, and the final positions of 
the hand at the end of microstimulation are indicated by the red 
dots. (After Graziano et al., 2005.)

be predicted by calculating a "neuronal population vector" 
derived simultaneously from the discharges of a population 
of upper motor neurons that are "broadly tuned" in the 
sense that each neuron discharges prior to movements in 
many directions (Figure 17.8). These observations showed 
that the discharges of individual upper motor neurons 
cannot specify the direction of an arm movement, simply

ron in the primary motor cortex. (A) A monkey is trained to 
move a joystick in the direction indicated by a light. (B) The activ- 
ity of a single neuron was recorded during arm movements in 
each of eight different directions (0 indicates the time of move- 
ment onset; each short vertical line in this raster plot represents 
an action potential). The activity of the neuron increased before 
movements between 90° and 225° (yellow zone) but decreased 
in anticipation of movements between 45° and 315° (blue zone). 
(C) Plot showing that the neuron's discharge rate was greatest 
before movements in a particular direction, which defines the 
neuron's "preferred direction" in this experimental paradigm. (D) 
The black lines indicate the discharge rates of individual upper 
motor neurons prior to each direction of movement. By combin- 
ing the responses of all the neurons, a "population vector" (red 
arrows) can be derived that represents the movement direction 
encoded by the simultaneous activity of the entire population. 
(After Georgeopoulos et al., 1986.) 
because they are tuned too broadly; rather, each arm move- 
ment must be encoded by the concurrent discharges of a 
large population of such neurons. The fact that the same 
site in the primary motor cortex can encode different tra- 
jectories of motion depending upon the starting position of 
the limb (see Figure 17.7) suggests that multiple parameters 
of movement may be selected by the relevant ensemble of 
upper motor neurons to achieve a behaviorally useful ac- 
tion. Thus, microstimulation experiments utilize exogenous 
electrical currents to engage populations of upper motor 
neurons whose output encodes not simply the trajectory of

387 
The Premotor Cortex 
A complex mosaic of interconnected frontal lobe areas that 
lie rostral to the primary motor cortex also contributes to 
motor functions (see Figure 17.2). This functional division 
of the motor cortex includes Brodmann's areas 6, 8, and 
44/45 on the lateral surface of the frontal lobe and parts of 
areas 23 and 24 on the medial surface of the hemisphere. 
Although the organization of this premotor mosaic is best 
understood in the macaque monkey (Figure 17.9), recent 
functional brain imaging studies in human subjects, as well 
as studies of patients with frontal lobe injuries, suggest that 
a comparable distribution of premotor areas is present in 
humans. Each of the divisions of the premotor cortex re- 
ceives extensive multisensory input from regions of the in- 
ferior and superior parietal lobules, as well as more complex 
signals related to motivation and intention from the rostral 
("prefrontal") divisions of the frontal lobe. The upper motor 
neurons in this premotor cortex influence motor behavior 
both indirectly, through extensive reciprocal connections 
with the primary motor cortex, and directly, via axons that 
project through the corticobulbar and corticospinal path- 
ways to influence local circuit and lower motor neurons of 
the brainstem and spinal cord. 
Indeed, over 30% of the axons in the corticospinal tract 
arise from neurons in the premotor cortex. Thus, past ar- 
guments that the premotor cortex occupies a higher posi- 
tion in a cortical hierarchy of motor control by operating 
through feedforward signals to the primary motor cortex 
are no longer tenable. Rather, a variety of experiments 
indicate that the premotor cortex uses information from 
other cortical regions to select movements appropriate to 
the context of the action (see Chapter 26). The principal 
difference between the premotor cortex and primary mo- 
tor cortex lies in the strength of their connections to lower 
motor neurons, with more upper motor neurons in the pri- 
mary motor cortex making monosynaptic connections to 
a-motor neurons, especially those in the ventral horn of the 
cervical spinal cord that control the distal upper extremities. 
Recent evidence suggests that other differences may reflect 
the mapping of purposeful movements relative to personal 
and extrapersonal space and the nature of the signals that 
lead to the initiation of motor commands (see Box 17B). 
The functions of the premotor cortex may be understood 
in terms of differences between the lateral and medial com- 
ponents of this region. As many as 65% of the neurons in 
the lateral premotor cortex have responses that are linked 
in time to the occurrence of movements; as in the primary 
motor area, many of these cells fire most strongly in asso- 
ciation with movements made in a specific direction. How- 
ever, these neurons are especially important in conditional 
("closed loop") motor tasks. That is, in contrast to the neu- 
rons in the primary motor area, when a monkey is trained

Divisions of the motor cortex in the macaque 
monkey brain. As in humans, the primary motor cortex resides 
in the anterior bank of the central sulcus. Anterior to this region 
is a complex mosaic of premotor areas that extends from the 
frontal operculum on the lateral surface of the frontal lobe to the 
cingulate gyrus on the medial hemispheric surface. The lateral 
premotor and supplementary motor areas are involved in select- 
ing and organizing purposeful movements of the limbs and face; 
the frontal eye fields organize voluntary gaze shifts (see Chapter 
20), and the cingulate motor areas are involved in the expression 
of emotional somatic behavior (see Chapter 29). Current evidence 
supports the existence of comparable premotor areas in the 
human motor cortex. (After Geyer et al., 2000.) 
to reach in different directions depending on the nature 
of a visual cue, the appropriately tuned lateral premotor 
neurons begin to fire at the appearance of the cue, well 
before the monkey receives a signal to actually make the 
movement. As the animal learns to associate a new visual 
cue with the movement, appropriately tuned neurons begin 
to increase their rate of discharge in the interval between 
the cue and the onset of the signal to perform the move- 
ment. Rather than directly commanding the initiation of a 
movement, these neurons appear to encode the monkey's 
intention to perform a particular movement; thus, they seem 
to be particularly involved in the selection of movements 
based on external events. 

388 
CHAPTER 17 
One particular division in the ventrolateral 
portion of the premotor cortex has received con- 
siderable attention in recent years, after the dis- 
covery that a subset of its neurons responds not 
just in preparation for the execution of particular 
movements, such as a precision grip to retrieve a 
morsel of food, but also when the same action is 
observed, being performed by another (monkey 
or human). For example, these premotor neurons 
fire action potentials when a monkey observes 
the hand of a human trainer engaging in the 
same or similar action that would activate these 
neurons during self-initiated movements (Figure 
17.10). However, these so-called mirror motor 
neurons respond much less well when the same 
actions are pantomimed without the presence of 
a behavioral goal, such as an object to be grasped. 
Furthermore, they respond during the observa- 
tion of goal-directed behavior even when the fi- 
nal stage of the action is hidden from view—for 
example, the grasping of an object known to the 
monkey to have been placed behind a small bar- 
rier. These findings suggest that the mirror motor 
system is involved in encoding the intentions and 
behaviorally relevant actions of others and may 
participate in an extended network of parietal and 
frontal regions that subserve imitation learning. 
The functions of the mirror motor system are 
FIGURE 17.10 
Mirror motor neuron activity in a 
ventral-anterior sector of the lateral premotor 
cortex. In each panel, the upper graphics illustrate 
the monkey's view of the hand of the trainer placing 
a food morsel on a tray and the monkey's own hand 
extending to retrieve the morsel. The middle graph- 
ics illustrate raster plots that show the firing of the 
neuron relative to the observed and executed move- 
ments (each tick mark indicates an action potential, 
and each row represents one trial). The lower graphs 
are peristimulus response histograms aligned to the 
overlying raster plots. The mirror motor neuron fires 
during the passive observation of a human hand 
placing the morsel of food on the tray (A), as well as 
during the execution of a similar action to retrieve 
the food. (The vertical line in the raster plots indicates 
the time at which the food was placed on the tray; 
1-2 seconds later, the monkey reaches to retrieve the 
morsel.) The same neuron does not respond when 
the food is placed with the aid of pliers (B), but it does 
fire during the monkey's reaching and retrieval move- 
ments when the monkey is allowed to observe its 
reach (B) and when the behavior is executed behind 
a barrier (C). These findings suggest that this division 
of the premotor cortex plays a role in encoding the 
actions of others. (After Rizzolatti et al., 1996.)

UPPER MOTOR NEURON CONTROL OF THE BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD 
389 
among the most actively studied and debated domains of 
motor and cognitive neuroscience, but the full scope of this 
system's contributions to motor control, to motor learning, 
and to complex brain functions such as social communica- 
tion, language, and empathy, remain to be elucidated. 
Further evidence that the lateral premotor area is con- 
cerned with movement selection comes from the effects of 
cortical damage on motor behavior. Lesions in this region 
severely impair the ability of monkeys to perform visually 
cued conditional tasks, even though they can still respond 
to the visual stimulus and can perform the same move- 
ment in a different setting. Similarly, patients with frontal 
lobe damage have difficulty learning to select a particular 
movement to be performed in response to a visual cue, even 
though they understand the instructions and can perform 
the movements. Individuals with lesions in the premotor 
cortex may also have difficulty performing movements in 
response to verbal commands. 
Finally, a rostral division of the lateral premotor cor- 
tex in the human brain, especially in the left hemisphere, 
has evolved to play a special role in organizing vocal tract 
articulators that are involved in the production of speech 
sounds. This region, called Broca's area (which typically 
corresponds to Brodmann's areas 44 and 45), is critical for 
the production of speech and will be considered in detail 
in Chapter 27. The evolution of this premotor division in 
primates and its functional relation to semantic processing 
regions in the parietal and temporal lobe is an area of active 
investigation. 
The medial premotor cortex, like the lateral area, medi- 
ates the selection of movements. However, this region ap- 
pears to be specialized for initiating movements specified 
by internal rather than external cues ("open-loop" condi- 
tions). In contrast to lesions in the lateral premotor area, 
removal of the medial premotor area in a monkey reduces 
the number of self-initiated or "spontaneous" movements 
the animal makes, whereas the ability to execute move- 
ments in response to external cues remains largely intact. 
Imaging studies suggest that this cortical region in humans 
functions in much the same way. For example, functional 
brain imaging studies show that the medial region of the 
premotor cortex is activated when the subjects perform mo- 
tor sequences from memory (i.e., without relying on an ex- 
ternal instruction). In accord with this evidence, single unit 
recordings in monkeys indicate that many neurons in the 
medial premotor cortex begin to discharge 1 or 2 seconds 
before the onset of a self-initiated movement. Among the 
areas of the medial premotor cortex are two divisions that 
will be considered in more detail elsewhere: a frontal eye 
field (see Figure 17.9) involved in directing visual gaze to- 
ward a location of interest (see also Chapter 20); and a set 
of areas in the depths of the cingulate sulcus (see Figure 
17.9 and Box 17A) that plays a role in the expression of 
emotional behavior (see also Chapter 29). 
In summary, both the lateral and medial areas of the pre- 
motor cortex are intimately involved in selecting a specific 
movement or sequence of movements from the repertoire 
of possible behaviorally relevant actions. The functions of 
the areas differ, however, in the relative contributions of 
external and internal cues to the selection process. 
Motor Control Centers in the 
Brainstem: Upper Motor Neurons that 
Maintain Balance, Govern Posture, 
and Orient Gaze 
Several structures in the brainstem contain circuits of upper 
motor neurons whose activities serve to organize a variety 
of somatic movements involving the axial musculature and 
the muscles of the proximal limbs. These movements in- 
clude the maintenance of balance, the regulation of posture, 
and the orientation of visual gaze. They are governed by up- 
per motor neurons in the nuclei of the vestibular complex, 
the reticular formation, and the superior colliculus. Such 
movements are usually necessary to support the expres- 
sion of skilled motor behaviors involving the more distal 
parts of the extremities or, in the case of visual gaze, when 
attention is directed toward a particular sensory stimulus. 
Indeed, the relevant brainstem circuits are competent to 
direct motor behavior without supervision by higher motor 
centers in the cerebral cortex. However, these brainstem 
motor centers usually work in concert with divisions of the 
motor cortex that organize volitional movements, which 
always entail both skilled (voluntary) and supporting (re- 
flexive) motor activities. 
As described in Chapter 14, the vestibular nuclei are 
the major destination of the axons that form the vestibular 
division of the eighth cranial nerve; as such, they receive 
sensory information from the semicircular canals and the 
otolith organs that specifies the position and the angular 
and linear acceleration of the head. Many of the cells in 
the vestibular nuclei that receive this information are up- 
per motor neurons with descending axons that terminate in 
the medial region of the spinal cord gray matter, although 
some extend more laterally to contact the neurons that 
control the proximal muscles of the limbs. The projections 
from the vestibular nuclei that control axial muscles and 
those that influence proximal limb muscles originate from 
different cells and take somewhat different routes to the 
spinal cord (Figure 17.11A). Neurons in the medial ves- 
tibular nucleus give rise to a medial vestibulospinal tract 
that terminates bilaterally in the medial ventral horn of the 
cervical cord. There, the medial vestibulospinal tract regu- 
lates head position by reflex activation of neck muscles in 
response to the stimulation of the semicircular canals re- 
sulting from rotational accelerations of the head. Neurons 
in the lateral vestibular nucleus are the source of the lateral

vestibulospinal tract, which courses through the anterior 
white matter of the spinal cord in a slightly more lateral 
position relative to the medial vestibulospinal tract. Despite 
the modifier in its name, the lateral vestibulospinal tract 
terminates among medial lower motor neuronal pools that 
govern proximal muscles of the limbs. As discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 14, this tract facilitates the activation of 
limb extensor (antigravity) muscles when the otolith organs 
signal deviations from stable balance and upright posture. 
Other upper motor neurons in the vestibular nuclei project 
to local circuit neurons and lower motor neurons in the 
cranial nerve nuclei that control eye movements (the third, 
fourth, and sixth cranial nerve nuclei). This pathway pro- 
duces the eye movements that maintain fixation while the 
head is moving (the vestibulo-ocular reflex; see Chapters 
14 and 20). 
The reticular formation is a complicated network of cir- 
cuits in the core of the brainstem that extends from the ros- 
tral midbrain to the caudal medulla; it is similar in structure 
and function to circuitry in the intermediate gray matter of 
the spinal cord (Figure 17.12 and Box 17D). Unlike the well- 
defined sensory and motor nuclei of the cranial nerves, the

motor neurons in the medial part

vestibular nuclei (A) and the reticular

Pontine and 
medullary 
reticular 
formation 
reticular formation comprises clusters of neurons scattered 
among a welter of interdigitating axon bundles; it is there- 
fore difficult to subdivide anatomically. The neurons within 
the reticular formation have a variety of functions, includ- 
ing cardiovascular and respiratory control (see Chapter 21), 
governance of myriad sensory motor reflexes (see Chapters 
16 and 21), coordination of eye movements (see Chapter 
20), regulation of sleep and wakefulness (see Chapter 28), 
and, most important for the purpose of this discussion, the 
temporal and spatial coordination of limb and trunk move- 
ments. The descending motor contro! pathways from the 
reticular formation to the spinal cord are similar to those of 
the vestibular nuclei; they terminate primarily in the me- 
dial parts of the gray matter, where they influence the lo- 
cal circuit neurons that coordinate axial and proximal limb 
muscles (see Figure 17.11B). 
Both the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation 
provide information to the spinal cord that maintains pos- 
ture in response to environmental (or self-induced) dis- 
turbances of body position and stability. Direct projections 
from the vestibular nuclei to the spinal cord ensure a rapid 
compensatory feedback response to any postural instability

If one were to exclude from the struc- 
ture of the brainstem the cranial nerve 
nuclei, the nuclei that provide input 
to the cerebellum, the long ascend- 
ing and descending tracts that convey 
explicit sensory and motor signals, and 
the structures that lie dorsal and lateral 
to the ventricular system, what would 
be left is a central core region known 
as the tegmentum (Latin for "covering 
structure"), so named because it "cov- 
ers" the ventral part of the brainstem. 
Scattered among the diffuse fibers that 
course through the tegmentum are 
small clusters of neurons that are col- 
lectively known as the reticular forma- 
tion. With few exceptions, these clusters 
of neurons are difficult to recognize as 
distinct nuclei in standard histological 
preparations. Indeed, the modifying 
term reticular (netlike) was applied to 
this loose collection of neuronal clusters 
because early neurohistologists envi- 
sioned these neurons as part of a sparse 
network of diffusely connected cells 
that extends from the intermediate gray 
regions of the cervical spinal cord to the 
lateral regions of the hypothalamus and 
certain nuclei along the midline of the 
thalamus. 
These early anatomical concepts 
were influenced by lesion experiments 
in animals and clinical observations in 
human patients made in the 1930s and 
1940s. These studies showed that dam- 
age to the upper brainstem tegmentum 
produced coma, suggesting the existence 
of a neural system in the midbrain and 
rostral pons that supported normal 
conscious brain states and transitions 
between sleep and wakefulness. These 
ideas were articulated most influentially 
by G. Moruzzi and H. Magoun when 
they proposed a "reticular activating 
system" to account for these functions 
and the critical role of the brainstem 
reticular formation. 
Current evidence generally supports 
the notion of an activating function of 
the rostral reticular formation; how- 
ever, neuroscientists now recognize the 
complex interplay of a variety of neu- 
rochemical systems (with diverse post- 
synaptic effects) comprising distinct cell 
clusters in the rostral tegmentum, and 
a myriad of other functions performed 
by neuronal clusters in more caudal 
parts of the reticular formation. Thus, 
with the advent of more precise means 
of demonstrating anatomical connec- 
tions, as well as more sophisticated 
means of identifying neurotransmitters 
and the activity patterns of individual 
neurons, the concept of a "sparse net- 
work" engaged in a common function

Caudal pontine and medullary reticular 
formation 
Premotor coordination of lower somatic 
and visceral motor neuronal pools 
is now obsolete. Nevertheless, the term 
reticular formation remains, as does the 
daunting challenge of understanding 
_ 
the anatomical complexity and func- 
tional heterogeneity of this intricate 
brain region. Fortunately, two simplify- 
ing generalizations can be made. First, 
the functions of the different clusters of 
neurons in the reticular formation can 
be grouped into two broad categories: 
modulatory functions and premotor func- 
tions. Second, the modulatory functions 
are primarily found in the rostral sec- 
tor of the reticular formation, whereas 
the premotor functions are localized in 
more caudal regions. 
Several clusters of large ("magno- 
cellular") neurons in the midbrain 
and rostral pontine reticular formation 
participate—together with certain dien- 
cephalic nuclei—in the modulation of 
conscious states (see Chapter 28). These 
effects are accomplished by long-range, 
diencephalic projections of cholinergic 
neurons near the superior cerebellar 
peduncle, as well as the more wide- 
spread forebrain projections of norad- 
renergic neurons in the locus coeruleus 
and serotonergic neurons in the raphe 
Mesencephalic and rostral 
pontine reticular formation

nuclei. Generally speaking, these bio- 
genic amine neurotransmitters function 
as neuromodulators (see Chapter 6) 
that alter the membrane potential and 
thus the firing patterns of thalamocorti- 
cal and cortical neurons (the details of 
these effects are explained in Chapter 
28). Also included in this category are 
the dopaminergic systems of the ventral 
midbrain that modulate cortico-striatal 
interactions in the basal ganglia (see 
Chapter 18) and the responsiveness 
of neurons in the prefrontal cortex 
and limbic forebrain (see Chapter 29), 
However, not all modulatory projec- 
tions from the rostral reticular forma- 
tion are directed toward the forebrain. 
Although not always considered part of 
the reticular formation, it is helpful to 
include in this functional group certain 
neuronal columns in the periaqueductal 
gray (surrounding the cerebral aque- 
duct) that project to the dorsal horn of 
the spinal cord and modulate the trans- 
mission of nociceptive signals 
(see Chapter 10).

caudal pons and medulla oblongata

back sensory signals with executive

commands from upper motor neurons 
and deep cerebellar nuclei and, in turn, 
organize the efferent activities of lower 
visceral motor and certain somatic 
motor neurons in the brainstem and 
spinal cord. Examples of this functional 
category include the smaller (parvocel- 
lular) neurons that coordinate a broad 
range of motor activities, including 
the gaze centers discussed in Chapter 
20 and local circuit neurons near the 
somatic motor and branchiomotor 
nuclei that organize mastication, facial 
expressions, and a variety of reflexive 
orofacial behaviors such as sneezing, 
hiccupping, yawning, and swallow- 
ing. In addition, "autonomic centers" 
organize the efferent activities of spe- 
cific pools of primary visceral motor 
neurons. Included in this subgroup are 
distinct clusters of neurons in the ven- 
trolateral medulla that generate respira- 
tory rhythms, and others that regulate 
the cardioinhibitory output of neurons 
in the nucleus ambiguus. Still other 
clusters organize more complex activi- 
ties that require the coordination of 
both somatic motor and visceral motor 
outflow, such as gagging and vomiting, 
and even laughing and crying. 
One set of neuronal clusters that 
does not fit easily into this rostral- 
caudal framework is the set of neurons 
that give rise to the reticulospinal pro- 
jections. As described in the text, these 
neurons are distributed in both rostral 
and caudal sectors of the reticular 
formation, and they give rise to lone- 
range projections that innervate lower 
motor neuronal pools in the medial 
ventral horn of the spinal cord. The 
reticulospinal inputs serve to modulate 
the gain of segmental reflexes involving 
the muscles of the trunk and proximal 
limbs and to initiate certain stereotypi- 
cal patterns of limb movement. 
In summary, the reticular forma- 
tion is best viewed as a heterogeneous

detected by the vestibular labyrinth (see Chapter 14). In 
contrast, the motor centers in the reticular formation are 
controlled largely by other motor centers in the cerebral 
cortex, hypothalamus, or brainstem. The relevant neurons 
in the reticular formation initiate feedforward adjustments 
that stabilize posture during ongoing movements. 
The way neurons of the reticular formation maintain 
posture can be appreciated by analyzing their activity dur- 
ing voluntary movements. Even the simplest movements 
are accompanied by the activation of muscles that at first 
glance seem to have little to do with the primary purpose of

the movement. For example, Figure 17.13 shows the pattern 
of muscle activity that occurs as a subject uses his arm to 
pull on a handle in response to an auditory tone. Activity in 
the biceps muscle begins about 200 milliseconds after the 
tone. However, as the records show, the contraction of the 
biceps is accompanied by a significant increase in the activ- 
ity of a proximal leg muscle, the gastrocnemius (as well as 
many other muscles not monitored in the experiment). In 
fact, contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle begins well 
before contraction of the biceps. 
These observations show that postural control during 
movement entails an anticipatory, or feedforward, mecha- 
nism (Figure 17.14). As part of the motor plan for moving 
the arm, the effect of the impending movement on body 
stability is "evaluated" and used to generate a change in the 
activity of the gastrocnemius muscle. This change actually 
precedes and provides preparatory postural support for the 
movement of the arm. In the example given in Figure 17.13, 
contraction of the biceps would tend to pull the entire body 
forward, an action that is opposed by the contraction of the 
gastrocnemius muscle. In short, this feedforward mecha- 
nism predicts the resulting disturbance in body stability and 
generates an appropriate stabilizing response.

Feedback for 
unanticipated 
postural instability 
FIGURE 17.14 
Feedforward and feedback mechanisms of 
postural control. Feedforward postural responses are "prepro- 
grammed" and typically precede the onset of limb movement 
(see Figure 17.13). Feedback responses are initiated by sensory 
inputs that detect postural instability.

CHAPTER 17 
The importance of the reticular formation for feedfor- 
ward mechanisms of postural control has been explored 
in more detail in cats trained to use a forepaw to strike an 
object. As expected, the forepaw movement is accompanied 
by feedforward postural adjustments in the other legs to 
maintain the animal upright. These adjustments shift the 
animal's weight from an even distribution over all four feet 
to a diagonal distribution pattern, in which the weight is 
carried mostly by the contralateral, nonreaching forelimb 
and the ipsilateral hindlimb. Lifting of the forepaw and pos- 
tural adjustments in the other limbs can also be induced in 
an alert cat by electrical stimulation of the motor cortex. Af- 
ter pharmacological inactivation of the reticular formation, 
however, electrical stimulation of the motor cortex evokes 
only the forepaw movement, without the feedforward pos- 
tural adjustments that normally accompany them. 
The results of this experiment can be understood in 
terms of the fact that the upper motor neurons in the motor 
cortex influence the spinal cord circuits by two routes: direct 
projections to the spinal cord (as discussed above) and in- 
direct projections to brainstem centers that in turn project 
to the spinal cord. The reticular formation is one of the ma- 
jor destinations of these latter projections from the motor 
cortex; thus, cortical upper motor neurons initiate both the 
reaching movement of the forepaw and also the postural 
adjustments in the other limbs necessary to maintain body 
stability. The forepaw movement is initiated by the direct 
pathway from the cortex to the spinal cord, whereas the 
postural adjustments are mediated via pathways from the 
motor cortex that reach the spinal cord indirectly, after an 
intervening relay in the reticular formation (the so-called 
cortico-reticulospinal pathway; Figure 17.15). 
Further evidence for the contrasting functions of the di- 
rect and indirect pathways from the motor cortex to the spi- 
nal cord comes from experiments carried out by the Dutch 
neurobiologist Hans Kuypers, who examined the behav- 
ior of rhesus monkeys that had the direct pathway to the 
spinal cord transected at the level of the medulla, leaving 
the indirect pathways to the spinal cord via the brainstem 
centers intact. Immediately after the surgery, the animals 
were able to use axial and proximal muscles to stand, walk, 
run, and climb, but they had great difficulty using the distal 
parts of their limbs (especially their hands) independently 
FIGURE 17.15 
Indirect pathways from the motor cortex to the spi- 
nal cord. Neurons in the motor cortex that supply the lateral part of the 
ventral horn to initiate movements of the distal limbs (see Figure 17.4) also 
terminate on neurons in the reticular formation to mediate postural adjust- 
ments that support the movement. The reticulospinal pathway terminates 
in the more medial parts of the ventral horn, where lower motor neurons 
that innervate axial and proximal muscles are located. Thus, the motor 
cortex can influence the activity of spinal cord neurons via both direct and 
indirect routes. 
of other body movements. For example, the monkeys could 
cling to the cage but were unable to reach toward and pick 
up food with their fingers; rather, they used the entire arm 
to sweep the food toward them. After several weeks, the 
animals recovered some independent use of their hands 
and were again able to pick up objects of interest, but this 
action involved the concerted closure of all of the fingers.

UPPER MOTOR NEURON CONTROL OF THE BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD 
395 
The ability to make independent, fractionated movements 
of the fingers, as in opposing the movements of the fingers 
and thumb to pick up an object, never returned. 
These observations show that following damage to the 
direct projections from the motor cortex to the spinal cord 
at the level of the medulla, the indirect projections from the 
motor cortex via the brainstem centers (or from brainstem 
centers alone) are capable of sustaining motor behavior that 
involves primarily the use of proximal muscles. In contrast, 
the direct projections from the motor cortex to the spinal 
cord provide the speed and agility of movements, and they 
enable a higher degree of precision in fractionated finger 
movements than is possible using the indirect pathways 
alone. 
An additional brainstem structure, the superior col- 
liculus, which is located in the dorsal midbrain, also con- 
tributes upper motor neuron pathways that govern lower 
motor neurons in the spinal cord. Although most mammals 
are likely to have direct projections from neurons in deep 
layers of the superior colliculus to the spinal cord (com- 
prising a so-called colliculospinal or tectospinal tract), the 
major output of the superior colliculus to the spinal cord 
is mediated by the reticular formation. Thus, upper motor 
neurons in the superior colliculus innervate neural circuits 
in the reticular formation, which in turn give rise to reticu- 
lospinal projections that supply medial cell groups in the 
cervical cord. Functionally, this pathway plays a role in con- 
trolling axial musculature in the neck. These projections are 
particularly important in generating orienting movements 
of the head (Chapter 20 provides a detailed description of 
the role of the superior colliculus in the generation of head 
and eye movements). 
In non-human primates and other mammals, a large 
nucleus in the tegmentum of the midbrain, termed the red 
nucleus, projects via the rubrospinal tract to the cervical 
level of the spinal cord (rubro—Latin for red—tefers to the 
reddish color of this nucleus in fresh tissue, presumably due 
to the enrichment of its neurons with iron—protein com- 
plexes). Unlike the other projections from the brainstem 
to the spinal cord discussed thus far, the rubrospinal tract 
is located in the lateral white matter of the spinal cord; its 
axons terminate in lateral regions of the ventral horn and 
intermediate zone, where circuits of lower motor neurons 
governing the distal musculature of the upper extremities 
reside. Presumably, this projection participates together 
with the direct pathway from the motor cortex in the con- 
trol of the arms (or forepaws). The limited distribution of 
rubrospinal projections may seem surprising, given the 
large size of the red nucleus in most mammals. However, 
the rubrospinal tract arises from especially large (magnocel- 
lular) neurons in the caudal pole of the red nucleus, which 
account for a relatively small fraction of the total number of 
neurons in the nucleus. In the human midbrain, there are 
very few—if any—large neurons in the red nucleus; thus, 
if the rubrospinal tract exists in humans (which may not 
be the case), its significance for motor control is dubious. 
Indeed, nearly all of the neurons in the red nucleus in hu- 
mans are small (parvocellular) and do not project to the 
spinal cord at all; many of these neurons relay information 
to the inferior olive, an important source of learning signals 
for the cerebellum (this role of the red nucleus is discussed 
in Chapter 19). 
Damage to Descending Motor 
Pathways: The Upper Motor 
Neuron Syndrome 
Injury to upper motor neurons is common because of the 
large amount of cortex occupied by the motor areas and 
because their pathways extend all the way from the cerebral 
cortex to the lower end of the spinal cord. Damage to the 
descending motor pathways anywhere along this trajectory 
gives rise to a set of symptoms called upper motor neuron 
syndrome. This clinical picture differs markedly from the 
lower motor neuron syndrome described in Chapter 16 and 
entails a characteristic set of motor deficits (Table 17.1). 
Damage to the motor cortex or the descending upper 
motor axons in the internal capsule causes an immediate 
flaccidity of the muscles on the contralateral side of the body 
and lower face. Given the topographical arrangement of the 
motor system, identifying the specific parts of the body that 
are affected helps localize the site of the injury. The acute 
manifestations tend to be most severe in the arms and legs. 
If the affected limb is elevated and released, it drops pas- 
sively, and all reflex activity on the affected side is abolished. 
In contrast, control of trunk muscles is usually preserved, 
either by the remaining brainstem pathways or because 
of the bilateral projections of the corticospinal pathway to 
local circuits that control midline musculature. This initial 
period of "hypotonia" after upper motor neuron injury is

called spinal shock and reflects the decreased activity of

cortex and brainstem. 
After several days, however, the spinal cord circuits re- 
gain much of their function for reasons that are not fully un- 
derstood, but may include the strengthening of remaining 
connections and the sprouting of new connections. There- 
after, a consistent pattern of motor signs and symptoms 
emerges, including: 
® The Babinski sign. The normal response in an adult to 
stroking the sole of the foot is flexion of the big toe, and 
often the other toes. Following damage to descending 
upper motor neuron pathways, however, this stimulus 
may elicit extension of the big toe and a fanning of the 
other toes (Figure 17.16). A similar response occurs in 
human infants before the maturation of the corticospinal 
pathway and presumably indicates incomplete upper 
motor neuron control of local motor neuron circuitry. 
® Spasticity. Spasticity is increased muscle tone (Box 17B), 
hyperactive stretch reflexes, and clonus (oscillatory 
contractions and relaxations of muscles in response

to muscle stretching). Extensive upper motor neuron 
lesions may be accompanied by rigidity of the exten- 
sor muscles of the leg and the flexor muscles of the 
arm (called decerebrate rigidity; see below). Spasticity is 
probably caused by the removal of suppressive influ- 
ences exerted by the cortex on the postural centers of 
the vestibular nuclei and reticular formation. In experi- 
mental animals, for instance, lesions of the vestibular 
nuclei ameliorate the spasticity that follows damage 
to the corticospinal tract. Spasticity is also eliminated 
by sectioning the dorsal roots, suggesting that it rep- 
resents an abnormal increase in the gain of the spinal 
cord stretch reflexes due to loss of descending sup- 
pression (see Chapter 16). This increased gain is also 
thought to explain clonus. 
© Loss of the ability to perform fine movements. If the lesion 
involves the descending pathways that control the 
lower motor neurons to the upper limbs, the ability to 
execute fine movements (such as independent move- 
ments of the fingers) is lost. 
Although these upper motor neuron signs and symptoms 
may arise from damage anywhere along the descending 
pathways, the spasticity that follows damage to descend- 
ing pathways in the spinal cord is less marked than the 
spasticity that follows damage to the cortex or internal 
capsule. For example, the spastic extensor muscles in the 
legs of a patient with spinal cord damage cannot support 
the individual's body weight, whereas those of a patient 
with damage at the cortical level often can. On the other 
hand, lesions that interrupt the descending pathways in the 
brainstem above the level of the vestibular nuclei but be- 
low the level of the red nucleus cause even greater extensor 
tone than that which occurs after damage to higher regions. 
Sherrington, who first described this phenomenon, called 
the increased tone decerebrate rigidity. In the cat, the ex- 
tensor tone in all four limbs is so great after lesions that 
spare the vestibulospinal tracts that the animal can stand 
without support. Patients with severe brainstem injury at 
the level of the pons may exhibit similar signs of decerebra- 
tion: arms and legs stiffly extended, jaw clenched, and neck 
retracted, The relatively greater hypertonia following dam- 
age to the nervous system above the level of the spinal cord 
is presumably explained by the remaining activity of the 
intact descending pathways from the vestibular nuclei and 
reticular formation, which evidently have a net excitatory 
influence on the gain of segmental reflexes. 

BOX 17E Muscle Tone 
UPPER MOTOR NEURON CONTROL OF THE BRAINSTEM AND SPINAL CORD 
397 
| 
Muscle tone refers to the resting level of 
_ tension in a muscle. In general, main- 
_ taining an appropriate level of tone 
_ allows a muscle to respond optimally 
to voluntary or reflexive commands in 
a given context. Tone in the extensor 
_ muscles of the legs, for example, helps 
_ maintain posture while standing. By 
_ keeping the muscles in a state of readi- 
_ ness to resist stretch, tone in the leg 
muscles prevents the amount of sway 
that normally occurs while standing 
from becoming too large. During activi- 
ties such as walking or running, the 
"background" level of tension in leg 
muscles also helps to store mechanical 
energy, in effect enhancing the muscle 
tissue's springlike qualities. 
Muscle tone depends on the resting 
level of discharge of a motor neurons. 
Activity in muscle spindle afferents— 
the neurons responsible for the stretch 
reflex—is the major contributor to this 
tonic level of firing. As described in 
Chapter 16, the y efferent system (by 
its action on intrafusal muscle fibers) 
regulates the resting level of activity in 
spindle afferents and thus establishes 
the baseline level of a motor neu- 
ron activity in the absence of muscle 
stretch. 
Clinically, muscle tone is assessed 
by judging the resistance of a patient's 
limb to passive stretch. Damage to 
either the a motor neurons or the spin- 
dle afferents carrying sensory informa- 
tion to the a motor neurons results in a 
decrease in muscle tone, called hypoto- 
nia. In general, damage to descending 
pathways that terminate in the spinal 
cord has the opposite effect, leading to 
an increase in muscle tone, or hyper- 
tonia (except during the initial phase 
of spinal shock; see text). The neural 
changes responsible for hypertonia fol- 
lowing damage to higher centers are 
not well understood; however, at least 
part of this change is due to an increase 
in the responsiveness of a motor neu- 
rons to spindle afferent inputs. Thus, 
in experimental animals in which 
descending inputs have been severed, 
the resulting hypertonia can be elimi- 
nated by sectioning the dorsal roots. 
Increased resistance to passive 
movement following damage to higher 
centers is called spasticity and is asso- 
ciated with two other characteristic 
signs: the clasp-knife phenomenon, 
and clonus. When first stretched, a 
spastic muscle provides a high level 
of resistance to the stretch and then 
suddenly yields, much like the blade of 
a pocket knife (or clasp knife, in old- 
fashioned terminology). Hyperactivity 
of the stretch reflex loop is the reason 
for the increased resistance to stretch 
in the clasp-knife phenomenon. The 
physiological basis for the inhibition 
that causes the sudden collapse of the 
stretch reflex (and loss of muscle tone) 
_ may involve the activation of Golgi ten- 
don organs (see Chapter 16). 
Clonus refers to a rhythmic pattern 
of contractions (3-7 per second) due 
to the alternate stretching and unload- 
ing of the muscle spindles in a spastic 
muscle. Clonus can be demonstrated in 
the flexor muscles of the leg by push- 
ing up on the sole of patient's foot to 
dorsiflex the ankle. If there is damage 
to descending upper motor neuron 
pathways, holding the ankle loosely in 
this position generates rhythmic con- 
tractions of both the gastrocnemius and 
soleus muscles. Both the increase in 
muscle tone and the pathological oscil- 
lations seen after damage to descending 
pathways are very different from the 
tremor at rest and cogwheel rigidity 
present in basal ganglia disorders such 
as Parkinson's disease, phenomena 
discussed in Chapters 18 and 19. 
Summary 
Two sets of upper motor neuron pathways make distinct 
contributions to the control of the local circuitry in the 
brainstem and spinal cord. One set originates from neu- 
rons in the frontal lobe and includes projections from the 
primary motor cortex and the nearby premotor areas. The 
premotor cortices are responsible for planning and select- 
ing movements, especially movements that are triggered 
by sensory cues or internal motivations, whereas the pri- 
mary motor cortex is especially involved with the execu- 
tion of skilled movements of the limb and facial muscula- 
ture. The motor cortex influences movements directly by 
contacting lower motor neurons and local circuit neurons 
in the spinal cord and brainstem; and indirectly by inner- 
vating neurons in brainstem centers (mainly the reticular 
formation) that in turn project to lower motor neurons and 
circuits. The other major upper motor neuron pathway 
originates from brainstem centers—primarily the reticular 
formation and the vestibular nuclei—and is responsible 
for postural regulation. The reticular formation is espe- 
cially important in feedforward control of posture (that is, 
movements that occur in anticipation of changes in body 
stability). In contrast, the neurons in the vestibular nuclei 
that project to the spinal cord are especially important in 
feedback postural mechanisms (i.e., in producing move- 
ments that are generated in response to sensory signals 
that indicate an existing postural disturbance). Although 
the brainstem pathways can independently organize gross 
motor control, direct projections from the motor cortex to 
local circuit neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord are 
essential for the fine, fractionated movements of the face 
and the distal parts of the limbs that are especially impor- 
tant in our daily lives.

Overview 
IN CONTRAST TO THE MOTOR REGIONS of the cerebral cortex and brainstem 
and their resident upper motor neurons (discussed in the previous chapter), the 
basal ganglia and cerebellum do not project directly either to local circuit or lower 
motor neurons; instead, these brain regions influence movement by regulating the 
activity of upper motor neurons. The term basal ganglia refers to a large and function- 
ally diverse set of nuclei that lies deep within the cerebral hemispheres. The subset 
of these nuclei relevant to this account of motor function includes the caudate, the 
putamen, and the globus pallidus. Two additional structures, the substantia nigra 
in the base of the midbrain and the subthalamic nucleus in the ventral thalamus, 
are closely associated with the motor functions of these basal ganglia nuclei. The 
motor components of the basal ganglia, together with the substantia nigra and the 
subthalamic nucleus, make a subcortical loop that links most areas of the cerebral 
cortex with upper motor neurons in the primary motor and premotor cortices and 
the brainstem. The neurons in this loop modulate their activity in anticipation of and 
during movements, and their effects on upper motor neurons are required for the 
normal performance of voluntary movements. When one of these components of 
the basal ganglia or associated structures is compromised, the motor systems can- 
not switch smoothly between commands that initiate 
a movement and those that 
terminate the movement. The disordered movements that result can be understood 
as a consequence of abnormal upper motor neuron activity in the absence of the 
regulatory control normally provided by the basal ganglia. 
Projections to the Basal Ganglia 
The motor nuclei of the basal ganglia are divided into several functionally distinct 
eroups. The first and larger of these groups is called the corpus striatum, which in- 
cludes two principle nuclei, the caudate and the putamen (Figure 18.1). The name 
corpus striatum, which means "striped body," reflects the fact that the caudate and the 
dorsal part of the putamen are joined by slender bridges of gray matter that extend 
through the internal capsule and confer a striped appearance in parasagittal sections 
through this area. The two subdivisions of the corpus striatum comprise the input

Motor components of the basal ganglia. The 
human basal ganglia comprise a set of gray matter structures, 
most of which are buried deep in the telencephalon, although 
some are found in the diencephalon and midbrain. The major 
components that receive and process movement-related signals 
are the corpus striatum (caudate and putamen) and the palli- 
dum (globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata). These 
structures border the internal capsule in the forebrain and mid- 
brain (the cerebral peduncle is a caudal extension of the internal 
capsule). Smaller but functionally significant components of the 
basal ganglia system are the substantia nigra pars compacta 
and the subthalamic nucleus, which provide input to the cor- 
pus striatum and pallidum, respectively. For the control of limb 
movements, output from the basal ganglia arises in the internal 
segment of the globus pallidus and is sent to the ventral anterior 
and ventral lateral nuclei (VA/VL complex) of the thalamus, which 
interact directly with circuits of upper motor neurons in frontal 
cortex. The substantia nigra pars reticulata projects to upper 
motor neurons in the superior colliculus and controls orienting 
movements of the eyes and head.

zone of the basal ganglia, their neurons being the des- 
tinations of most of the pathways that reach this com- 
plex from other parts of the brain (Figure 18.2). The 
destinations of the incoming axons from the cerebral 
cortex are the dendrites of a class of cells in the corpus 
striatum called medium spiny neurons (Figure 18.3). 
The large dendritic trees of these neurons allow them 
to integrate input from a variety of cortical, thalamic, 
and brainstem structures. The axons arising from the 
medium spiny neurons converge on neurons in the 
pallidum, which includes the globus pallidus and 
the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The globus pal- 
lidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata are the main 
sources of output from the basal ganglia complex (see 
Figure 18.4). 
Nearly all regions of the cerebral cortex project di- 
rectly to the corpus striatum, making the cortex the 
source of the largest input to the basal ganglia. The 
heaviest projections are from association areas in the 
frontal and parietal lobes, but substantial contributions 
also arise from the temporal, insular, and cingulate 
cortices. All of these projections, referred to collectively

cerebral cortex, can be modulated by dopamine and the inputs 
of local circuit neurons. The primary output of the medium spiny

as the corticostriatal pathway, travel through the subcorti- 
cal white matter on their way to the caudate and putamen 
(see Figure 18.2). 
The cortical inputs to the caudate and putamen are 
not equivalent, however, and the differences in input re- 
flect functional differences between these two nuclei. The 
caudate receives cortical projections primarily from mul- 
timodal association cortices and from motor areas in the 
frontal lobe that control eye movements. As the name im- 
plies, the association cortices do not process any one type 
of sensory information; rather, they receive input from a

number of primary and secondary sensory cortices and as- 
sociated thalamic nuclei (see Chapter 26). The putamen, 
on the other hand, receives input from the primary and 
secondary somatic sensory cortices in the parietal lobe, the 
higher order (extrastriate) visual cortices in the occipital 
and temporal lobes, the premotor and motor cortices in 
the frontal lobe, and the auditory association areas in the 
temporal lobe. The fact that different cortical areas project 
to different regions of the striatum implies that the corti- 
costriatal pathway consists of multiple parallel pathways 
serving different functions. This interpretation is supported 
by the observation that the segregation is maintained in 
the structures that receive projections from the striatum 
and in the pathways that project from the basal ganglia to 
other brain regions. 
The distribution of parallel corticostriatal pathways within 
the corpus striatum reflects the functional organization of 
the cerebral cortex. For example, visual and somatic sensory 
cortical projections are topographically mapped within dif- 
ferent regions of the putamen. Moreover, the cortical areas 
that are functionally interconnected at the level of the cor- 
tex give rise to projections that overlap extensively in the

CHAPTER 18 
striatum. Anatomical studies by Ann Graybiel and her col- 
leagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have 
shown that regions of different cortical areas concerned with 
the hand (see Chapter 9) converge in specific rostrocaudal 
bands within the striatum; conversely, regions in the same 
cortical areas concerned with the leg converge in other stria- 
tal bands. These rostrocaudal bands therefore appear to be 
functional units concerned with the movement of particular 
body parts. Another study by the same group showed that 
the more extensive the interconnections of cortical areas by 
corticocortical pathways, the greater the overlap in their pro- 
jections to the striatum. Thus, the specialization of functional 
units within the corpus striatum reflects the specialization of 
the cortical areas that provide input. 
A further indication of functional subdivision within the 
corpus striatum is evident when tissue sections obtained 
post mortem are stained for the presence of different neu- 
rotransmitters and their related enzymes. For example, 
when the striatum is stained for the enzyme acetylcho- 
linesterase, which inactivates acetylcholine (see Chapter 
6), a compartmental organization is revealed within the 
striatum. The compartments are defined by lightly stained 
regions, called "patches" or "striosomes," surrounded by 
densely stained tissue, called "matrix." Subsequent stud- 
ies of the distributions of other neurochemicals, includ- 
ing peptide neurotransmitters, have catalogued a variety 
of neuroactive substances that localize to patch or matrix 
compartments. Tract-tracing experiments in animals have 
likewise shown differences between these striatal compatt- 
ments in the sources of their inputs from the cortex and in 
the destinations of their projections to other parts of the 
basal ganglia. For example, the matrix comprises the bulk 
of the corpus striatum; it receives input from most areas of 
the cerebral cortex and sends projections to the globus pal- 
lidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The patches in 
the caudate receive most of their input from the prefrontal 
cortex (see Chapter 26) and project preferentially to a dif- 
ferent subdivision of the substantia nigra (see below). Dis- 
tinct patterns of projection from medium spiny neurons in 
the patches and matrix further support the conclusion that 
functionally distinct pathways project in parallel from the 
cerebral cortex to the corpus striatum. 
The nature of the information transmitted to the caudate 
and putamen from the cerebral cortex is not understood. 
It is known, however, that collateral axons of corticocor- 
tical, corticothalamic, and corticospinal pathways all form 
excitatory glutamatergic synapses on the dendritic spines 
of medium spiny neurons (see Figure 18.3B). The number 
of contacts established between an individual cortical axon 
and a single medium spiny cell is very small, whereas the 
number of spiny neurons contacted by a single axon is ex- 
tremely large. This divergence of the inputs from corticostri- 
atal axons allows a single medium spiny neuron to integrate 
the influences of thousands of cortical cells. 
The medium spiny cells also receive inputs from several 
other sources besides the cerebral cortex, including other 
medium spiny neurons via their local axon collaterals, local 
circuit interneurons of the corpus striatum, neurons in the 
midline and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, and neu- 
rons in several nuclei of the brainstem that produce biogenic 
amine neurotransmitters. In contrast to the cortical inputs 
to the dendritic spines, the local circuit neuron and thalamic 
synapses are made on the dendritic shafts and close to the cell 
soma, where they can modulate the effectiveness of cortical 
synaptic activation of the more distal dendrites. One impor- 
tant set of brainstem inputs is dopaminergic, and it originates 
in a subdivision called the substantia nigra pars compacta 
because of its densely packed cells. (The striatum also re- 
ceives serotonergic inputs from the raphe nuclei; see Chapter 
6.) The dopaminergic synapses are located on the base of the 
spine, in close proximity to the cortical synapses, where they 
selectively modulate cortical input (see Figure 18.3B). As a 
result, input from both the cortex and the substantia nigra 
pars compacta are relatively far from the initial segment of 
the medium spiny neuron axon, where the nerve impulse 
is generated. Furthermore, medium spiny neurons express 
inward-rectifier potassium conductances that tend to remain 
open near resting membrane potentials, but close with de- 
polarization. Accordingly, these neurons exhibit very little 
spontaneous activity and must simultaneously receive many 
excitatory inputs from cortical and nigral neurons to over- 
come the stabilizing influence of this potassium conductance. 
When the medium spiny neurons do become active, 
their firing is associated with the occurrence of a move- 
ment. Extracellular recordings show that these neurons 
typically increase their rate of discharge before an impend- 
ing movement. Neurons in the putamen tend to discharge 
in anticipation of limb and trunk movements, whereas cau- 
date neurons fire prior to eye movement. These anticipatory 
discharges are evidently part of a movement selection pro- 
cess; in fact, they can precede the initiation of movement 
by as much as several seconds. Similar recordings have also 
shown that the discharges of some striatal neurons vary 
according to the location in space of the destination of a 
movement, rather than with the starting position of the 
limb relative to the destination. Thus, the activity of these 
cells may encode the decision to move toward a goal rather 
than the direction and amplitude of the actual movement 
necessary to reach the goal. 
Projections from the Basal Ganglia to 
Other Brain Regions 
The medium spiny neurons of the caudate and putamen 
give rise to inhibitory GABAergic projections that termi- 
nate in the pallidal nuclei in the basal ganglia complex: the 
globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (Fig- 
ure 18.4). Globus pallidus means "pale body," a name that

Substantia nigra 
pars reticulata 
describes the appearance of the large number of myelinated 
axons in this nucleus; pars reticulata is so named because, 
unlike the pars compacta, axons passing through give it a 
netlike, or reticulated, appearance. 
The globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata 
contain the same types of neurons and perform compa- 
rable functions, albeit on the different types of signals they 
receive from the parallel streams of processing that flow 
through the basal ganglia. In fact, the pars reticulata may 
be understood as being a part of the globus pallidus that, 
during early brain development, became displaced to the 
midbrain by the formation of the internal capsule and ce- 
rebral peduncle. The striatal projections to these two nuclei 
resemble the corticostriatal pathways in that they terminate 
in rostrocaudal bands, the locations of which vary with the 
locations of sources in the striatum. A striking feature of 
these projections is the degree of convergence from the 
medium spiny neurons to the neurons of the globus pal- 
lidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. In humans, for

example, the corpus striatum contains approximately 100 
million neurons, about 75% of which are medium spiny 
neurons. In contrast, the main destination of their axons, 
the globus pallidus, comprises only about 700,000 cells. 
Thus, on average, more than 100 medium spiny neurons 
innervate each cell in the globus pallidus. However, de- 
spite this impressive degree of convergence, individual ax- 
ons from the corpus striatum sparsely contact many pallidal 
neurons before terminating densely on the dendrites of a 
particular neuron. Consequently, ensembles of medium 
spiny neurons exert a broad but functionally weak influ- 
ence over many neurons, while at the same time strongly 
influencing a subset of neurons in the globus pallidus or 
substantia nigra pars reticulata. This pattern of innerva- 
tion is important for understanding the role of the corpus 
striatum in the selection and initiation of intended motor 
programs, as described below. 
The efferent neurons of the globus pallidus and substantia 
nigra pars reticulata together give rise to the major pathways 
that allow the basal ganglia to influence the activity of up- 
per motor neurons located in the motor cortex and in the 
brainstem (see Figure 18.4). The pathway to the cortex arises 
primarily in the medial division of the globus pallidus, called 
the internal segment, and reaches the motor cortex via a 
relay in the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei of 
the thalamus. These thalamic nuclei project directly to motor 
areas of the cerebral cortex, thus completing a vast loop of

neural circuitry that originates in multiple areas of the cor- 
tex and terminates in the motor areas of the frontal lobe, 
after successive stages of processing in the basal ganglia and 
thalamus. In contrast, many efferent axons from substantia 
nigra pars reticulata have more direct access to upper motor 
neurons by synapsing on neurons in the superior colliculus 
that command head and eye movements, without an inter- 
vening relay in the thalamus. This difference between the 
globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata is not 
absolute, however, since many reticulata axons also project 
to the thalamus (mediodorsal and ventral anterior nuclei), 
where they contact relay neurons that project to the frontal 
eye fields of the premotor cortex (see Chapter 20). 
Because the efferent cells of both the globus pallidus and 
substantia nigra pars reticulata are GABAergic, the main 
output of the basal ganglia is inhibitory. In contrast to the 
quiescent medium spiny neurons, the neurons in both of 
these output structures have high levels of spontaneous ac- 
tivity that prevent unwanted movement by tonically inhibit- 
ing cells in the thalamus and superior colliculus. Because the 
medium spiny neurons of the striatum also are GABAergic 
and inhibitory, the net effect of the excitatory inputs that 
that in turn initiate movement. 
Evidence from Studies of 
Eye Movements 
The permissive role of the basal ganglia in the initiation of 
movement is perhaps most clearly demonstrated by stud- 
ies of eye movements carried out by Okihide Hikosaka and 
Robert Wurtz at the National Institutes of Health (Figure 
18.6). As described in the previous section, the substantia 
nigra pars reticulata is part of the output circuitry of the 
basal ganglia. Instead of projecting to the ventral ante- 
rior and ventral lateral nuclei of the thalamus, however, it 
sends axons mainly to the deep layers of the superior col- 
liculus. The upper motor neurons in these layers command 
the rapid, orienting movements of the eyes called saccades 
(see Chapter 20). When the eyes are fixating a visual tar- 
get, these upper motor neurons are tonically inhibited by 
the spontaneously active reticulata cells, thus preventing 
unwanted saccades. Shortly before the onset of a-saccade, 
the tonic discharge rate of the reticulata neurons is sharply 
reduced by input from the GABAergic medium spiny neu- 
rons of the caudate, which have been activated by signals

This brief account of the genesis of 
saccadic eye movements provides an 
important illustration of the principal 
functions of the basal ganglia in motor 
control: the basal ganglia facilitate the 
initiation of motor programs that express 
movement and the suppression of com- 
peting or non-synergistic motor pro- 
grams that would otherwise interfere with the expression 
of sensory-driven or goal-directed behavior. Chapter 20 
provides a more complete account of sensorimotor inte- 
gration and the origins of eye movements; the remaining 
sections of this chapter will explain how the intrinsic and 
accessory circuits of the basal ganglia accomplish these 
principal functions in motor control and why disease that

The projections from the medium spiny neurons of the 
caudate and putamen to the internal segment of the glo- 
bus pallidus constitute the so-called "direct pathway" 
from the cortex. The subsequent reduction in the tonic dis-

neurons of the superior colliculus, allowing them to gener- 
neurons that drive upper motor neurons. Thus, this di- 
ate the bursts of action potentials that command the sac- 
rect pathway provides a means for the basal ganglia to 
cade. Thus, the projections from the substantia nigra pars 
facilitate the initiation of volitional movement. Figure

FIGURE 18.7 
Disinhibition in the direct and 
indirect pathways through the basal gan- 
glia. (A) In the direct pathway, transiently inhibi- 
tory neurons in the caudate and putamen project 
to tonically active inhibitory neurons in the inter- 
nal segment of the globus pallidus, which project 
in turn to the VA/VL complex of the thalamus. 
Transiently excitatory inputs to the caudate and 
putamen from the cortex and substantia nigra 
are also shown, as is the transiently excitatory 
input from the thalamus back to the cortex. (B) In 
the indirect pathway (shaded), transiently active 
inhibitory neurons from the caudate and puta- 
men project to tonically active inhibitory neurons 
of the external segment of the globus pallidus. 
Note that the influence of nigral dopaminergic 
input to neurons in the indirect pathway is inhibi- 
tory. The globus pallidus (external segment) neu- 
rons project to the subthalamic nucleus, which 
also receives a strong excitatory input from the 
cortex. The subthalamic nucleus in turn projects 
to the globus pallidus (internal segment), where 
its transiently excitatory drive acts to oppose the 
disinhibitory action of the direct pathway. In this 
way, the indirect pathway modulates the effects 
of the direct pathway.

18.7A summarizes the functional organization of the direct 
pathway. 
To reinforce the suppression of inappropriate move- 
ments, additional circuits of the basal ganglia constitute a 
so-called "indirect pathway" between the corpus striatum 
and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (Figure 
18.7B). This second pathway serves to increase the level of 
tonic inhibition mediated by the projection neurons of the 
internal segment (and the substantia nigra pars reticulata). 
In the indirect pathway, a distinct population of medium 
spiny neurons projects to the lateral division of the globus 
pallidus, called the external segment. The external seg- 
ment of the globus pallidus sends projections to both the 
adjacent internal segment and the subthalamic nucleus 
of the ventral thalamus (see Figure 18.1). The subthalamic 
nucleus also receives excitatory projections from neurons in 
the cerebral cortex that work synergistically with the pro- 
jection from the external segment of the globus pallidus. 
In turn, the subthalamic nucleus projects diffusely back 
to the internal segment of the globus pallidus and to the 
substantia nigra pars reticulata. Thus, the indirect pathway 
feeds back onto the output nuclei that provide the means 
by which the basal ganglia gain access to upper motor 
neurons. But, as will become clear in the following discus- 
sion, the indirect pathway antagonizes the activity of the direct

pathway; together, they function to open or shut the physi- 
ological gates that initiate and terminate movements. 
The indirect pathway through the basal ganelia modu- 
lates the disinhibitory actions of the direct pathway. The 
subthalamic nucleus neurons that project to the internal 
segment of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars 
reticulata use glutamate as their neurotransmitter and are 
excitatory. Normally, when signals from the cortex activate 
the indirect pathway, the medium spiny neurons discharge 
and inhibit the tonically active GABAergic neurons of the 
external globus pallidus. As a result of the removal of this 
tonic inhibition and the simultaneous arrival of excitatory 
inputs from the cerebral cortex, the subthalamic cells be- 
come more active and, by virtue of their excitatory synapses 
with cells of the internal segment of the globus pallidus and 
substantia nigra pars reticulata, they increase the inhibitory 

FIGURE 18.8 
Center-surround functional organization of the direct and 
indirect pathways. Integration of cortical input by the corpus striatum leads 
to the activation of the direct and indirect pathways. With activation of the 
indirect pathway, neurons in a "surround" region of the internal segment of the 
globus pallidus are driven by excitatory inputs from the subthalamic nucleus; 
this reinforces the suppression of a broad set of competing motor programs. 
Simultaneously, activation of the direct pathway leads to the focal inhibition 
of a more restricted "center" cluster of neurons in the internal segment; this in 
turn results in the disinhibition (bottom arrow) of the VA/VL complex and the 
expression of the intended motor program. 
outflow of the basal ganglia. In contrast to the direct path- 
way, which, when activated, releases thalamocortical and 
collicular circuits from tonic inhibition, the net effect of 
activity in the indirect pathway is to increase the inhibi- 
tory influences of the basal ganglia. The balance of activity 
mediated by the direct and indirect pathways is the princi- 
pal determinant of when output from the pallidum to the 
thalamus or superior colliculus will facilitate the expression 
of the intended motor program. 
These circuits not only facilitate the selection of a motor 
program; they also suppress competing motor programs 
that could interfere with the timely expression of sensory- 
driven or goal-oriented behavior. A concept called focused 
selection has guided understanding of this antagonistic in- 
teraction. According to this concept, the direct and indirect 
pathways are functionally organized in a center-surround 
fashion within the output nuclei of the basal ganglia (Figure 
18.8). The influence of the direct pathway is tightly focused 
on particular functional units in the internal segment of the 
globus pallidus (and the substantia nigra pars reticulata), 
whereas the influence of the indirect pathway is much more 
diffuse, covering a broader range of functional units. Recall 
that individual axons from the corpus striatum to the inter- 
nal segment of the globus pallidus tend to synapse densely 
on single pallidal neurons (despite making sparse contacts 
on numerous pallidal cells); this provides a means for the 
direct pathway to focus its input on a "central" functional 
unit at the output stage of the basal ganglia. In contrast, af- 
ferents from the subthalamic nucleus are distributed much 
more evenly throughout the internal segment, providing 
a means for the indirect pathway to influence a broader 
"surrounding" set of functional units. Accordingly, when 
basal ganglia systems receive and process cortical signals, 
the suppression of competing motor programs is reinforced 
and, simultaneously, the activation of the particular thala- 
mocortical (or collicular) circuits that underlie the intended 
movement is facilitated. 
Precisely how the these complex circuits of the basal 
ganglia interact to assist upper motor neuron systems in 
the execution of volitional behavior remains poorly under- 
stood, and this simplified description will undoubtedly be 
subject to revision as further anatomical and physiological

details become available. Nevertheless, this account serves 
as a useful model for understanding the architecture and 
function of neural systems that achieve fine control of their 
output by an interplay between neural excitation and inhi- 
bition (recall, for example, the center-surround antagonism 
of ganglion cell receptive fields in the retina; see Chapter 
11). Furthermore, this model provides an instructive frame- 
work for understanding disorders of movement that result 
from injury or disease that afflicts one or more components 
of the basal ganglia system (see below). 
Dopamine Modulates Basal 
Ganglia Circuits 
As described earlier in this chapter, an important circuit 
within the basal ganglia system involves the dopaminergic 
cells in the pars compacta subdivision of the substantia nigra. 
Although this circuit derives from a relatively small pool of 
dopaminergic neurons, it exerts a profound influence over 
the integration of cortical input in the corpus striatum. The 
medium spiny neurons of the corpus striatum project directly 
to the substantia nigra pars compacta, which in turn sends 

408 
CHAPTER 18 
widespread dopaminergic projections back to the medium 
spiny neurons. The effects of dopamine on the spiny neurons 
are complex; they illustrate the principle that the action of 
a neurotransmitter is determined by the types of receptors 
expressed in postsynaptic neurons and by the downstream 
signaling pathways to which the receptors are linked (see 
Chapter 6). In this case, the same nigral neurons can provide 
excitatory inputs to the spiny cells that project to the internal 
elobus pallidus (the direct pathway) and inhibitory inputs to 
the spiny cells that project to the external globus pallidus (the 
indirect pathway). This duality is achieved by the differential 
expression of two types of dopamine receptors—types D1 
and D2—by the medium spiny neurons. 
Both D1- and D2-type dopamine receptors are members 
of the 7-transmembrane, G-protein-coupled family of cell 
surface receptors. The major difference between them is that 
the D1 receptors mediate the activation of G-proteins that 
increase CAMP, while D2 receptors act through different G- 
proteins that decrease cAMP. For either type, the dopaminer- 
gic synapses on medium spiny neurons tend to be located on 
the shafts of the spines that receive synaptic input from the 
cerebral cortex. This arrangement suggests that dopamine 
exerts its effects on the spiny neurons by modulating their 
responses to cortical input, with D1 receptors positioned to 
enhance the excitatory input from cortex and D2 receptors 
positioned to negate this excitation. Since the actions of the 
direct and indirect pathways on the output of the basal gan- 
glia are antagonistic, these different influences of dopamine 
on medium spiny neurons have the same effects—a decrease 
in the inhibitory outflow of the basal ganglia, and the conse- 
quent release of projections from the thalamus to the frontal 
cortex or projections from the superior colliculus to circuits 
of lower motor neurons in the brainstem. 
This dopaminergic input to the corpus striatum may 
contribute to reward-related modulation of behavior. For 
example, in monkeys, the latencies of saccades toward a 
target are shorter when the goal of the movement is as- 
sociated with a larger reward. This effect is eliminated by 
caudate injections of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist 
and enhanced by injections in the same site of the D2 re- 
ceptor antagonist. These results suggest that the influence 
of motivation on motor performance may be modulated 
by circuits in the basal ganglia. The role of dopamine in 
motivated behavior and the deleterious impact of addictive 
substances on dopaminergic modulation of basal ganglia 
function are discussed in more detail in Chapter 29. 
Hypokinetic and Hyperkinetic 
Movement Disorders 
The modulatory influences of this dopaminergic circuit may 
also help explain many of the manifestations of basal gan- 
glia disorders. For example, Parkinson's disease is caused 
by the loss of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons 
(Figure 18.9A). As described above, activation of the nigros- 
triatal projection leads to opposite but synergistic effects on 
the direct and indirect pathways: the release of dopamine 
in the corpus striatum increases the responsiveness of the 
direct pathway to corticostriatal input (a D1 affect) while 
decreasing the responsiveness of the indirect pathway (a D2 
affect). Normally, both of these dopaminergic effects serve 
to decrease the inhibitory outflow of the basal ganglia and 
thus to increase the excitability of upper motor neurons. In 
contrast, when the dopaminergic cells of the pars compacta 
are destroyed, as occurs in Parkinson's disease, the inhibi- 
tory outflow of the basal ganglia is abnormally high, and 
timely thalamic activation of upper motor neurons in the 
motor cortex is therefore less likely (Figure 18.10A).

to generate the transient inhibition from

change in the direct pathway is to sustain the

nal segment) to the thalamus, making tha- 
lamic excitation of the motor cortex less likely 
(thinner arrow from thalamus to frontal cor-

In fact, many of the symptoms seen in Parkinson's dis- 
ease and other hypokinetic movement disorders reflect a 
failure of the disinhibition normally mediated by the basal 
ganglia (Box 18A). Thus, Parkinson's patients tend to have 
diminished facial expressions and lack associated move- 
ments, such as arm-swinging during walking. Indeed, any 
movement is difficult to initiate and, once initiated, is often 
difficult to terminate. Disruption of the same circuits also 
increases the discharge rate of the inhibitory cells in the 
substantia nigra pars reticulata. The resulting increase in 
tonic inhibition reduces the excitability of upper motor neu- 
rons in the superior colliculus, thus reducing the frequency 
and amplitude of saccades. 
ing to greater and often inappropriate motor 
activity. (After DeLong, 1990.) 
| Less tonic 
inhibition 
Support for this explanation of hypokinetic movement 
disorders such as Parkinson's disease comes from studies of 
monkeys in which degeneration of the dopaminergic cells 
of the substantia nigra has been induced by the neurotoxin 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 
Monkeys (or humans) exposed to MPTP develop symptoms 
that are very similar to those of patients with Parkinson's 
disease. Furthermore, a second lesion placed in the sub- 
thalamic nucleus results in significant improvement in the 
ability of these animals to initiate movement, as would be 
expected based on the circuitry of the indirect pathway (see 
Figure 18.10A). 
Knowledge about the indirect pathway within the basal 
ganglia also helps explain the motor abnormalities seen 
in Huntington's disease (Box 18B), an exemplary hyper- 
kinetic movement disorder. In patients with Huntington's

| Described by James Parkinson in 1817, 
this disorder is characterized by tremor 
at rest, slowness of movement (brady- 
kinesia), rigidity of the extremities and 
_ neck, and minimal facial expressions. 
_ Walking entails short steps, stooped 
| posture, and a paucity of associated 
movements such as arm swinging. In 
_ some patients these abnormalities of 
_ motor function are associated with 
_ dementia. Following a gradual onset 
_ between the ages of 50 and 70, the dis- 
_ ease progresses slowly and culminates 
_ in death some 10 to 20 years later. 
The defects in motor function are 
_ due to the progressive loss of dopa- 
| minergic neurons in the substantia 
nigra pars compacta, a population 
_ 
that projects to and innervates neu- 
_ rons in the caudate and putamen (see 
Figure 18.10A). Although the cause of 
the progressive deterioration of these 
dopaminergic neurons is not known, 
genetic investigations provide clues to 
the etiology and pathogenesis. Whereas 
the majority of cases of Parkinson's dis- 
_ ease are sporadic, there may be specific 
disease, medium spiny neurons that project to the external 
segment of the globus pallidus degenerate (Figure 18.9B). 
In the absence of their normal inhibitory input from the 
spiny neurons, the external globus pallidus cells become 
abnormally active; this activity reduces in turn the excitatory 
forms of susceptibility genes that confer 
increased risk of acquiring the disease, 
just as the apoE4 allele increases the 
risk of Alzheimer's disease. Familial 
forms of Parkinson's caused by single 
gene mutations account for less than 
10% of all cases; identification of these 
rare genes, however, is likely to provide 
insight into molecular pathways that 
may underlie the disease. Mutations 
of three distinct genes—a-synuclein, 
Parkin, and DJ-1—have been implicated 
in rare forms of Parkinson's disease. 
Their identification provides an oppor- 
tunity to generate transgenic mice 
a 
carrying the mutant form of the human 
gene, potentially providing an animal 
model in which the pathogenesis can 
usefully be elucidated and therapies can 
be tested. 
In contrast to other neurodegenera- 
tive diseases (such as Alzheimer's dis- 
ease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), 
in Parkinson's disease the spatial distri- 
bution of the degenerating neurons is 
largely restricted to the substantia nigra 
pars compacta. This spatial restriction, 
combined with the defined and rela- 
tively homogeneous phenotype of the 
degenerating neurons (i.e., dopaminer- 
gic neurons), has provided an opportu- 
nity for novel therapeutic approaches to 
this disorder. 
One strategy is gene therapy, the 
correction of a disease phenotype 
through the introduction of new 
genetic information into the affected 
organism. Although still in its infancy, 
this approach has the potential to 
revolutionize treatment of human dis- 
ease. One such therapy proposed for 
Parkinson's disease would enhance 
release of dopamine in the caudate 
and putamen. In principle, this could 
be accomplished by implanting cells 
that have been genetically modi- 
fied to express tyrosine hydroxylase, 
the enzyme that converts tyrosine to 
L-DOPA, which in turn is converted by 
a nearly ubiquitous decarboxylase into 
the neurotransmitter dopamine (see 
Figure 6.10). 
An alternative strategy to treating 
Parkinsonian patients involves "neural 
grafts" using stem cells. Stem cells are 
self-renewing, multipotent progeni- 
tors with broad developmental poten- 
tial (see Chapters 22 and 25). Instead 
of isolating mature dopaminergic 
neurons from the fetal midbrain for 
transplantation, this approach isolates 
neuronal progenitors at earlier stages 
of development, when these cells are 
actively proliferating. Critical to this 
approach is to prospectively identify 
and isolate stem cells that are multipo- 
tent and self-renewing and to identify 
the growth factors needed to promote 
differentiation into the desired pheno- 
type (e.g., dopaminergic neurons). The 
prospective identification and isolation 
of multipotent mammalian stem cells 
has already been accomplished, and 
several factors likely to be important 
in differentiation of midbrain precur- 
sors into dopamine neurons have been 
identified. Establishing the efficacy of 
this approach for Parkinsonian patients 
would increase the possibility of its 
application to other neurodegenerative 
diseases. 
These therapeutic strategies remain 
experimental, while other novel 
approaches are now entering clinical 
practice (see Box 18C); with ongoing 
investigations in animal models and 
clinical studies in human patients, it is 
likely that some of them will succeed.

_ In 1872, a physician named George 
Huntington described a group of 
_ patients seen by his father and grandfa- 
_ ther in their practice in East Hampton, 
_ Long Island. The disease he defined, 
_ which became known as Huntington's 
_ disease (HD), is characterized by the 
gradual onset of defects in behavior, 
cognition, and movement beginning 
in the fourth and fifth decades of life. 
The disorder is inexorably progressive, 
resulting in death within 10 to 20 years. 
HD is inherited in an autosomal domi- 
nant pattern, a feature that has led to a 
much better understanding of its cause 
in molecular terms. 
One of the more common inherited 
_ neurodegenerative diseases, HD usu- 
ally presents as an alteration in mood 
(especially depression) or a change in 
personality that often takes the form of 
increased irritability, suspiciousness, and 
impulsive or eccentric behavior. Defects 
_ 
of memory and attention may also occur. 
The hallmark of the disease, however, is 
a movement disorder consisting of rapid, 
jerky motions with no clear purpose. 
These choreiform movements may be 
_ confined to a finger or may involve a 
whole extremity, the facial musculature, 
or even the vocal apparatus. The move- 
ments themselves are involuntary, but 
the patient often incorporates them into 
apparently deliberate actions, presum- 
ably in an effort to obscure the problem. 
There is no weakness, ataxia, or deficit of 
sensory function. Occasionally the dis- 
_ ease begins in childhood or adolescence. 
The clinical manifestations in juveniles 
include rigidity, seizures, more marked 
dementia, and a rapidly progressive 
course. 
A distinctive neuropathology is 
associated with these clinical mani- 
festations: a profound but selective 
atrophy of the caudate and putamen, 
with some associated degeneration of 
the frontal and temporal cortices (see 
Figure 18.9B). This pattern of destruc- 
tion is thought to explain the disorders 
of movement, cognition, and behavior, 
as well as the sparing of other neuro- 
logical functions. 
The availability of extensive HD 
pedigrees has allowed geneticists to 
decipher the molecular cause of this 
disease. HD was one of the first human 
diseases in which DNA polymorphisms 
were used to localize the mutant gene, 
which in 1983 was mapped to the short 
arm of chromosome 4. This discovery 
led to an intensive effort to identify the 
HD gene within this region by position- 
al cloning. Ten years later, these efforts 
culminated in identification of the gene 
(named Huntingtin) responsible for the 
disease. In contrast to previously recog- 
nized forms of mutations such as point 
mutations, deletions, or insertions, the 
mutation of Huntingtin is an unstable 
triplet repeat. In normal individuals, 
Huntingtin contains between 15 and 
34 repeats, whereas the gene in HD 
patients contains from 42 to over 66 
repeats. 
HD is one of a growing number of 
diseases attributed to unstable DNA 
segments. Other examples are fragile X 
syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, spinal 
and bulbar muscular atrophy, and spi- 
nocerebellar ataxia type 1. In the latter 
two and HD, the repeats consist of a 
DNA segment (CAG) that codes for the 
amino acid glutamine and is present 
within the coding region of the gene. 
The mechanism by which the 
increased number of polyglutamine 
repeats injures neurons is not clear. The 
leading hypothesis is that the increased 
numbers of glutamines alter protein 
folding, which somehow triggers a 
cascade of molecular events culminat- 
ing in dysfunction and neuronal death. 
Interestingly, although Huntingtin 
is expressed predominantly in the 
expected neurons in the basal ganglia, 
it is also present in regions of the brain 
that are not affected in HD. Indeed, the 
gene is expressed in many organs out- 
side the nervous system. How and why 
the mutant Huntingtin uniquely injures 
striatal neurons is unclear. Continuing 
to elucidate this molecular patho- 
genesis will no doubt provide further 
insight into this and other triplet repeat 
diseases.

BOX 18C Deep Brain Stimulation 
_ Since the seminal demonstration by G. 
_ Fritsch and E. Hitzig in the nineteenth 
_ century that bodily movements could 
_ be induced when electrical currents 
_ were applied to cerebral tissue (in this 
- case, motor cortex), clinicians have con- 
_ sidered the possibility that certain neu- 
_ rological disorders affecting volitional 
_ movement could be treated with the 
_ application of acute or chronic electrical 
stimulation to key motor centers in the 
brain. However, it was not until well 
_ after the internally implanted cardiac 
_ pacemaker was introduced in the 1960s 
that technological advances made pos- 
| sible the implantation of a comparable 
device for the focal stimulation of brain 
structures. Such devices were intro- 
duced in the 1990s for the treatment of 
movement disorders, with their targets 
_ being components of the basal ganglia 
and thalamus located deep in the fore- 
brain; hence the common term for this 
_ intervention, "deep brain stimulation." 
Prior to the 1990s, the treatment 
options for patients with movement 
disorders were limited to pharmaco- 
logical intervention (e.g., using drugs 
designed to increase dopamine levels in 
the corpus striatum to treat Parkinson's 
disease; see Box 18A), physical therapy, 
and, in the most intractable cases, 
neurosurgical ablation of sites in the 
basal ganglia and thalamus that gate 
the initiation of movement. For intrac- 
table cases, the introduction of deep 
brain stimulation provided an obviously 
welcome alternative to the permanent 
destruction of brain circuitry. Currently, 
a combination of deep brain stimula- 
tion and pharmacological intervention 
improves the health status of a signifi- 
cant number of patients (more than 
would the use of just one approach). 
Deep brain stimulation entails the 
implantation of battery-powered gen- 
erator units, usually near the clavicles. 
These units produce electrical dis- 
charges that are passed through subcu- 
taneous wires to electrodes implanted

bilaterally into the brain (Figure A). 
(Recall that, with the exception of 
medial divisions of the premotor cortex, 
all of the cortical and subcortical neural 
circuitry in the forebrain that governs 
the activity of upper motor neurons is 
organized unilaterally; therefore, bilat- 
eral deep brain stimulation is neces- 
sary to achieve symmetrical results.) 
The placement of the electrodes 
requires careful stereotaxic surgery 
combined with radiological imaging of 
the patient's brain and electrophysi- 
ological recordings of spontaneous and 
movement-related neuronal activity. 
- 
The neuronal recordings are essential 
so that the neurosurgical team can rec- 
ognize by sight and sound the charac- 
teristic discharge patterns of neurons in 
different nuclei of the basal ganglia and 
thalamus. This is done by displaying 
- 
action potential waveforms on oscillo- 
scopes and audio and computer moni- 
tors (see Figure 18.5). 
Once the target structures are local- 
ized, stimulation is tested to determine 
whether the desired clini- 
cal effect can be observed. 
After recovery from the 
(A) 
implantation procedure, 
the generator units are 
activated and the param- 
eters of stimulation are 
fine-tuned as various com- 
binations of pulse widths, 
current amplitudes, and 
temporal patterns of pulse 
trains are employed and 
modified as needed. 
A careful consideration 
of Figure 18.10 suggests 
several possible target sites 
of deep brain stimulation 
for patients with hypo- 
kinetic or hyperkinetic 
movement disorders. In 
both diagnostic categories, 
neural activity in motor 
nuclei of the thalamus is 
abnormal; accordingly, the 
Electrode 
brain 
implant 
VA/VL complex of the thalamus is an 
appropriate target. However, abnormal 
activity in the thalamus is often the 
consequence of disturbances within 
the basal ganglia itself, and it is argu- 
ably more desirable to manipulate the 
influence of the basal ganglia on thala- 
mocortical circuits rather than directly 
altering neural activity in upper motor 
neuronal circuits by means of exog- 
enous electrical stimulation. Thus, the 
two most common sites for deep brain 
stimulation in patients with movement 
disorders are the internal segment of 
the globus pallidus and the subthalamic 
nucleus. Regardless of whether the 
neurological disorder to be rectified is 
hypokinetic (manifested as difficulty 
in expression of movement) or hyper- 
kinetic (manifested as expression of 
unwanted movement), deep brain stim- 
ulation can be used to override intrinsic, 
pathological discharge patterns with 
stable and highly structured patterns of 
neural activity that better facilitate the

Given the complexity of even a small 
volume of neural tissue (such as might 
be present near the tip of a stimulat- 
ing electrode in the globus pallidus or 
subthalamic nucleus), it is not surpris- 
ing that the exogenous induction of 
electrical currents can lead to complex 
patterns of activity and inactivity in 
the affected neural elements. Different 
intensities of deep brain stimulation 
may lead to the local release of neu- 
rotransmitters and neuromodulators. 
They may also lead to the generation 
_ of action potentials in afferent axons, 
neuronal cell bodies, efferent axons, 
and "fibers of passage" that originate 
elsewhere. However, the effects of 
electrical stimulation on certain intrin- 
sic membrane properties, including 
voltage-dependent ionic conductances, 
may block the generation of action 
potentials, thus silencing the affected 
neurons. Ideally, the net effect of these 
diverse changes is the amelioration of 
abnormal network activity that hinders 
the normal operation of upper motor 
neurons. 
Despite ongoing uncertainties 
regarding its mechanisms of action, 
deep brain stimulation has offered hope 
to thousands of patients who suffer 
neurological dysfunction ranging from 
the movement disorders discussed 
here to related disorders of non-motor 
basal ganglia loops, such as Tourette 
syndrome, depression, and obsessive 
compulsive disorder (see Box 18D). 
The fact that stimulation protocols are 
adjustable provides clinicians with an 
unprecedented ability to manipulate the 
activities and functions of basal ganglia 
circuits whose operations are crucial to 
the normal expression of thought, emo- 
tion, and motor behavior.

The hyperkinetic movement disorders highlight the im- 
portance of the subthalamic nucleus in modulating the out- 
put of the basal ganglia. Indeed, this nucleus has become 
an important target of novel clinical interventions aimed at 
reestablishing permissive patterns of neural activity in basal 
ganglia circuits in human patients (Box 18C). 
As predicted by this account of hypokinetic and hyper- 
kinetic movement disorders, GABA agonists and antago- 
nists applied to substantia nigra pars reticulata of monkeys 
produce symptoms similar to those seen in human basal 
ganglia disease. For example, intranigral injection of bicu- 
culline, which blocks the GABAergic inputs from the striatal 
medium spiny neurons to the reticulata cells, increases the 
amount of tonic inhibition on the upper motor neurons in 
the deep collicular layers. These animals exhibit fewer and 
slower saccades, reminiscent of patients with Parkinson's 
disease. In contrast, injection of the GABA agonist musci- 
mol into the substantia nigra pars reticulata decreases the 
tonic GABAergic inhibition of the upper motor neurons 
in the superior colliculus, with the result that the injected

limbic loop may regulate emotional and 
motivated behavior, as well as the tran- 
sitions from one mood state to another. 
Indeed, the deterioration of cogni- 
tive and emotional function in both 
Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases 
(see Boxes 18A and 18B) could be the 
result of the disruption of these non- 
motor loops. 
In fact, a variety of other disorders 
are now thought to be caused, at least 
in part, by damage to non-motor com- 
ponents of the basal ganglia. For exam-

a result of excessive activity in basal 
ganglia loops that regulate the cogni- 
tive circuitry of the prefrontal speech 
areas. Another example is schizophre- 
nia, which some investigators have 
argued is associated with aberrant 
activity within the limbic and prefrontal 
loops, resulting in hallucinations, delu- 
_ sions, disordered thoughts, and loss of 
_ emotional expression. In support of the

the nucleus accumbens. This structure 
is implicated in both the neuropharma- 
cology of addiction to drugs of abuse 
and to the expression of addictive 
reward-seeking behavior (see Chapter 
29). A challenge for future research is to 
understand more fully the relationships 
between these clinical conditions and 
the functions of the basal ganglia.

tor programs, with equally significant clinical implications 
should injury, disease, or neurochemical imbalance impair 
the function of one or more component of the diverse basal

CHAPTER 18 
Summary 
The contributions of the basal ganglia to motor control are 
apparent from the deficits that result from damage to the 
component nuclei. Such lesions compromise the initiation 
and performance of voluntary movements, as exemplified 
by the paucity of movement typical of Parkinson's disease 
and in the inappropriate "release" of movements character- 
istic of Huntington's disease. The organization of the basic 
circuitry of the basal ganglia indicates how this constella- 
tion of nuclei modulates movement. With respect to motor 
function, the system forms a loop that originates in almost 
every area of the cerebral cortex and eventually terminates, 
after enormous convergence within the basal ganglia, on 
the upper motor neurons in the motor and premotor areas 
of the frontal lobe and in the superior colliculus. The effer- 
ent neurons of the basal ganglia influence the upper mo- 
tor neurons in the cortex by gating the flow of information 
through relays in the ventral nuclei of the thalamus. The 
upper motor neurons in the superior colliculus that initiate 
saccadic eye movements are controlled by monosynaptic 
projections from the substantia nigra pars reticulata. In each 
case, the basal ganglia loops regulate movement by a pro- 
cess of disinhibition that results from the serial interaction 
within the basal ganglia circuitry of two sets of GABAergic 
neurons. Internal circuits within the basal ganglia system 
modulate the amplification of the signals that are transmit- 
ted through the loops.

MODULATION OF 
MOVEMENT BY THE 
CEREBELLUM 
Overview 
IN CONTRAST TO THE UPPER MOTOR NEURONS described in Chapter 17, the 
efferent cells of the cerebellum do not project directly to the local circuits of the brain- 
stem and spinal cord that organize movement, nor do they contact the lower motor 
neurons that innervate muscles. Instead—like the basal ganglia—the cerebellum 
influences movements primarily by modifying the activity patterns of upper motor 
neurons. In fact, the cerebellum sends prominent projections to virtually all circuits 
that govern upper motor neurons. Anatomically, the cerebellum has two main gray 
matter structures: a laminated cerebellar cortex on its surface and clusters of cells 
buried deep in the white matter of the cerebellum referred to collectively as the deep 
cerebellar nuclei. Pathways that reach the cerebellum from other brain regions (in 
humans, predominantly from the cerebral cortex) project to both components by 
means of afferent axons that send branches to both the deep nuclei and the cerebel- 
lar cortex. Neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei are the main source of the output 
from the cerebellum; however, these cells do not simply return the same signals they 
receive. Rather, their spatiotemporal patterns of efferent activity are sculpted by de- 
scending input from the overlying cerebellar cortex. In this way, input signals to the 
cerebellum are modified before being sent to circuits of upper motor neurons in the 
cerebral cortex, by way of thalamic relays, and in the brainstem. The primary function 
of the cerebellum is to detect the difference, or "motor error," between an intended 
movement and the actual movement, and, through its influence over upper motor 
neurons, to reduce the error. These corrections can be made both during the course of 
the movement and as a form of motor learning when the correction is stored. When 
this feedback loop is damaged, as occurs in many cerebellar diseases, the afflicted 
individual makes persistent errors when executing movement. The specific pattern 
of incoordination depends on the location of the damage. 
Organization of the Cerebellum 
The cerebellar hemispheres can be subdivided into three main parts based on differ- 
ences in their sources of input (Figure 19.1A). By far the largest subdivision in hu- 
mans is the cerebrocerebellum. It occupies most of the lateral cerebellar hemisphere

and receives input indirectly from many areas of the ce- 
rebral cortex (Figure 19.2). This region of the cerebellum 
is especially well developed in primates and is particularly 
prominent in humans. The cerebrocerebellum is con- 
cerned with the regulation of highly skilled movements, 
especially the planning and execution of complex spatial 
and temporal sequences of movement (including speech). 
Just medial to the cerebrocerebellum is the spinocerebel- 
lum. The spinocerebellum occupies the median and para- 
median zone of the cerebellar hemispheres and is the only 
part that receives input directly from the spinal cord. The 
more lateral (paramedian) part of the spinocerebellum is 
primarily concerned with movements of distal muscles. The 
median strip of cerebellar hemisphere along the midline, 
called the vermis, is primarily concerned with movements 
of proximal muscles; it also regulates certain types of eye

nuclei in the brainstem and is primarily concerned with the 
vestibulo-ocular reflex (see Chapter 14) and the regulation 
of movements that maintain posture and equilibrium. 
The connections between the cerebellum and other parts 
of the nervous system are made by three large pathways 
called cerebellar peduncles (Figures 19.1B-—D; also see Fig- 
ure 19.3). The superior cerebellar peduncle (or brachium 
conjunctivum) is almost entirely an efferent pathway. The 
neurons that give rise to this pathway are in the deep cer- 
ebellar nuclei. Their axons project to the motor nuclei of 
the dorsal thalamus, which in turn relay signals to circuits 
of upper motor neurons in the primary and premotor divi- 
sions of the motor cortex. Efferent axons in the superior 
peduncle also project directly to upper motor neurons in 
the deep layers of the superior colliculus. In non-human 
species, they also provide input to upper motor neurons in 
the caudal part of the red nucleus. The middle cerebellar 
peduncle (or brachium pontis) is an afferent pathway to 
the cerebellum; most of the cell bodies that give rise to this 
pathway are in the base of the contralateral pons, where 
they form the pontine nuclei (see Figure 19.2). Finally, the 
inferior cerebellar peduncle (or restiform body) is the 
smallest but most complex of the cerebellar peduncles, con- 
taining multiple afferent and efferent pathways. Afferent 
pathways in the inferior peduncle include axons from the 
vestibular nuclei, the spinal cord, and several regions of the 
brainstem tegmentum, while efferent pathways project to 
the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. 
Projections to the Cerebellum 
The cerebral cortex is by far the largest source of input to 
the cerebellum, and the major destination of this input is 
the cerebrocerebellum. These cortical axons do not project 
directly into the cerebellum. Rather, they synapse on neu- 
rons in the pontine nuclei that are located on the same side 
of the brainstem as their hemisphere of origin. The pontine 
nuclei receive input from a wide variety of sources, includ- 
ing almost all areas of the cerebral cortex and the superior 
colliculus. As outlined above, the axons of the cells in the 
pontine nuclei, called transverse pontine fibers, cross the 
midline and enter the cerebellum via the middle cerebel- 
lar peduncle. Each of the two middle cerebellar peduncles 
contains over 20 million axons, making this one of the 
largest pathways in the brain. In comparison, the optic and

the cerebellum. (A) Diagram of the major inputs. (B) Idealized 
coronal and sagittal sections through the human brainstem and 
cerebrum, showing inputs to the cerebellum from the cerebral 
cortex, vestibular system, spinal cord, and brainstem. The corti- 
cal projections to the cerebellum are made via relay neurons in 
the pons. These pontine axons then cross the midline within the 
pons and project to the cerebellum via the middle cerebellar 
peduncle. Axons from the inferior olive, spinal cord, and vestibu- 
lar nuclei enter via the inferior cerebellar peduncle. 
pyramidal tracts each contain about a million axons. Thus, 
the prominence of the cerebral peduncles in the ventral 
portion of the human midbrain (each of which also contains 
about 20 million axons) is primarily due to the magnitude of 
the projection from the cerebral cortex that, via the pontine 
nuclei, enters the cerebellum. (In contrast, the corticospinal 
projection, which is often assumed incorrectly to account 
for the bulk of the cerebral peduncles, comprises a mere 
5% of the total number of axons in each cerebral peduncle.) 
This massive, crossed projection of transverse pontine fi- 
bers into the cerebellum via the middle cerebellar peduncle 
is therefore the means by which signals originating in one 
cerebral hemisphere are sent to neural circuits in the op- 
posite cerebellar hemisphere (Figure 19.3A). 
Sensory pathways also project to the cerebellum (Figure 
19.3B). Vestibular axons from the eighth cranial nerve and 
axons from the vestibular nuclei in the medulla project to 
the vestibulocerebellum. In addition, relay neurons in the 
dorsal nucleus of Clarke in the spinal cord and the exter- 
nal (or accessory) cuneate nucleus of the caudal medulla 
send their axons to the spinocerebellum (recall that these 
nuclei comprise groups of relay neurons innervated by pro- 
prioceptive axons from the lower and upper parts of the 
body, respectively; see Chapter 9). Proprioceptive signals 
from the face are likewise relayed via the mesencephalic 
nucleus of the trigeminal complex to the spinocerebellum. 
The vestibular, spinal, and trigeminal inputs provide the 
cerebellum with information from the labyrinth in the ear,

muscle spindles, and other mechanoreceptors that moni- 
tor the position and motion of the body. Finally, visual and 
auditory signals are relayed via brainstem nuclei to the cer- 
ebellum; presumably, they provide the cerebellum with ad- 
ditional sensory signals that compliment the proprioceptive 
information regarding body position and motion. 
The somatic sensory input remains topographically 
mapped in the spinocerebellum, providing the basis for or- 
derly representations of the body surface within the cere- 
bellum (Figure 19.4). However, these maps are "fractured"; 
that is, fine-grain electrophysiological analysis indicates 
that each small area of the body is represented multiple 
times by spatially separated clusters of cells, rather than 
by a specific site within a single continuous somatotopic 
map. The vestibular and spinal inputs remain ipsilateral as 
they pass through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and en- 
ter the cerebellum, having their origin on the same side of

the brainstem and spinal cord (see Figure 19.3A). This ar- 
rangement ensures that the right cerebellum is concerned 
with the right half of the body and the left cerebellum with 
the left half. Thus, while the cerebrum is generally con- 
cerned with contralateral representation (of the body and 
external space), the cerebellum is concerned with ipsilateral 
representation. 
Finally, the entire cerebellum receives modulatory inputs 
from the inferior olivary nucleus (or inferior olive) in the 
brainstem, which participates in the learning and memory 
functions served by cerebellar circuitry. The inferior olive 
receives input from a wide variety of structures includ- 
ing the cerebral cortex (via a relay in the parvocellular, or 
"small-celled," division of the red nucleus), the reticular 
formation, and the spinal cord. The so-called olivo-cere- 
bellar axons exit medially from the inferior olive, cross the 
midline, and enter the cerebellum on the opposite side via 
the inferior cerebellar peduncle (see Figure 19.3A). Elec- 
trotonic gap junctions are abundant among neurons in the 
inferior olive, and these evidently play an important role in 
the timing of responses in the cerebellum. 
Projections from the Cerebellum 
The efferent neurons of the cerebellar cortex project to 
the deep cerebellar nuclei and to the vestibular complex; 
these structures project, in turn, to upper motor neurons in 
the brainstem and to thalamic nuclei that innervate upper 
motor neurons in the motor cortex (Figure 19.5). In each 
cerebellar hemisphere, there are four major deep nuclei: 
the dentate nucleus (by far the largest in humans), two

interposed nuclei, and the fastigial nucleus. Each receives 
input from a different region of the cerebellar cortex. Al- 
though the borders are not distinct, in general the cerebro- 
cerebellum projects primarily to the dentate nucleus, and 
the spinocerebellum to the interposed and fastigial nuclei. 
The vestibulocerebellum projects directly to the vestibular 
complex in the brainstem. As discussed in Chapter 17, parts 
of the vestibular complex are sources of upper motor neu- 
rons that influence posture, equilibrium, and vestibulocular 
eye movements. 
Cerebrocerebellar pathways from the dentate nucleus 
project primarily to the premotor and associational cortices 
of the frontal lobe, which function in planning volitional 
movements. The pathways reach these cortical areas after a 
relay in the ventral nuclear complex in the thalamus (Figure 
19.6A). Since each cerebellar hemisphere is concerned with 
the ipsilateral side of the body, this pathway must cross 
the midline if the motor cortex in each hemisphere, which 
governs contralateral musculature, is to receive informa- 
tion from the appropriate cerebellar hemisphere. For this 
reason, the dentate axons that exit the cerebellum via the 
superior cerebellar peduncle cross at the decussation of 
the superior cerebellar peduncle in the caudal midbrain, 
and then ascend to the contralateral thalamus. Along its 
course to the thalamus, this pathway sends collaterals to the 
parvocellular division of the red nucleus in the midbrain 
(which accounts for virtually the entire red nucleus in the 
human midbrain) (Figure 19.6B). This division of the red 
nucleus projects, in turn, to the inferior olive, thus providing

a means for cerebellar output to feed back upon a major 
source of cerebellar input. This feedback is crucial for the 
adaptive functions of cerebellar circuits (see below). 
In addition to ascending projections concerned with the 
control of movement, anatomical studies using viruses to 
trace chains of connections between nerve cells have shown 
that large parts of the cerebrocerebellum send informa- 
tion back to non-motor areas of the cortex to form "closed 
loops." Thatis, a region of the cerebellum sends projections 
back to the same cortical areas (via thalamic projections) 
from which its input signals originated. Such closed loop 
cerebellar circuits provide a mechanism for the cerebellum 
to modulate its input. In the case of cerebellar circuits that 
modulate the prefrontal cortex, these closed loops may also 
influence the coordination of non-motor programs—such 
as problem-solving—in a manner that is analogous to their 
modulation of movement-related signals. The closed loops 
run in parallel to "open loops" that receive input from mul- 
tiple cortical areas and funnel output back to upper mo- 
tor neurons in specific regions of the motor and premotor 
cortices.

Spinocerebellar pathways are directed toward circuits of 
upper motor neurons that govern the execution of move- 
ment. The somatotopic organization of this division of the 
cerebellum is reflected in the organization of its efferent 
projections, both of which conform to the medial—lateral 
organization of motor control in the spinal cord (see Chap- 
ter 16). Thus, the fastigial nuclei (which underlie the vermis 
near the midline of the cerebellum) project via the inferior 
cerebellar peduncle to nuclei of the reticular formation and 
vestibular complex that give rise to medial tracts governing 
the axial and proximal limb musculature (Figure 19.7). The 
more laterally positioned interposed nuclei (which underlie 
the paramedian subdivision of the spinocerebellum) project 
via the superior cerebellar peduncle to thalamic circuits that 
interact with motor regions in the frontal lobe concerned 
with volitional movements of the limbs (see Figure 19.6).

In non-human primates, axons from the interposed nuclei 
also send collaterals to a magnocellular (large-celled) divi- 
sion of the red nucleus that gives rise to the rubrospinal 
tract, a lateral tract of the spinal cord that functions syner- 
gistically with the lateral corticospinal tract. (As discussed 
in Chapter 17, this division of the red nucleus and its spinal 
projection is vestigial in humans relative to other primates.) 
Most of the projection from the cerebellum to the up- 
per motor neurons in the superior colliculus arises in the 
dentate and interposed nuclei, which receive their input 
from the lateral portions of the cerebellar cortex. The out- 
put pathway travels in the superior cerebellar peduncle and 
crosses the midline to terminate on upper motor neurons in 
the deep layers of the superior colliculus on the contralat- 
eral side. So, for example, the right cerebellar hemisphere 
projects to the left superior colliculus, which in turn con- 
trols saccades toward the right half of the visual field (see 
Chapter 20). 
The thalamic nuclei that receive projections from the 
cerebrocerebellum (dentate nuclei) and spinocerebellum 
(interposed nuclei) are segregated in two distinct subdi- 
visions of the ventral lateral nuclear complex: the oral, or

anterior, part of the posterolateral segment, and a region 
simply called "area X." Both of these thalamic relays project 
directly to primary motor and premotor association cortices. 
_ Thus, the cerebellum has access to the upper motor neu- 
rons that organize the sequence of muscular contractions 
underlying complex voluntary movements, as well as to as- 
sociational circuits that exert executive control over move- 
ment (see Chapter 17). 
Lastly, projections from the vestibulocerebellum course 
through the inferior cerebellar peduncle and terminate in 
nuclei of the vestibular complex in the brainstem that gov- 
ern the movements of the eyes, head, and neck, compen- 
sating for linear and rotational accelerations of the head 
(see Figure 19.5). 
Circuits within the Cerebellum 
The ultimate destination of the afferent pathways to the 
cerebellar cortex is a distinctive cell type called the Purkinje 
cell (see Figures 19.8 and 19.9). However, the input from 
the cerebral cortex to the Purkinje cells is indirect. Neurons 
in the pontine nuclei receive a massive projection from the 
cerebral cortex and relay the information to the contralateral 
cerebellar cortex. The axons from the pontine nuclei—and 
most other sources of cerebellar input in the brainstem and 
spinal cord—are called mossy fibers because of the appear- 
ance of their synaptic terminals. Mossy fibers synapse on 
neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei and on granule cells 
in the granule cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. Cerebellar 
granule cells are widely held to be the most abundant class 
of neurons in the human brain; they give rise to axons called 
parallel fibers that ascend to the molecular layer of the cer- 
ebellar cortex. The parallel fibers bifurcate in the molecular 
layer to form T-shaped branches that extend for several mil- 
limeters parallel to the orientation of the small cerebellar

gyri (called folia); there, they form excitatory synapses with 
the dendritic spines of Purkinje cells. 
The Purkinje cells (Figure 19.8A) present the most 
striking histological feature of the cerebellum. Elaborate 
dendrites extend into the molecular layer from a single 
subjacent layer of these giant nerve cell bodies (called the 
Purkinje layer; Figure 19.8B). Once in the molecular layer, 
the Purkinje cell dendrites branch extensively in a plane at 
right angles to the trajectory of the parallel fibers (Figure 
19.9A). In this way, each Purkinje cell is in a position to 
receive input from a large number of parallel fibers (about 
200,000), and each parallel fiber can contact a very large 
number of Purkinje cells (on the order of tens of thou- 
sands). The Purkinje cells also receive a direct modulatory 
input on their dendritic shafts from the climbing fibers, 
all of which arise in the inferior olive (Figure 19.9B). Each 
Purkinje cell receives numerous synaptic contacts from a 
single climbing fiber. The climbing fibers provide a "train- 
ing" signal that modulates the effectiveness of the parallel 
fiber connection with the Purkinje cells (see below).

a "cortical inhibitory loop" that inverts the

ron output to the deep cerebellar nuclear

that can modify movements. The climbing 
fibers modify the efficacy of the parallel 
fiber—Purkinje cell connection, producing 
long-term changes in cerebellar output. (A

The Purkinje cells project in turn to the deep cerebel- 
lar nuclei. They are the only output cells of the cerebel- 
lar cortex. Since Purkinje cells are GABAergic, the output 
of the cerebellar cortex is wholly inhibitory. However, the 
neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei also receive excitatory 
input from the collaterals of the mossy and climbing fibers. 
The inhibitory projections of Purkinje cells serve to shape 
the discharge patterns that deep nuclei neurons generate 
in response to this direct mossy and climbing fiber input 
(Figure 19.10). 
Inputs from local circuit neurons modulate the inhibitory 
activity of Purkinje cells. The most powerful of these local 
inputs are inhibitory nests of synapses made with the Pur- 
kinje cell bodies by basket cells (see Figure 19.9). Another 
type of local circuit neuron, the stellate cell, receives input 
from the parallel fibers and provides an inhibitory input 
to the Purkinje cell dendrites. Finally, the molecular layer 
contains the apical dendrites of a cell type called Golgi 
cells; these neurons have their cell bodies in the granular 
cell layer. Golgi cells receive input from the parallel fibers

and provide an inhibitory feedback to the cells of origin of 
the parallel fibers (the granule cells). 
This basic circuit is repeated over and over throughout 
every subdivision of the cerebellum in all mammals; it is the 
fundamental functional module of the cerebellum. Trans- 
formation of signal flow through these modules provides 
the basis for both the real-time regulation of movement 
and the long-term changes in regulation that underlie mo- 
tor learning. Description of the flow of signals through this 
admittedly complex intrinsic circuitry may be simplified by 
distinguishing the two basic stages of cerebellar process- 
ing, beginning with the deep cerebellar nuclei. Mossy fiber 
and climbing fiber collaterals drive the activation of neurons 
in the deep cerebellar nuclei; this constitutes an excitatory 
loop where input signals converge on the output stage of 
cerebellar processing. However, as suggested above, the 
spatiotemporal patterns of the output activity are not sim- 
ply faithful replications of the input patterns. The activity 
patterns of the deep cerebellar nuclei are sculpted by the 
descending inhibitory inputs of Purkinje cells, which are 
driven by these same two pathways (i.e., the mossy and 
climbing fiber projections to the cerebellar cortex). For their 
part, Purkinje cells integrate these principal inputs and in- 
vert their "sign" by responding to excitatory drive with an 
inhibitory output (see Figure 19.10B). Thus, Purkinje cells 
convey the product of computations performed by an in- 
hibitory loop that comprises the circuitry of the cerebellar 
cortex, including the interneurons of the granule and mo- 
lecular layers, as well as the Purkinje cells themselves. The 
Golgi, stellate, and basket cells control the flow of informa- 
tion through the cerebellar cortex. For example, the Golgi 
cells form an inhibitory feedback circuit that controls the 
gain of the granule cell input to the Purkinje cells, whereas 
the basket cells provide lateral inhibition that may focus the 
spatial distribution of Purkinje cell activity. 
The modulation of cerebellar output by the cerebellar 
cortex may be responsible for the motor learning. Accord- 
ing to a model proposed by Masao Ito and his colleagues at 
Tokyo University, the climbing fibers relay the message of 
a motor error to the Purkinje cells. This message is derived 
from inputs that the inferior olive receives from multiple 
structures (including the cerebral cortex and spinal cord) 
as well as from feedback signals from the cerebellum via 
the red nucleus, as discussed above. The thousand or so 
synapses made by a single climbing fiber with the proximal 
dendrites of a single Purkinje cell constitutes one of the 
most powerful excitatory connections in the entire central 
nervous system. The strength of this input is further en- 
hanced by the gap junctions that electronically join and 
synchronize the activity of the neurons in the inferior ol- 
ive. Thus, ensembles of olivary neurons can simultaneously 
both drive the activation of cerebellar circuits and promote 
adaptive plasticity in the inhibitory output of the cerebellar 
cortex. This plasticity results from long-term reductions in 
Purkinje cell responses to parallel fiber inputs through a 
complex chain of events leading from the climbing fiber 
input to'the Purkinje cells to the endocytosis of AMPA 
receptors at parallel fiber—Purkinje cell synapses. (Recall 
that AMPA receptors mediated fast, excitatory responses 
at glutamatergic synapses; for an account of the cellular 
mechanisms responsible for this long-term reduction in 
the efficacy of the parallel fiber synapse on Purkinje cells, 
see Chapter 8.) 
The reduction in the efficacy of parallel fiber input to 
Purkinje cells has the effect of increasing the response of 
neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei to afferent activity 
(by weakening the influence of the inhibitory loop). Thus, 
the feedback signals from the cerebellum to circuits of up- 
per motor neurons in the motor cortex and brainstem are 
altered as a consequence of climbing fiber activation. It is 
'not yet understood at the circuit level how this alteration 
mediates a "correction" of movement error. Nevertheless, 
it is clear from studies of animal models and of human pa- 
tients with damage to the inferior olive that both short-term 
sensorimotor adaptation (error correction) and long-term 
motor learning require the modulation of cerebellar pro- 
cessing by climbing fiber activation. 
Cerebellar Circuitry and the 
Coordination of Ongoing Movement 
As expected for a structure that monitors and adjusts motor 
behavior, neuronal activity in the cerebellum changes con- 
tinually during the course of a movement. For instance, the 
execution of a relatively simple task such as flipping the wrist 
back and forth elicits a dynamic pattern of activity in both 
the Purkinje cells and the deep cerebellar nuclear cells that 
closely follows the ongoing movement (Figure 19.11). Both 
types of cells are tonically active at rest and change their fre- 
quency of firing as movements occur. The neurons respond 
selectively to various aspects of movement, including relax- 
ation or contraction of specific muscles, the position of the 
joints, and the-direction of the next movement that will occur. 
All this information is encoded by changes in the discharge 
pattern of Purkinje cells; such changes modulate the ongoing 
output of the deep cerebellar nuclear cells. 
As these neuronal response properties predict, cerebel- 
lar lesions and disease tend to disrupt the modulation and 
coordination of ongoing movements (Box 19A). Thus, 
the hallmark of patients with cerebellar damage is diffi- 
culty producing smooth, well-coordinated, multi-jointed 
movements. Instead, movements tend to be decomposed 
into jerky and imprecise actions, a condition referred to as 
cerebellar ataxia. Many of these difficulties in perform- 
ing movements can be explained as disruption of the cer- 
ebellum's role in correcting errors in ongoing movements,

BOX 19A Prion Diseases 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is 
a rare but devastating neurological 
disorder characterized by cerebellar 
ataxia, myoclonic jerks, seizures, and 
the fulminant progression of dementia. 
The onset is usually in middle age, and 
death typically follows within a year. 
The distinctive histopathology of the 
disease, termed spongiform degeneration, 
consists of neuron loss and extensive 
glial proliferation, mainly in the cortex 
of the cerebellum and cerebrum; the 
peculiar spongiform pattern is due to 
vacuoles in the cytoplasm of neurons 
and glia. CJD is the only human disease 
known to be transmitted by inoculation 
(either orally or into the bloodstream), 
or to be inherited through the germline. 
In contrast to other transmissible dis- 
eases mediated by microorganisms such 
as viruses or bacteria, the agent in this 
case is a protein called a prion. 
Observations dating back some 40 
years suggested that CJD was infective. 
The major clue came from scrapie, a 
once-obscure disease of sheep that is 
also characterized by cerebellar ataxia, 
wasting, and intense itching. The ability 
to transmit scrapie from one sheep to 
another strongly suggested an infec- 
tious agent. Another clue came from 
the work of Carlton Gajdusek, a neurol- 
ogist studying a peculiar human disease 
called kuru that occurred specifically in 
a group of New Guinea natives known 
to practice ritual cannibalism. Like CJD, 
kuru is a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by devastating cerebellar 
ataxia and subsequent dementia, usu- 
ally leading to death within a year. The 
striking similarities in the distinctive 
histopathology of scrapie and kuru— 
namely, spongiform degeneration— 
suggested a common pathogenesis 
and led to the successful transmission 
of kuru to apes and chimpanzees in 
the 1960s, confirming that CJD was 
indeed infectious. The prolonged period 
(months to years) between inoculation 
and disease onset led Gajdusek to sug- 
gest that the transmissible agent was 
what he called a "slow virus." 
These extraordinary findings spurred 
an intensive search for the infectious 
agent. The transmission of scrapie 
from sheep to hamsters by Stanley 
Prusiner at the University of California, 
San Francisco permitted biochemical 
characterization of partially purified 
fractions of scrapie agent from hamster 
brain. Oddly, he found that the infectiv- 
ity was extraordinarily resistant to ultra- 
violet irradiation or nucleases—both 
treatments that degrade nucleic acids. 
It therefore seemed unlikely that a virus 
could be the causal agent. Conversely, 
procedures that modified or degraded 
proteins markedly diminished infectiv- 
ity. In 1982, Prusiner coined the term 
prion to refer to the agent causing these 
transmissible spongiform encephalopa- 
thies. He chose the term to emphasize 
that the agent was a proteinaceous 
infectious particle (and made the abbre- 
viation a little more euphonious in the 
process). Since Prusiner's discoveries, 
a half-dozen more animal diseases— 
including the widely publicized bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or 
"mad cow disease"—and four more 
human diseases have been shown to be 
caused by prions. 
(Continued on next page) 

428 
CHAPTER 19 
| BOX 19A (continued) 
__ 
Whether prions contain undetected 
- nucleic acids or are really proteins 
- remained controversial for some years. 
_ Prusiner strongly advocated a "protein- 
_ only" hypothesis, a revolutionary 
_ concept with respect to transmissible 
_ diseases. He proposed that the prion 
_ is a protein consisting of a modified 
_ (scrapie) form (PrP*) of the normal 
_ host protein (PrPS, for "prion protein 
control"), the propagation of which 
occurs by a conformational change of 
endogenous PrP to PrP* autocatalyzed 
_ by PrP**. That is, the modified form of 
_ the protein (PrP*') transforms the nor- 
- mal form (PrP°) into the modified form, 
much as crystals form in supersaturated 
solutions. Differences in the second- 
ary structures of PrP© and PrP** seen 
_ with optical spectroscopy supported 
this idea. An alternative hypothesis, 
_ however, was that the agent is simply 
an unconventional nucleic acids-con- 
_ taining virus and that the accumulation 
_ of PrP®* is an incidental consequence of 
infection and cell death. 
_ 
In the past decade, a compelling 
body of evidence in support of the 
"protein-only" hypothesis has emerged. 
_ First, PrP® and scrapie infectivity co- 
purify by a number of procedures, 
including affinity chromatography 
using an anti-PrP monoclonal antibody; 
no nucleic acid has been detected in 
highly purified preparations, despite 
intensive efforts. Second, spongiform 
encephalopathies can be inherited in 
humans, and the cause is now known 
to be a mutation (or mutations) in 
the gene coding for PrP. Third, trans- 
genic mice carrying a mutant PrP gene 
equivalent to one of the mutations of 
inherited human prion disease develop 
a spongiform encephalopathy. Thus, a 
defective protein is sufficient to account 
for the disease. Finally, transgenic mice 
carrying a null mutation for PrP do not 
develop spongiform encephalopathy 
when inoculated with scrapie agent, 
whereas wild-type mice do. These 
results argue convincingly that PrP® 
must indeed interact with endogenous 
PrP° to convert PrP© to PrP**, propagat- 
ing the disease in the process. The pro- 
tein is highly conserved across mam- 
malian species, suggesting that it serves 
some essential function, although mice 
carrying a null mutation of PrP exhibit 
no detectable abnormalities. 
These advances notwithstanding, 
many questions remain. What is the 
mechanism by which the conformational 
transformation of PrP© to PrP* occurs? 
How do mutations at different sites 
of the same protein culminate in the 
| 
distinct phenotypes evident in diverse 
prion diseases of humans? Are confor- 
mational changes of proteins a common 
mechanism of other neurodegenerative 
diseases? And do these findings suggest 
a therapy for the dreadful manifestations 
of spongiform encephalopathies? 
Despite these unanswered ques- 
tions, this work, which represents one 
of the most exciting chapters in modern 
neurological research, won a Nobel 
Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 
both Gajdusek (in 1976) and Prusiner 
(in 1997).

since the cerebellar error correction mechanism normally 
ensures that movements are modified to cope with chang- 
ing circumstances. As described earlier, the Purkinje cells 
and deep cerebellar nuclear cells recognize potential er- 
rors by comparing patterns of convergent activity that are 
concurrently available to both cell types. The deep nuclear 
cells then send corrective signals to the upper motor neu- 
rons in order to maintain or improve the accuracy of the 
movement. 
As in the case of the basal ganglia, studies of the ocu- 
lomotor system (saccades in particular) have contributed 
greatly to understanding the contribution that the cerebel- 
lum makes to motor error reduction. For example, cutting 
part of the tendon to the lateral rectus muscles in one eye of 
a monkey weakens horizontal eye movements by that eye 
(Figure 19.12). When a patch is then placed over the normal 
eye to force the animal to use its weak eye, the saccades 
performed by the weak eye are initially hypometric—they 
fall short of visual targets. Over the next few days, the am- 
plitude of the saccades gradually increases until they again 
become accurate. If the patch is then switched to cover the 
weakened eye, the saccades performed by the normal eye 
are now hypermetric. In other words, over a period of a few 
days the nervous system corrects the errors in the saccades 
made by the weak eye by increasing the gain in the saccade 
motor system (see Chapter 20). Lesions in the vermis of the 
spinocerebellum (see Figure 19.1) eliminate this ability to 
reduce the motor error. 
Similar evidence of the cerebellar contribution to move- 
ment has come from studies of the vestibulo-ocular reflex 
(VOR) in monkeys and humans. The VOR keeps the eyes 
trained on a visual target during head movements (see

Chapter 14). The relative simplicity of this reflex has made 
it possible to analyze some of the mechanisms that en- 
able motor learning as a process of error reduction. When 
the head moves, the eyes must move at the same velocity 
in the opposite direction to maintain a stable representa- 
tion of the visual image on the retina. In these studies, the 
adaptability of the VOR to changes in the nature of incom- 
ing sensory information is challenged by fitting subjects 
(either monkeys or humans) with magnifying or minify- 
ing spectacles (Figure 19.13). Because the glasses alter the 
size of the visual image on the retina, the compensatory 
eye movements, which would normally have maintained a 
stable image of an object on the retina, are either too large 
or too small. Over time, subjects (whether monkeys or 
humans) learn to adjust the distance the eyes must move 
in response to head movements to accord with the artifi- 
cially altered size of the visual field. Moreover, this change 
is retained for significant periods after the spectacles are 
removed and can be detected electrophysiologically in re- 
cordings from Purkinje cells and neurons in the deep cer- 
ebellar nuclei. Once again, if the cerebellum is damaged or

to undershoot the target (1). When the experimen- 
tal subject (in this case a monkey) is forced to use 
this eye by patching the right eye, multiple sac- 
cades must be generated to acquire the target (2). 
After 5 days of experience with the weak eye, the 
gain of the saccadic system has been increased, 
and a single saccade is now used to fixate the tar- 
get. (3) This adjustment of the gain of the saccadic

removed, the ability of the VOR to adapt to the new con- 
ditions is lost. These observations support the conclusion 
that the cerebellum is critically important in error reduction 
during motor learning. 
Further Consequences of 
Cerebellar Lesions 
We have seen that patients with cerebellar damage, re- 
gardless of the cause or location, exhibit persistent errors 
in movement. These movement errors are always on the 
same side of the body as the damage to the cerebellum, re- 
flecting the cerebellum's unusual status as a brain structure 
in which sensory and motor information is represented ip- 
silaterally rather than contralaterally. Furthermore, somatic, 
visual, and other inputs are represented topographically 
within the cerebellum; as a result, the movement deficits 
following circumscribed cerebellar damage may be quite 
specific. For example, one of the most common cerebellar 
syndromes is caused by degeneration in the anterior por- 
tion of the cerebellar cortex in patients with a long history

Learned changes in the vestibulo-ocular

When the animal observes the world through minifying specta-

er, the gain of the VOR is reset and the eyes move an appropriate

of alcohol abuse (Figure 19.14). Such damage specifically 
affects movement in the lower limbs, which are represented 
in the anterior spinocerebellum (see Figure 19.4). The con- 
sequences include a wide and staggering gait, but with 
little impairment of arm or hand movements. Thus, the 
topographical organization of the cerebellum allows cer- 
ebellar damage to disrupt the coordination of movements 
performed by some muscle groups but not others. 
The implication of these pathologies is that the cerebel- 
lum is normally capable of integrating the moment-to-mo- 
ment actions of muscles and joints throughout the body 
to ensure the smooth execution of a full range of motor 
behaviors. Thus, cerebellar lesions lead first and foremost 
to a lack of coordination of ongoing movements (Box 19B). 
For example, damage to the vestibulocerebellum impairs 
the ability to stand upright and maintain the direction of 
gaze. The eyes have difficulty maintaining fixation; they 
drift from the target and then jump back to it with a correc- 
tive saccade, a phenomenon called nystagmus. Disruption 
of the pathways to the vestibular nuclei may also result in

a reduction of muscle tone. In contrast, patients with dam- 
age to the spinocerebellum have difficulty controlling walk- 
ing movements; they have a wide-based gait with small 
shuffling movements, which represents the inappropriate 
operation of groups of muscles that normally rely on sen- 
sory feedback to produce smooth, concerted actions. The 
patients also have difficulty performing rapid alternating 
movements, a sign referred to as dysdiadochokinesia. 
Over- and underreaching, or dysmetria, may also oc- 
cur. Tremors, known as action or intention tremors, ac- 
company over- and undershooting of a movement due to 
disruption of the mechanism for detecting and correcting 
movement errors. Finally, lesions of the cerebrocerebellum 
produce impairments in highly skilled sequences of learned 
movements, such as speech or playing a musical instru- 
ment. The common denominator of all of these signs, re- 
gardless of the site of the lesion, is the inability to perform 
smooth, precisely directed movements.

Pathological changes can provide insights about 
cerebellar function. In this example, chronic alcohol abuse has caused 
degeneration of the anterior vermis (arrows), while leaving other cerebel- 
lar regions intact. The patient had difficulty walking but little impairment 
of arm movements or speech. The orientation of this paramedian sagittal 
section is the same as Figure 19.1D. (From Victor et al., 1959.)

Genetic Analysis of Cerebellar Function 
| Since the early 1950s, investigators 
_ interested in motor behavior have 
_ identified and studied strains of mutant 
_ mice in which movement is compro- 
_ mised. These mutant mice are easy to 
_ spot: following induced or spontaneous 
| mutagenesis, the "screen" is simply 
_ to look for animals that have difficulty 
| moving. 
Genetic analysis suggested that 
_ some of these abnormal behaviors 
_ could be explained by single autoso- 
mal recessive or semidominant muta- 
tions, in which homozygotes are most 
_ severely affected. The strains were 
given names like reeler, weaver, lurcher, 
staggerer, and leaner that reflected the 
nature of the motor dysfunction they 
exhibited (see table). The relatively 
large number of mutations that com- 
promise movement suggested it might 
be possible to understand some aspects 
_ of motor circuits and function at the 
genetic level. 
A common feature of the mutants 
is ataxia resembling that associated 
with cerebellar dysfunction in humans. 
Motor Mutations in Mice 
MODULATION OF MOVEMENT BY THE CEREBELLUM 
431 
Indeed, all the mutations are associated 
with some form of cerebellar pathol- 
ogy. The pathologies associated with 
the reeler and weaver mutations are 
particularly striking. In the reeler cer- 
ebellum, Purkinje cells, granule cells, 
and interneurons are all displaced from 
their usual laminar positions, and there 
are fewer granule cells than normal. In 
weaver, most of the granule cells are 
lost prior to their migration from the 
external granule layer (a proliferative 
region where cerebellar granule cells 
are generated during development), 
leaving only Purkinje cells and local 
interneurons to carry on the work of 
the cerebellum. Thus, these mutations 
causing deficits in motor behavior 
impair the development and final dis- 
position of the neurons that comprise 
the major processing circuits of the cer- 
ebellum (see Figures-19.8 and 19.9). 
Efforts to characterize the cellular 
mechanisms underlying these motor 
deficits were unsuccessful, and the 
molecular identity of the affected genes 
remained obscure until recently. In the 
past few years, however, both the reeler 
and weaver genes have been identified 
and cloned. 
The reeler gene was cloned through 
a combination of good luck and careful 
observation. In the course of making 
transgenic mice by inserting DNA frag- 
ments in the mouse genome, investiga- 
tors in Tom Curran's laboratory created 
a new strain of mice that behaved much | 
like reeler mice and had similar cerebel- 
lar pathology. This "synthetic" reeler 
mutation was identified by finding 
the position of the novel DNA frag- 
ment—which turned out to be on the 
same chromosome as the original reeler 
mutation. Further analysis showed that 
the same gene had indeed been mutat- 
ed, and the reeler gene was subsequent- 
ly identified. Remarkably, the protein 
encoded by this gene is homologous 
to known extracellular matrix proteins 
such as tenascin, laminin, and fibronec- 
tin (see Chapter 23). This finding makes 
good sense, since the pathophysiology 
of the reeler mutation entails altered cell

Summary 
The cerebellum receives input from regions of the cerebral 
cortex that plan and initiate complex and highly skilled 
movements; it also receives input from sensory systems 
that monitor the course of movements. This arrangement 
enables a comparison of an intended movement with the 
actual movement and a reduction in the difference, or "mo- 
tor error." The corrections of motor error produced by the 
cerebellum occur in real time and are stored over longer pe- 
riods as a form of motor learning. Error correction is medi- 
ated by climbing fibers that ascend from the inferior olive 
to contact the dendrites of the Purkinje cells in the cere- 
bellar cortex. Information provided by the climbing fibers 
modulates the effectiveness of the second major input to 
the Purkinje cells, which arrives via the parallel fibers from 
the granule cells. The granule cells receive information about 
the intended movement—and the actual performance of the 
movement—from the vast number of mossy fibers that enter 
the cerebellum from multiple sources. As might be expected, 
the output of the cerebellum from the deep cerebellar nuclei 
projects to circuits that govern all the major sources of up- 
per motor neurons described in Chapter 17. The effects of 
cerebellar disease provide strong support for the idea that 
the cerebellum regulates the performance of movements. 
Thus, patients with cerebellar disorders show severe atax- 
ias in which the site of the lesion determines the particular 
movements affected, with incoordination of movement on 
the same side of the body as the site of the lesion.

Eye MOVEMENTS 
AND SENSORY Motor 
INTEGRATION 
Overview 
EYE MOVEMENTS ARE IN MANY WAYS easier to study than movements of other 
parts of the body. This fact arises in part from the relative simplicity of muscle actions 
on the eyeball. There are only six extraocular muscles, each of which has a specific 
role in adjusting eye position. Moreover, there is a limited set of stereotyped eye 
movements, each with its own control circuitry. Eye movements have therefore been 
a useful model for understanding the mechanisms of motor control. Indeed, much of 
what is known about the regulation of movements by the cerebellum, basal ganglia, 
and vestibular system has come from the study of eye movements (see Chapters 14, 
18, and 19). In this chapter, the major features of eye movement control are used 
to illustrate principles of sensory motor integration that also apply to more complex 
motor behaviors. 
What Eye Movements Accomplish 
Eye movements are important in humans because high visual acuity is restricted to 
the fovea, the small circular region (about 1.2 mm in diameter) in the central retina 
that is densely packed with cone photoreceptors (see Chapter 11). Eye movements 
can direct the fovea to new objects of interest—a process called foveation—or com- 
pensate for disturbances that cause the fovea to be displaced from a target already 
being foveated. 
Several decades ago, the Russian physiologist Alfred Yarbus demonstrated that 
eye movements reveal a good deal about the strategies used to inspect a scene. Yar- 
bus used contact lenses with small mirrors on them to document (by the position 
of a reflected beam) the pattern of eye movements made while subjects examined a 
variety of objects and scenes. Figure 20.1 shows the changes in the direction of a sub- 
ject's gaze while viewing a photograph. The thin, straight lines represent the quick, 
ballistic eye movements (saccades) used to align the foveas with particular parts of 
the scene. Little or no visual perception occurs during a saccade, which occupies only 
a few tens of milliseconds. The denser spots along these lines represent points of 
fixation where the observer paused for a variable period to take in visual information. 
The results obtained by Yarbus, and subsequently by many others, showed that vision

CHAPTER 20 
Figure 20.1 
Eye movements of a subject viewing a 
photograph. The subject was shown this photograph (left) of 
the famous bust of Queen Nefertiti; the diagram on the right 
shows the subject's eye movements over a 2-minute viewing 
period. (From Yarbus, 1967.) 
is an active process in which eye movements typically shift 
the view several times each second to selected parts of the 
scene to examine especially interesting features. The spatial 
distribution of the fixation points indicates that the subject 
spent much more time scrutinizing Nefertiti's eye, nose, 
mouth, and ear than examining the middle of her cheek or 
neck. Thus, eye movements allow us to scan the visual field, 
pausing to focus attention on the portions of the scene that 
convey the most significant information. As is apparent in 
Figure 20.1, tracking eye movements can be used to deter- 
mine which aspects of a scene are particularly arresting; in 
fact, today's corporate advertisers can use modern versions 
of Yarbus's method to determine which pictures and scene 
arrangements will best sell their products. 
The importance of eye movements for visual percep- 
tion has also been demonstrated by experiments in which 
a visual image is stabilized on the retina, either by para- 
lyzing the extraocular eye muscles or by moving a scene 
in exact register with eye movements so that the different 
features of the image always fall on exactly the same parts 
of the retina (Box 20A). Such stabilized visual images rap- 
idly disappear, for reasons that remain poorly understood. 
Nonetheless, observations on motionless images make it 
plain that eye movements are essential for normal visual 
perception. 
The Actions and Innervation 
of Extraocular Muscles 
Three antagonistic pairs of muscles control eye movements: 
the lateral and medial rectus muscles; the superior and 
inferior rectus muscles; and the superior and inferior 
oblique muscles. These muscles are responsible for move- 
- ments of the eye along three different axes: horizontal, either 
toward the nose (adduction) or away from the nose (abduc- 
tion); vertical, either elevation or depression; and torsional, 
movements that bring the top of the eye toward the nose 
(intorsion) or away from the nose (extorsion). Horizontal 
movements are controlled entirely by the medial and lateral 
rectus muscles; the medial rectus muscle is responsible for 
adduction, the lateral rectus muscle for abduction (Figure 
20.2). Vertical movements require the coordinated action 
of the superior and inferior rectus muscles, as well as the 
oblique muscles. The relative contribution of the rectus and 
oblique groups depends on the horizontal position of the 
eye. In the primary position (eyes straight ahead), both of 
these groups contribute to vertical movements. Elevation is 
due to the action of the superior rectus and inferior oblique 
muscles, while depression is due to the action of the infe- 
rior rectus and superior oblique muscles. When the eye is 
abducted, the rectus muscles are the prime vertical movers; 
elevation is due to the action of the superior rectus, and de- 
pression is due to the action of the inferior rectus. When the 
eye is adducted, the oblique muscles are the prime vertical

The six pairs of extraocular 
muscles contribute to vertical and hori- 
zontal eye movements. Horizontal move-

rectus muscles, while vertical movements are

and the superior and inferior oblique muscle

Visual perception depends critically on 
frequent changes of scene. Normally, 
our view of the world is changed by 
_ 
saccades, and tiny saccades that con- 
tinue to move the eyes abruptly over a 
fraction of a degree of visual arc occur 
_ even when the observer stares intently 
at an object of interest. Moreover, con- 
tinual drift of the eyes during fixation 
progressively shifts the image onto a 
nearby but different set of photorecep- 
tors. As a consequence of these several 
_ 
sorts of eye movements (Figure A), 
our point of view changes more or less 
continually. 
The importance of a continually 
changing scene for normal vision is 
dramatically revealed when the retinal 
image is stabilized. If a small mirror 
is attached to the eye by means of a 
contact lens and an image reflected 
off the mirror onto a screen, then 
the subject necessarily sees the same 
thing, whatever the position of the 
eye—every time the eye moves, the 
projected image moves by exactly the 
same amount (Figure B). Under these 
circumstances, the stabilized image 
actually disappears from perception 
within a few seconds! 
A simple way to demonstrate the 
rapid disappearance of a stabilized 
retinal image is to visualize one's own 
retinal blood vessels. The blood vessels, 
which lie in front of the photoreceptor 
layer, cast a shadow on the underlying 
receptors. Although normally invis- 
ible, the vascular shadows can be seen 
by moving a source of light across the 
eye, a phenomenon first noted by J. E. 
Purkinje more than 150 years ago. This 
perception can be elicited with an ordi- 
nary penlight pressed gently against the 
lateral side of the closed eyelid. When 
the light is wiggled vigorously, a rich 
network of black blood vessel shad- 
ows (called a "Purkinje tree") appears 
against an orange background. (The 
vessels appear black because they are 
shadows.) By starting and stopping the 
movement, it is readily apparent that 
the image of the blood vessel shadows 
disappears within a fraction of a second 
after the light source is stilled.

ments that continually change the retinal 
stimulus during fixation. The straight lines 
indicate microsaccades, and the zigzag 
lines drift; the structures in the back- 
ground are photoreceptor cells drawn 
approximately to scale. The normal scan- 
ning movements of the eyes (saccades) 
are much too large to be shown here but 
obviously contribute to the changes of 
view that we continually experience, as do 
slow tracking eye movements (although 
the fovea tracks a particular object, 
the scene nonetheless changes). (After 
Pritchard, 1961.) 
The conventional interpretation of 
the rapid disappearance of stabilized 
images is retinal adaptation. In fact, the 
phenomenon is at least partly of central 
origin. Stabilizing the retinal image in 
one eye, for example, diminishes per- 
ception through the other eye, an effect 
known as interocular transfer. Although 
the explanation of these remarkable 
effects is not entirely clear, they empha- 
size the point that the visual system is 
designed to deal with novelty.

movers. In this position, elevation is due to the action of 
the inferior oblique muscle, while depression is due to the 
action of the superior oblique muscle. The oblique muscles 
are also primarily responsible for torsional movements. 
The extraocular muscles are innervated by lower motor 
neurons whose axons form three cranial nerves: the ab- 
ducens, the trochlear, and the oculomotor (Figure 20.3). 
The abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) exits the brainstem 
from the pons—medullary junction and innervates the lat- 
eral rectus muscle. The trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV) 
exits from the caudal portion of the midbrain and supplies 
the superior oblique muscle. Distinct from all other cranial 
nerves, the trochlear nerve exits from the dorsal surface of

superior rectus, and inferior oblique). 
the brainstem and crosses the midline to innervate the su- 
perior oblique muscle on the contralateral side (this is the 
only somatic motor nerve that supplies muscles on the op- 
posite side of the body). The oculomotor nerve (cranial 
nerve III), which exits from the rostral midbrain just medial 
to the cerebral peduncle, supplies all the rest of the extra- 
ocular muscles. Although the oculomotor nerve governs 
several different muscles, each muscle receives its innerva- 
tion from a separate group of lower motor neurons within 
the nuclear complex that supplies the third nerve. 
In addition to supplying the extraocular muscles, a dis- 
tinct cell group within the oculomotor complex innervates 
the levator muscles of the eyelid; the axons from these neu- 
rons also travel in the third nerve. Finally, the third nerve 
carries preganglionic parasympathetic axons that are re- 
sponsible for pupillary constriction (see Chapters 12 and 
21) from the nearby Edinger-Westphal nucleus. Thus, dam- 
age to the third nerve results in three characteristic deficits: 
impairment of eye movements, drooping of the eyelid (a 
clinical sign called ptosis), and pupillary dilation. 
Types of Eye Movements 
and Their Functions 
The five basic types of eye movements can be grouped into 
two functional categories: those that serve to shift the di- 
rection of gaze, and those that serve to stabilize gaze. Shifts 
in eye position are necessary to foveate new targets and 
to follow foveated targets as they move in visual space. 
Stabilizing movements of the eyes to maintain foveation 
are induced when the head moves and when there are 
large-scale movements of the visual field. Thus, saccades, 
smooth pursuit movements, and vergence movements shift 
the direction of gaze, and vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic 
movements stabilize gaze. The functions of each type of eye 
movement are introduced here; in subsequent sections, the 
neural circuitry responsible for movements that shift the 
direction of gaze is presented in more detail (see Chapters 
14 and 19 for further discussion of the neural circuitry un- 
derlying gaze-stabilizing movements). 
As noted earlier, saccades are rapid, ballistic movements 
of the eyes that abruptly change the direction of fixation. 
They range in amplitude from the small movements made 
while reading to the much larger movements made while 
gazing around a room. Saccades can be elicited voluntarily,

The metrics of a saccadic eye movement. The 
red line indicates the position of a fixation target and the blue 
line the position of the fovea. When the target moves suddenly 
to the right, there is a delay of about 200 milliseconds before 
the eye begins to move to the new target position. (After Fuchs, 
1967.) 
but they occur reflexively whenever the eyes are open, even 
when they are fixated on a target (see Box 20A). The rapid 
eye movements (REM) that occur during an important 
phase of sleep (see Chapter 28) also are saccades. 
Figure 20.4 shows the time course of a saccadic eye 
movement. After the onset of a target for a saccade (in this 
example, the stimulus was the movement of an already fix- 
ated target), it takes about 200 milliseconds for eye move- 
ment to begin. During this delay, the position of the target 
with respect to the fovea (that is, how far the eye has to 
move) is computed, and the difference between the initial 
and intended position is converted into a motor command 
that activates the extraocular muscles to move the eyes the 
correct distance in the appropriate direction. Saccadic eye 
movements are said to be ballistic because the saccade- 
generating system usually does not respond to subsequent 
changes in the position of the target during the course of 
the eye movement. If the target moves again during this 
time (which is on the order of 15-100 ms), the saccade will 
miss the target, and a second saccade must be made to cor- 
rect the error. 
Smooth pursuit movements are much slower tracking 
movements of the eyes designed to keep a moving stimulus 
on the fovea once foveation is achieved. Such movements 
are under voluntary control in the sense that the observer 
can choose whether or not to track a moving stimulus (Fig- 
ure 20.5). Surprisingly, however, only highly trained ob- 
servers can make a smooth pursuit movement in the ab- 
sence of a moving target. Most people who try to move 
their eyes in a smooth fashion without a moving target to 
track simply make saccades. 
Vergence movements align the fovea of each eye with 
targets located at different distances from the observer. Al- 
though vergence movements are required to track a visual 
EYE MOVEMENTS AND SENSORY MOTOR INTEGRATION

target that may be moving closer or farther away, they are 
more commonly employed when abruptly shifting the di- 
rection of gaze, for example, from a near object to one that 
is more distant. Unlike other types of eye movements, in 
which the two eyes move in the same direction (conjugate 
eye movements), vergence movements are disconjugate 
(or disjunctive); they involve either a convergence or di- 
vergence of the lines of sight of each eye to foveate an object 
that is nearer or farther away. Convergence is one of the 
three reflexive visual responses elicited together by inter- 
est in a near object. The other components of the so-called 
near reflex triad are accommodation of the lens, which by 
increasing the curvature of the lens brings the object into 
focus, and pupillary constriction, which by reducing spheri- 
cal aberration increases the depth of field and sharpens the 
image on the retina (see Chapter 11). 
Vestibulo-ocular movements and optokinetic eye 
movements operate together to move the eyes and sta- 
bilize gaze relative to the external world, thus compensat- 
ing for head movements. These reflex responses prevent 
visual images from "slipping" on the surface of the retina 
as head position varies and, more rarely, when confronted 
with large-scale movements of the visual scene (such as a 
flowing river or a passing train). 
The action of vestibulo-ocular movements can be ap- 
preciated by fixating an object and moving the head from 
side to side; the eyes automatically compensate for the 
head movement by moving the same distance and at the 
same velocity but in the opposite direction, thus keeping 
the image of the object at more or less the same place on the 
20%/s

retina. The vestibular system detects brief, transient changes 
in head position and produces rapid, corrective eye move- 
ments using the pathways described in Chapter 14. Sensory 
information from the semicircular canals directs the eyes to 
move in a direction opposite to the head movement. Al- 
though the vestibular system operates effectively to counter- 
act rapid movements of the head, it is relatively insensitive 
to slow movements (below 1 Hz) or to persistent rotation of 
the head. For example, if the vestibulo-ocular reflex is tested 
with continuous rotation of a subject and without visual cues 
about the movement of the image (i.e., with eyes closed or 
in the dark), the compensatory eye movements cease after 
only about 30 seconds of rotation. However, if the same test 
is performed with visual cues, eye movements persist. The 
compensatory eye movements in this case are due to the 
activation of another system that relies not on vestibular in- 
formation, but on visual cues indicating motion of the visual 
field. This optokinetic system is especially sensitive to slow 
movements (below 1 Hz) of large areas of the visual field, 
and its response builds up slowly. These features comple- 
ment the properties of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, especially 
as head movements slow down and vestibular signals de- 
cay (Figure 20.6). Thus, should a visual image slowly "slip" 
across the retina, the optokinetic system will respond by in- 
ducing compensatory movements of the eyes that maintain 
foveation of a visual target. 
The optokinetic system can be tested by seating a subject 
in front of a screen on which a series of horizontally mov- 
ing vertical bars is presented. The eyes automatically track 
the stripes until the eyes reach the end of their excursion. 
Then there is a quick saccade in the direction opposite to 
the movement, followed once again by smooth pursuit of 
the stripes. This alternation of slow and fast movement of 
the eyes in response to such stimuli is called optokinetic 
nystagmus. Optokinetic nystagmus is a normal reflexive 
tems. Functions of the vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic systems were assessed inde- 
pendently in rabbits by rotating the animals with their eyes closed (to isolate the ves- 
Vestibulo- 
tibulo-ocular reflex) or following recovery from bilateral labyrinthectomy (to isolate 
ocular 
the optokinetic system). At low frequencies of movement (below 1 Hz or one back- 
reflex 
— 
and-forth cycle of stimulation per second), the gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (the 
s 
ratio of eye movement to head movement) diminishes below unity. However, the 
gain of the optokinetic system (the ratio of eye movement to retinal slip) approaches 
unity at such low frequencies of stimulation. Thus, the vestibulo-ocular and optoki- 
netic systems act in a complementary, frequency-dependent fashion to stabilize gaze 
over a broad range of stimulation frequencies (After Baarsma and Collewijn, 1974.) 
response of the visual and oculomotor systems in response 
to large-scale movements of the visual scene and should not 
be confused with the pathological nystagmus that can result 
from certain kinds of brain injury (for example, damage to 
- the vestibular system or the cerebellum; see Chapter 19). 
Neural Control of Saccadic Eye 
Movements 
The problem of moving the eyes to fixate a new target in 
space (or indeed any other movement) involves two sepa- 
rate tasks: controlling the amplitude of movement (how far), 
and controlling the direction of the movement (which way). 
The amplitude of a saccadic eye movement is encoded by 
the duration of neuronal activity in the lower motor neu- 
rons of the oculomotor nuclei. For instance, as shown in 
Figure 20.7, neurons in the abducens nucleus fire a burst of 
action potentials just prior to abducting the eye (by causing 
the lateral rectus muscle to contract) and are silent when 
the eye is adducted. The amplitude of the movement is cor- 
related with the duration of the burst of action potentials 
in abducens neurons. Following each saccade, abducens 
neurons reach a new baseline level of discharge that is cor- 
related with the position of the eye in the orbit. The steady 
baseline level of firing holds the eye in its new position. 
The direction of the movement is determined by which 
eye muscles are activated. Although in principle any given 
direction of movement could be specified by independently 
adjusting the activity of individual eye muscles, the complex- 
ity of the task would be overwhelming. Instead, the direction 
of eye movement is controlled by the local circuit neurons in 
two gaze centers in the reticular formation (see Box 17A), 
each of which is responsible for generating movements along 
a particular axis. The paramedian pontine reticular forma- 
tion (PPRB), also called the horizontal gaze center, is a col- 
lection of local circuit neurons near the midline in the pons. 
These neurons are responsible for generating horizontal eye 
movements. The rostral interstitial nucleus, or vertical 
gaze center, is located in the rostral part of the midbrain 
reticular formation and is responsible for vertical move- 
ments. Activation of each gaze center separately results in

movements of the eyes along a single axis, either horizontal 
or vertical. Activation of the gaze centers in concert results 
in oblique movements whose trajectories are specified by the 
relative contribution of each center.

of the brain. The abducens nucleus contains two types of 
neurons. One type comprises the lower motor neurons that 
innervate the lateral rectus muscle on the same side. The 
other type, called internuclear neurons, send their axons 
across the midline. These axons ascend in a fiber tract called 
the medial longitudinal fasciculus and terminate in the 
portion of the oculomotor nucleus that contains lower mo- 
tor neurons that innervate the medial rectus muscle. As a 
result of this arrangement, activation of PPRF neurons in 
the right side of the brainstem causes horizontal move- 
ments of both eyes to the right; likewise, activation of PPRF 
neurons in the left half of the brainstem induces horizontal 
movements of both eyes to the left. 
Figure 20.8 
Synaptic circuitry responsible for hori- 
zontal movements of the eyes to the right. This 
simplified diagram depicts how activation of local circuit 
neurons in the right horizontal gaze center (the right 
PPRF; orange) leads to increased activity of lower motor 
neurons (red and green) and internuclear neurons (blue) 
in the right abducens nucleus. The lower motor neurons 
innervate the lateral rectus muscle of the right eye. The 
internuclear neurons project via the medial longitudinal 
fasciculus to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus, where 
they activate lower motor neurons that in turn innervate 
the medial rectus muscle of the left eye. 

442 
CHAPTER 20 
Neurons in the PPRF also send axons to the medullary 
reticular formation, where they contact inhibitory local cir- 
cuit neurons. These local circuit neurons, in turn, project 
to the contralateral abducens nucleus, where they termi- 
nate on lower motor neurons and internuclear neurons. 
In consequence, activation of neurons in the PPRF on the 
right results in a reduction in the activity of the lower motor 
neurons in the left abducens nucleus, whose muscles would 
oppose movements of the eyes to the right (see Figure 20.7). 
This inhibition of antagonists resembles the strategy used 
by local circuit neurons in the spinal cord to control limb 
muscle antagonists (see Chapter 16). 
Although saccades can occur in complete darkness, they 
are often elicited when something attracts attention and the 
observer directs the foveas toward the stimulus for more 
detailed examination. How then is sensory information 
about the location of a salient target in space transformed 
into an appropriate pattern of activity in the horizontal and 
vertical gaze centers? Two regions of the brain that project 
to the gaze centers are demonstrably important for the ini- 
tiation and accurate targeting of saccadic eye movements: 
the superior colliculus of the midbrain (called the optic 
tectum in non-mammalian vertebrates) and several areas 
in the frontal and parietal cortex. Especially well studied is a 
region of the frontal lobe that lies in a rostral portion of the 
premotor cortex, known as the frontal eye field (classically, 
Brodmann's area 8, although in humans the frontal eye field 
may encroach posteriorly into Brodmann's area 6). Upper 
motor neurons in both the superior colliculus and frontal eye 
fields, each of which contains a topographical map of eye 
movement vectors, discharge immediately prior to saccades. 
Thus, activation of a particular site in the superior colliculus 
or in the frontal eye field produces saccadic eye movements 
in a specified direction and for a specified distance. This 
movement is independent of the initial position of the eyes

induced by 
in the orbit; the direction and distance are always the same 
for a given site. Consistent with a topographic map of eye 
movement vectors, the direction and distance of movement 
change 'systematically when different sites in the frontal eye 
field are activated. This arrangement is a good example of 
the principle that the activation of specific movements rather 
than individual muscles are encoded by these motor areas. 
Both the superior colliculus and the frontal eye field also 
contain cells that respond to visual stimuli; however, the re- 
lationship between the sensory and motor responses of in- 
dividual cells is better understood for the superior colliculus. 
An orderly map of visual space is established by the termi- 
nation of retinal axons within the superior colliculus, which 
are supplemented by cortical inputs from visual areas that 
participate in the dorsal spatial vision pathway (see Figure 
12.18). This sensory map is in register with the motor map 
that generates eye movements. Thus, neurons in a particular 
region of the superior colliculus are activated by visual stimuli 
in a limited region of visual space. This activation leads to the 
generation of a saccade that moves the eye by an amount just 
sufficient to align the foveas with the region of visual space 
that provided the stimulation (Figure 20.9). 
Figure 20.9 
The sensory map of visual space in the supe- 
rior colliculus is in register with the motor map 
that generates eye movements. Evidence for this registration 
has been obtained from electrical recording and stimulation.

that corresponds to the visual receptive fields of neurons at that 
site. (After Schiller and Stryker, 1972.)

Neurons in the superior colliculus also respond to audi- 
tory and somatic sensory stimuli. Indeed, location in space 
for these other modalities is mapped in register with the vi- 
sual and motor maps in the colliculus. Topographically or- 
ganized maps of auditory space and of the body surface in 
the superior colliculus can therefore orient the eyes (and the 
head, via output projections from the superior colliculus to 
neurons that give rise to the reticulospinal tract; see Chapter 
17) in response to a variety of different sensory stimuli. This 
registration of the sensory and motor maps in the colliculus 
illustrates an important principle of topographical maps: they 
provide an efficient mechanism for the transformation of

sensory signals into the movements that are guided by these 
signals (in this case, the extraocular muscles and muscles of 
the posterior head and neck; Box 20B). However, the motor 
map in the deep layers of the superior colliculus is not simply 
organized in the framework established by the spatial distri- 
bution of the sensory inputs. Rather, the input signals must 
also be encoded in movement coordinates so that both sen- 
sory cues and cognitive signals (see below) can activate the 
motor responses required to move the eyes to the intended 
position in the orbits. Thus, the output of the superior col- 
liculus specifies motor goals rather than movements to fixed 
positions in external space or on the body surface. 
the foveas toward that same location in 
structure in which differences between 
the layers provide clues about how 
sensory and motor maps interact to 
| produce appropriate movements. As 
discussed in the text, the superficial or 
"visual" layer of the colliculus receives 
input from retinal axons that form a 
topographic map. Thus, each site in the 
for how the eyes might be guided 
toward an object of interest in the 
visual field. When an object appears 
at a particular location in the visual 
field, it will activate neurons in the cor- 
responding part of the visual map. As 
a result, bursts of action potentials are 
generated by the subjacent motor cells 
to command a saccade that rotates the 
the visual field. This behavior is called 
"visual grasp" because successful sen- 
sory motor integration results in the 
accurate foveation of a visual target.

between the visual and motor maps. In 
practice, however, these connections 
have been difficult to demonstrate. 
Neither the anatomical nor the physi- 
- ological methods available at the time 
_ were sufficiently precise to establish 
_ these postulated synaptic connections. 
_ At about the same time, motor neurons 
_ were found to command saccades to 
- nonvisual stimuli; moreover, spontane- 
ous saccades occur in the dark. Thus, 
_ it was clear that visual layer activity is 
_ not always necessary for saccades. To 
- confuse matters further, animals could 
be trained not to make a saccade when 
an object appeared in the visual field, 
showing that the activation of visual 
_ neurons is sometimes insufficient to 
- command saccades. The fact that activ- 
ity of neurons in the visual map is nei- 
ther necessary nor sufficient for eliciting 
saccades led investigators away from 
the simple model of direct connections 
between corresponding regions of the 
two maps, toward models that linked 
the layers indirectly through pathways 
that detoured through the cortex. 
Eventually, however, new and bet- 
ter methods resolved this uncertainty. 
Techniques for filling single cells with 
axonal tracers showed an overlap 
between descending visual layer axons 
and ascending motor layer dendrites, in 
accord with direct anatomical connec- 
tions between corresponding regions 
of the maps. At the same time, in vitro 
whole-cell patch clamp recording (see 
Box 4A) permitted more discriminating 
functional studies that distinguished 
excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the 
motor cells. These experiments showed 
that the visual and motor layers do 
indeed have the functional connections 
required to initiate the command for a 
visually guided saccadic eye movement.

ered to the superficial layer generates 
The organizing framework of this motor map was dem- 
onstrated in an ingenious series of studies performed by 
David Sparks and his colleagues at the University of Ala- 
bama. They showed that retinal error signals (i.e., the dis- 
tance and direction of the retinal projection of the target 
from the fovea) in retinotopic coordinates are often not

tude of the activation of those muscles. 
In other words, to make a saccade go 
_ farther, the muscle pulling the eye must 
pull harder and longer than it would 
_ for a shorter saccade. Amplitude is 
' 
therefore a monotonic function of muscle 
activation.

_ formed from a code in which collicular

_ amplitudes to a code in which most or 
all a motor neurons respond, regard-

and/or duration of their activity varies 
monotonically with saccade amplitude. 
This transformation occurs before sig- 
nals from the superior colliculus reach 
the a motor neurons that activate the 
- extraocular muscles. 
Various models have been proposed 
to explain this transformation. The basic 
idea, shared by all models, is that the

saccade vector, as signaled by the locus

decomposed into two monotonic ampli-

the horizontal and vertical components 
of the saccade vector. The weights of 
the projections from the superior col- 
liculus to the horizontal and vertical 
gaze control centers are thought to be 
tailored to accomplish this. For example, 
a site in the superior colliculus where 
the movement fields encode 5° right- 
ward movements would project to the 
rightward horizontal gaze control center 
with a modest strength. A site encoding 
10° rightward saccades would send a 
stronger projection to that center. A site 
encoding an oblique saccade with a 10° 
horizontal and a 5° vertical component 
would project to both the horizontal and 
vertical centers, with weights propor- 
tional to the required contribution along 
each direction (Figure C).

This model is too simple to account 
for all the relevant experimental find-

transformation is a likely requirement 
of sensory motor integration in many 
behavioral contexts where sensory cues 
guide movement.

results consistently showed, however, that this was not the 
case. The animals compensated for the stimulation-induced 
shift by performing a compensatory saccade (a saccade in- 
dicated by the oblique, black dashed arrow to the T that 
appears within a black circle—the actual target location— 
in Figure 20.10A). This compensatory action was based on 
stored information about the location of the retinal image 
and current information about the position of the eyes in 
the orbit. The upper motor neurons that initiate the com- 
pensatory saccade are located at the expected site in the 
motor map of saccade vectors, but their activation depends 
on information in addition to the retinotopic location of the 
target. This information may be provided by circuits in the 
cerebral cortex that integrate these cues and, in turn, direct 
the site in the superior colliculus that initiates the compen- 
satory saccade (Figure 20.10B). 
This study and several that followed showed that sig- 
nals from different sensory modalities are integrated and 
transformed into a common motor frame of reference that 
encodes the direction and distance of the eye movements 
necessary to foveate an intended target. This "place code" 
for intended eye position generated in the upper motor 
neurons of the superior colliculus is then translated into 
a "rate code" by downstream gaze centers in the reticular 
formation that can then direct the activity of lower motor 
neurons in the ocular motor nuclei (Box 20C). 
The eye movement regions of the cerebral cortex col- 
laborate with the superior colliculus in controlling saccades. 
Thus, the frontal eye field projects to the superior colliculus, 
and the superior colliculus projects to the PPRF on the con- 
tralateral side (Figure 20.11). (It also projects to the vertical 
gaze center, but for simplicity the discussion here is lim- 
ited to the PPRF.) The frontal eye field can thus control eye 
movements by activating selected populations of superior 
colliculus neurons. This cortical area also projects directly to 
the contralateral PPRF; as a result, the frontal eye field can 
also control eye movements independently of the superior 
colliculus. The parallel inputs to the PPRF from the frontal 
eye field and superior colliculus are reflected in the different 
deficits that result from damage to these structures. Injury 
to the frontal eye field results in an inability to make sac- 
cades to the contralateral side and a deviation of the eyes 
to the side of the lesion. These effects are transient, how- 
ever; in monkeys with experimentally induced lesions of 
this cortical region, recovery is virtually complete in 2 to 4 
weeks. Lesions of the superior colliculus change the latency, 
accuracy, frequency, and velocity of saccades; yet saccades 
still occur, and the deficits also improve with time. These 
results suggest that the frontal eye fields and the superior 
colliculus provide complementary pathways for the control 
of saccades. Moreover, one of these structures appears to 
be able to compensate (at least partially) for the loss of the 
other. In support of this interpretation, combined lesions of

Neurons in the frontal eye field collaborate

in the right cerebral hemisphere (Brodmann's area 8) to the supe- 
rior colliculus and the horizontal gaze center (PPRF). In humans, 
the frontal eye field can influence eye movements by either of 
two routes: indirectly, by projections to the ipsilateral superior 
colliculus, which in turn projects to the contralateral PPRF; and 
directly, by projections to the contralateral PPRF. 
the frontal eye field and the superior colliculus produce a 
dramatic and permanent loss in the ability to make saccadic 
eye movements. 
These observations do not, however, imply that the fron- 
tal eye fields and the superior colliculus have the same func- 
tions. Superior colliculus lesions produce a permanent deficit 
in the ability to perform very short-latency, reflex-like eye

movements called express saccades. Express saccades are 
evidently mediated by direct pathways to the superior collic- 
ulus from the retina or visual cortex that can access the upper 
motor neurons in the colliculus without extensive, and more 
time-consuming, processing in the frontal cortex (see Box 
20B). In contrast, frontal eye field lesions produce permanent 
deficits in the ability to make saccades that are not guided by 
an external target. For example, patients (or monkeys) with 
a lesion in the frontal eye field cannot voluntarily direct their 
eyes away from a stimulus in the visual field; this type of 
eye movement is called an "anti-saccade." Such lesions also 
eliminate the ability to make a saccade to the remembered 
location of a target that is no longer visible. 
Finally, the frontal eye fields are essential for systemati- 
cally scanning the visual field to locate an object of interest 
within an array of distracting objects (see Figure 20.1). Fig- 
ure 20.12 shows the responses of a frontal eye field neuron 
during a visual task in which a monkey was required to fo- 
veate a target located within an array of distracting objects.

to the same stimulus, depending on whether the stimulus 
is the target of the saccade or a "distractor," and on the 
location of the distractor relative to the actual target. For ex- 
ample, the differences between the middle and the left and 
right traces in Figure 20.12 demonstrate that the response 
to the distractor is much reduced if it is located close to the 
target in the visual field. Results such as these suggest that 
lateral interactions within the frontal eye fields enhance 
the neuronal responses to stimuli that will be selected as 
saccade targets. They also suggest that such interactions 
suppress the responses to uninteresting and potentially 
distracting stimuli. These sorts of interactions presumably 
reduce the occurrence of unwanted saccades to distracting 
stimuli in the visual field.

represent action potentials, and each row of tick marks is a 
different trial. The graphs below show the average frequency 
of action potentials as a function of time. The change in color 
from beige to blue in each row indicates the time of onset of a 
saccade toward the target. In the left trace (1), the target (red 
square) is in the part of the visual field "seen" by the neuron, and 
the response to the target is similar to the response that would 
be generated by the neuron even if no distractors (blue squares) 
were present (not shown). In the right trace (3), the target is far 
from the response field of the neuron. The neuron responds 
to the distractor in its response field. However, it responds at 
a lower rate than it would to exactly the same stimulus if the 
square were not a distractor but a target for a saccade (left trace). 
In the middle trace (2), the response of the neuron to the distrac- 
tor has been sharply reduced by the presence of the target in a 
neighboring region of the visual field. (After Schall,1995.)

Neural Control of Smooth Pursuit 
Movements 
Traditionally, smooth pursuit and saccades were considered 
to be mediated by different structures, but recent studies 
such as those carried out by Richard Krauzlis at the Salk 
Institute for Biological Studies indicate that these two types 
of eye movements involve many of the same structures. Not 
only are smooth pursuit movements mediated by neurons 
in the PPRF, they also are under the influence of motor con- 
trol centers in the rostral superior colliculus and subareas 
within the frontal eye fields, both of which receive sensory 
input from the "dorsal spatial vision pathway" in the pari- 
etal and temporal lobes. The exact routes by which visual 
information reaches the PPRF to generate smooth pursuit 
movements is not known, but pathways from the cortex to 
the superior colliculus and PPRF similar to those that medi- 
ate saccades may play a role; an indirect pathway through 
the cerebellum also has been suggested (Figure 20.13). It is 
clear, however, that neurons in the striate and extrastriate 
visual areas provide sensory information that is essential 
for the initiation and accurate guidance of smooth pursuit 
movements. In monkeys, neurons in the middle tempo- 
ral area (which is largely concerned with the perception of 
moving stimuli; see Chapter 12) respond selectively to tar- 
gets moving in a specific direction, and damage to this area 
disrupts smooth pursuit movements. In humans, damage

tures and the connections that govern

illustration summarizes data from studies on the 
rhesus monkey brain. Although these two types 
of eye movements were once thought to be 
controlled by separate circuits in the forebrain 
Frontal 
and brainstem, it is now recognized that they 
eye field 
are governed by similar networks of cortical 
and subcortical structures. Visual signals are 
processed by the dorsal spatial vision pathway, 
including the middle temporal and lateral intra- 
parietal areas. Sensory and attentional signals 
then guide motor planning areas in the frontal 
eye field. These cortical areas interact with sub- 
cortical structures, including basal ganglia (cau- 
date and substantia nigra, pars reticulata) and 
pontine-cerebellar structures (pontine nuclei, 
cerebellar vermis, and vestibulocerebellum) 
that modulate the initiation and coordination of 
eye movements by the superior colliculus and 
downstream oculomotor centers in the reticular 
formation and vestibular nuclei. The eye move- 
ments regulated by this complex circuitry are 
guided by a variety of sensory and cognitive sig- 
nals, including perception, attention, memory, 
and reward expectation. (After Krauzlis, 2005.) 
EYE MOVEMENTS AND SENSORY MOTOR INTEGRATION

of comparable areas in the parietal and occipital lobes also 
results in abnormalities of smooth pursuit movements. 
Finally, a pathway from the retina that terminates in the 
cerebellum after relays in the pretectum and inferior olive 
(see Chapter 19) adjusts the gain of this system to ensure 
that the velocity of the eye movements matches that of the 
movement of the visual target. 
Neural Control of Vergence 
Movements 
When a person wishes to look from one object to another 
object that is located at a different distance from the eyes, a 
saccade is made that shifts the direction of gaze toward the 
new object, and the eyes either diverge or converge until 
the object falls on the fovea of each eye. The structures and 
pathways responsible for mediating such vergence move- 
ments are not well understood, but they appear to include 
several extrastriate areas in the occipital lobe. Information 
about the location of retinal activity is relayed through the 
two lateral geniculate nuclei to the cortex, where the infor- 
mation from the two eyes is integrated. The appropriate 
command to diverge or converge the eyes, which is based 
largely on information from the two eyes about the amount 
of binocular disparity (see Chapter 12), is then sent from the 
occipital cortex to "vergence centers" in the brainstem. One 
such center is a population of local circuit neurons located in 
the midbrain near the oculomotor nucleus. These neurons 
generate a burst of action potentials that initiate a vergence 
movement, and the frequency of the burst determines its 
velocity. There is a division of labor within the vergence

center, so that some neurons command convergence move- 
ments while others command divergence movements. 
These neurons also coordinate vergence movements of the 
eyes with accommodation of the lens and pupillary con- 
striction to maximize the clarity of images formed on the 
retina, as discussed in Chapter 11. 
Summary 
Despite their specialized function, the systems that con- 
trol eye movements have much in common with the motor 
systems that govern movements of other parts of the body. 
Just as the spinal cord provides the basic circuitry for coor- 
dinating the actions of muscles around a joint, the reticu- 
lar formation of the pons and midbrain provides the basic 
circuitry that mediates movements of the eyes. Descend- 
ing projections from upper motor neurons in the superior 
colliculus and the frontal eye field innervate the brainstem 
gaze centers, providing a basis for integrating eye move- 
ments with sensory information that indicates the location 
of objects in space. The superior colliculus and the frontal 
eye field are organized in a parallel as well as a hierarchi- 
cal fashion, enabling one of these structures to compensate 
for the loss of the other. Eye movements, like other move- 
ments, are also under the control of the basal ganglia and 
cerebellum; this control ensures the proper initiation and 
successful execution of these relatively simple motor be- 
haviors, thus allowing observers to interact efficiently with 
the universe of things that can be seen.

THE VISCERAL 
Moror SYsTEM 
Overview 
THE VISCERAL, OR AUTONOMIC, MOTOR SYSTEM controls involuntary func- 
tions mediated by the activity of smooth muscle fibers, cardiac muscle fibers, and 
glands. The system comprises two major divisions, the sympathetic and parasym- 
pathetic subsystems. The specialized innervation of the gut is a further, semi-inde- 
pendent division that is usually referred to as the enteric nervous system. Although 
these divisions are always active at some level, the sympathetic division mobilizes 
the body's resources for dealing with challenges of one sort or another. Conversely, 
parasympathetic activity predominates during states of relative quiescence, so that 
energy sources previously expended can be restored. This continuous neural regula- 
tion of the expenditure and replenishment of the body's resources is crucial for the 
overall physiological balance of bodily functions called homeostasis. Whereas the 
major controlling centers for somatic motor activity are the primary and premotor 
motor cortices in the frontal lobes and a variety of related subcortical nuclei, the major 
locus of central control in the visceral motor system is the hypothalamus, which in 
turn is modulated by activity in the amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and other corti- 
cal regions in the ventral and medial aspects of the frontal lobe. The function of both 
principal divisions of the visceral motor system is governed by descending pathways 
from the hypothalamus and the reticular formation to preganglionic neurons in the 
brainstem and spinal cord, which in turn determine the activity of the primary, or 
"lower," visceral motor neurons in autonomic ganglia located outside the central 
nervous system. The autonomic regulation of several organ systems of particular 
importance in clinical practice (including cardiovascular function, control of the blad- 
der, and the governance of the reproductive organs) is considered in more detail as 
specific examples of visceral motor control and the importance of central integration 
for the coordination of somatic motor and visceral motor function.

CHAPTER 21 
Early Studies of the 
Visceral Motor System 
Although humans must always have been aware of invol- 
untary motor reactions to stimuli in the environment (e.g,, 
narrowing of the pupil in response to bright light, constric- 
tion of superficial blood vessels in response to cold or fear, 
increased heart rate in response to exertion), it was not until 
the late nineteenth century that the neural control of these 
and other visceral functions came to be understood in mod- 
ern terms. The researchers who first rationalized the work- 
ings of the visceral motor system were Walter Gaskell and 
John Langley, British physiologists at Cambridge Univer- 
sity. Gaskell's work preceded that of Langley and estab- 
lished the overall anatomy of the system as he carried out 
early physiological experiments that demonstrated some of 
its salient functional characteristics (e.g., that the heartbeat 
of an experimental animal is accelerated by stimulating the 
outflow of the upper thoracic spinal cord segments). Based 
on these and other observations, Gaskell concluded in 1866 
that "every tissue is innervated by two sets of nerve fibers 
of opposite characters," and he further surmised that these 
actions showed "the characteristic signs of opposite chemi- 
cal processes." 
Using similar electrical stimulation techniques in ex- 
perimental animals, Langley went on to establish the func- 
tion of autonomic ganglia (which harbor the lower vis- 
ceral motor neurons), defined the terms "preganglionic" 
and "postganglionic" (see p. 458), and coined the phrase 
autonomic nervous system, which is commonly used as 
a synonym for visceral motor system (although certain so- 
matic motor activities may also be considered "autonomic"; 
see Chapter 29). Langley's work on the pharmacology of 
the autonomic system initiated the classic studies indicat- 
ing the roles of acetylcholine and the catecholamines in 
visceral motor function, and in neurotransmitter function 
more generally (see Chapter 6). In short, Langley's inge- 
nious physiological and anatomical experiments established 
in detail the general proposition put forward by Gaskell on 
more circumstantial grounds. 
The third major figure in the pioneering studies of the 
visceral motor system was Walter Cannon at Harvard Med- 
ical School, who during the early to mid 1900s devoted his 
career to understanding visceral motor functions in rela- 
tion to homeostatic mechanisms and to the emotions and 
higher brain functions (see Chapter 29). Like Gaskell and 
Langley before him, his work was based primarily on elec- 
trical stimulation in experimental animals, including ac- 
tivation of brainstem, other brain regions, and peripheral 
components of the system. He also established the effects of 
denervation in the visceral motor system, laying some of the 
foundation for current understanding of neuronal plasticity 
(see Chapters 8 and 24). 
Distinctive Features of the 
Visceral Motor System 
Chapters'16 and 17 discussed in detail the organization of 
lower motor neurons in the central nervous system, their 
relationships to striated muscle fibers, and the means by 
which their activities are governed by higher motor centers. 
With respect to the efferent systems that govern the actions 
of smooth muscle fibers, cardiac muscle fibers, and glands, 
it is instructive to recognize the anatomical and functional 
features of the visceral motor system that distinguish it from 
the somatic motor system. 
First, the lower motor neurons of the visceral motor 
system are located outside of the central nervous system 
(Figure 21.1). The cell bodies of these primary visceral mo- 
tor neurons are found in autonomic ganglia that are either 
close to the spinal cord (sympathetic division) or embedded 
in aneural plexus—a network of intersecting nerves—very 
near or in the target organ (parasympathetic and enteric 
divisions). 
Second, the contacts between visceral motor neurons 
and the viscera are much less differentiated than the neu- 
romuscular junctions of the somatic motor system. Visceral 
motor axons tend to be highly branched and give rise to 
many synaptic terminals at varicosities (swellings) along 
the length of the terminal axonal branch. Moreover, the 
surfaces of the visceral muscle usually lack the highly or- 
dered structure of the motor endplates that characterizes 
postsynaptic target sites on striated muscle fibers. As a con- 
sequence, the neurotransmitters released by visceral mo- 
tor terminals often diffuse for hundreds of microns before 
binding to postsynaptic receptors—a far greater distance 
than at the synaptic cleft of the somatic neuromuscular 
junction. 
Third, whereas the principal actions of the somatic 
motor system are governed by motor cortical areas in the 
posterior frontal lobe (see Chapter 17), the activities of the 
visceral motor system are coordinated by a distributed set 
of cortical and subcortical structures in the ventral and 
medial parts of the forebrain and in the brainstem; col- 
lectively, these structures comprise a central autonomic 
network. 
Finally, visceral motor terminals release a variety of 
neurotransmitters, including primary small-molecule 
neurotransmitters (which differ depending on whether the 
motor neuron in question is sympathetic or parasympa- 
thetic) and one or more of a variety of co-neurotransmitters 
that may be a different small-molecule neurotransmitter 
or a neuropeptide (see Chapter 6). These neurotransmit- 
ters interact with a diverse set of postsynaptic receptors 
that mediate myriad postsynaptic effects in smooth and 
cardiac muscle and glands. It should be clear, then, that 
whereas the major effect of somatic motor activation on

the effects of visceral motor activation are remarkably var-

systems of the body in the face of variable environmental 
conditions and dynamic behavioral contingencies.

CHAPTER 21 
The Sympathetic Division of the 
Visceral Motor System 
Activity of the neurons that make up the sympathetic di- 
vision of the visceral motor system ultimately prepares 
individuals for "fight or flight," as Cannon famously put 
it. Cannon meant that, in extreme circumstances, height- 
ened levels of sympathetic neural activity allow the body to 
make maximum use of its resources (particularly its meta- 
bolic resources), thereby increasing the chances of survival 
or success in threatening or otherwise challenging situa- 
tions. Thus, during high levels of sympathetic activity, the 
pupils dilate and the eyelids retract (allowing more light 
to reach the retina and the eyes to move more efficiently); 
the blood vessels of the skin and gut constrict (rerouting 
blood to muscles, thus allowing them to extract a maximum

of available energy); the hairs stand on end (making our 
hairier ancestors look more fearsome); the bronchi dilate 
(increasing oxygenation); the heart rate accelerates and the 
force of cardiac contraction is enhanced (maximally perfus- 
ing skeletal muscles and the brain); and digestive and other 
vegetative functions become quiescent (thus diminishing 
activities that are temporarily unnecessary) (see Figure 
21.1). At the same time, sympathetic activity stimulates the 
adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and norepinephrine 
into the bloodstream and mediates the release of glucagon 
from the pancreas, further enhancing energy-mobilizing 
(or catabolic) functions. These coordinated responses il- 
lustrate an important principle of visceral motor function: 
there are circumstances that necessitate a departure from 
homeostatic "set-points" in the regulation of the body's 
physiological systems (Box 21A), and such responses are 
The hypothalamus is located at the base 
_ 
of the forebrain, bounded by the optic 
_ chiasm rostrally and the midbrain teg- 
mentum caudally. It forms the floor and 
ventral walls of the third ventricle and 
_ 
is continuous through the infundibular 
_ 
stalk with the posterior pituitary gland, 
as illustrated in Figure A. Given its cen- 
tral position in the brain and its prox- 
imity to the pituitary, it is not surprising 
that the hypothalamus integrates infor- 
mation from the forebrain, brainstem, 
spinal cord, and various intrinsic che- 
mosensitive neurons. 
What is surprising about this struc- 
ture is the remarkable diversity of 
nucleus 
homeostatic functions that are gov- 
erned by this relatively small region 
of the forebrain. The diverse functions 
in which hypothalamic involvement is 
at least partially understood include: 
the control of blood flow (by promoting 
adjustments in cardiac output, vasomo- 
tor tone, blood osmolarity, and renal 
muclete 
clearance, and by motivating drinking 
and salt consumption); the regulation of 
energy metabolism (by monitoring blood 
glucose levels and regulating feeding 
behavior, digestive functions, metabolic 
rate, and temperature); the regulation 
of reproductive activity (by influencing 
gender identity, sexual orientation and 
mating behavior, and, in females, by 
governing menstrual cycles, pregnancy, 
and lactation); and the coordination 
of responses to threatening conditions

Despite the impressive scope of 
hypothalamic control, the individual 
components of the hypothalamus uti- 
lize similar physiological mechanisms 
to exert their influence over these 
many functions (Figure B). Thus, hypo-

Like the overlying thalamus—and 
consistent with the scope of hypotha-

comprises a large number of distinct 
nuclei, each with its own specific pat-

interconnected, can be grouped in 
three longitudinal regions referred to 
as periventricular, medial, and lateral. 
The nuclei can also be grouped along 
the anterior—posterior dimension into 
the anterior (or preoptic), tuberal, or 
posterior region (Figure C). The anteri- 
or-periventricular group contains the 
suprachiasmatic nucleus, which receives 
direct retinal input and drives circadian 
rhythms (see Chapter 28). More scat- 
tered neurons in the periventricular 
region (located along the wall of the 
_ third ventricle) manufacture peptides 
known as releasing or inhibiting factors, 
_ which control the secretion of a variety 
_ of hormones by the anterior pituitary. 
_ The axons of these neurons project 
| to the median eminence, a region at 
_ the junction of the hypothalamus and 
_ pituitary stalk, where the peptides are 
secreted into the portal circulation that 
| supplies the anterior pituitary. 
_ 
Nuclei in the medial-tuberal region 
' ("tuberal" refers to the tuber cinereum, 
_ the anatomical name given to the mid- 
_ dle portion of the inferior surface of the 
hypothalamus) include the paraventricu- 
lar and supraoptic nuclei, which contain 
the neurosecretory neurons whose 
axons extend into the posterior pituitary. 
With appropriate stimulation, these 
neurons secrete oxytocin or vasopressin 
(antidiuretic hormone) directly into the 
bloodstream. Other neurons in the para- 
ventricular nucleus project to autonomic 
centers in the reticular formation, as well 
as preganglionic neurons of the sym- 
pathetic and parasympathetic divisions 
in the brainstem and spinal cord; these 
cells are thought to exert hypothalamic 
control over the visceral motor system. 
The paraventricular nucleus receives 
inputs from other hypothalamic zones, 
which are in turn related to the cerebral 
cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and 
other central structures, all of which are 
capable of influencing visceral motor 
function. 
Also in this region of the hypothala- 
mus are the dorsomedial and ventro- 
medial nuclei, which are involved in 
feeding, reproductive and parenting. 
behavior, thermoregulation, and water 
balance. These nuclei receive inputs 
from structures in the limbic forebrain, 
as well as from visceral sensory nuclei 
in the brainstem (e.g., the nucleus of 
the solitary tract). 
Finally, the lateral region of the 
hypothalamus is really a rostral con- 
tinuation of the midbrain reticular 
formation (see Box 17D). Thus, the 
| 
neurons of the lateral region are not 
grouped into nuclei, but are scattered 
among the fibers of the medial fore- 
brain bundle, a prominent collection of 
axonal projections that run through the 
lateral hypothalamus. Cells in this later- 
al region control behavioral arousal and 
shifts of attention, especially as related 
to reproductive activities. 
In summary, the hypothalamus 
regulates an enormous range of physi- 
ological and behavioral activities and 
serves as the key controlling center for 
visceral motor activity and homeostatic 
functions that are essential for survival.

coordinated by the sympathetic division of the visceral mo- 
tor system. Thus, the short-term functional goal of auto- 
nomic activity is not always homeostasis (the maintenance 
of a constant internal state). Rather, the coordinated activ- 
ity of visceral motor efferents may, for transient episodes, 
impose allostasis—the restoration of homeostasis through 
physiological and behavior change.

these effects are located in the spinal cord. They are ar-

segments (see Table 21.1) in a region of the spinal cord 
gray matter called the intermediolateral column or lateral 
horn (Figure 21.2). The preganglionic neurons that control 
sympathetic outflow to the organs in the head and thorax 
are in the upper and middle thoracic segments, whereas 
those that control the abdominal and pelvic organs and 
targets in the lower extremities are in the lower thoracic 
and upper lumbar segments. The axons that arise from 
these spinal preganglionic neurons typically extend only a 
short distance, terminating in a series of paravertebral or 
sympathetic chain ganglia, which, as the name implies, are 
arranged in a chain that extends along most of the length of 
the vertebral column (see Figure 21.1). These preganglionic 
pathways to the ganglia are known as the white communicat- 
ing rami because of the relatively light color imparted to the 
rami (singular, ramus) by the myelinated axons they contain 
(see Figure 21.2A). Roughly speaking, these preganglionic 
spinal neurons are comparable to somatic motor interneu- 
rons (see Chapter 16). 
The neurons in sympathetic ganglia are the primary 
or lower motor neurons of the sympathetic division in that 
they directly innervate smooth muscles, cardiac muscle, 
and glands. The postganglionic axons arising from these 
paravertebral sympathetic chain neurons travel to vari- 
ous targets in the body wall, joining the segmental spinal 
nerves of the corresponding spinal segments by way of the 
gray communicating rami. The gray rami are another set of 
short linking nerves, so named because the unmyelinated 
postganglionic axons give them a somewhat darker appear- 
ance than the myelinated preganglionic linking nerves (see 
Figure 21.2A).

In addition to innervating the sympathetic chain gan-

sympathetic ganglia in the cardiac plexus; 
the celiac ganglion; the superior and inferior

in the pelvic plexus. The postganglionic ax- 
ons arising from the prevertebral ganglia 
provide sympathetic innervation to the 
heart, lungs, gut, kidneys, pancreas, liver, 
bladder, and reproductive organs; many of 
these organs also receive some postgangli- 
onic innervation from neurons in the sym- 
pathetic chain ganglia. Finally, a subset of 
thoracic preganglionic fibers in the splanch- 
nic (visceral) nerves innervate the adrenal 
medulla, which is generally regarded as a 
sympathetic ganglion modified for a specific 
endocrine function—namely, the release of 
catecholamines into the circulation to en- 
hance a widespread sympathetic response 
to stress. In summary, sympathetic axons 
contribute to virtually all peripheral nerves, 
carrying innervation to an enormous range 
of target organs (see Table 21.1). 
Cannon's memorable truism that the 
sympathetic activity prepares the animal for 
"fight or flight" notwithstanding, the sym- 
pathetic division of the visceral motor system 
is tonically active to maintain sympathetic 
function at appropriate levels, whatever the 
circumstances. Nor should the sympathetic 
system be thought of as responding in an all-or-none fash- 
ion; many sympathetic reflexes operate more or less inde- 
pendently, as might be expected from the obvious need to 
specifically control various organ functions (e.g., the heart 
during exercise, the bladder during urination, and the re- 
productive organs during sexual intercourse).

CHAPTER 21 
The Parasympathetic Division of the 
Visceral Motor System 
In contrast to the sympathetic division, the preganglionic 
outflow from the central nervous system to the ganglia of 
the parasympathetic division stems from neurons whose 
distribution is limited to the brainstem and the sacral part 
of the spinal cord (Figure 21.3; see also Figure 21.1). The

glands, mediating salivary secretion and the production of 
tears); a visceral motor division of the nucleus ambiguus 
in the medulla; and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus 
nerve, also in the medulla. Neurons in the ventral-lateral 
part of the nucleus ambiguus provide an important source 
of cardio-inhibitory innervation to the cardiac ganglia via 
the vagus nerve. The more dorsal part of the dorsal mo- 
tor nucleus of the vagus nerve primarily governs glandu- 
lar secretion via the parasympathetic ganglia located in 
the viscera of the thorax and abdomen, whereas the more 
ventral part of the nucleus controls the motor responses of 
the heart, lungs, and gut elicited by the vagus nerve (e.g., 
constricting the bronchioles). In addition, other pregan- 
glionic neurons in the nucleus ambiguus innervate para- 
sympathetic ganglia in the submandibular salivary glands 
and the mediastinum (a different division of the nucleus 
ambiguus provides branchiomotor innervation of striated 
muscle in the pharynx and larynx; see the Appendix). The 
location of the parasympathetic brainstem nuclei is shown 
in Figure 21.3. 
The sacral preganglionic innervation arises from neurons 
in the lateral gray matter of the sacral segments of the spinal 
cord, which are located in much the same position as the 
sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the intermediolateral 
column of the thoracic cord (Figure 21.3C,D). The axons 
from these neurons travel in the splanchnic nerves to in- 
nervate parasympathetic ganglia in the lower third of the 
colon, rectum, bladder, and reproductive organs. 
The parasympathetic ganglia innervated by pregangli- 
onic outflow from both cranial and sacral levels are in or near 
the end organs they serve. In this way they differ from the 
ganglionic targets of the sympathetic system (recall that both 
the paravertebral chain and prevertebral ganglia are located 
relatively far from their target organs; see Figure 21.1). An 
important anatomical difference between sympathetic and 
parasympathetic ganglia at the cellular level is that sympa- 
thetic ganglion cells tend to have extensive dendritic arbors 
and are, as might be expected from this arrangement, in- 
nervated by a large number of preganglionic fibers. Para- 
sympathetic ganglion cells have few if any dendrites and 
consequently are each innervated by only one or a few 
preganglionic axons. This arrangement implies a greater di- 
versity of converging influences upon sympathetic ganglion 
neurons compared with parasympathetic ganglion neurons.

THE VISCERAL MOTOR SYSTEM 
461 
The overall function of the parasympathetic system, as 
Gaskell, Langley, and Cannon demonstrated, is generally 
opposite to that of the sympathetic system, serving to in- 
crease metabolic and other resources during periods when 
the animal's circumstances allow it to "rest and digest." In 
contrast to the sympathetic functions enumerated earlier, 
the activity of the parasympathetic system constricts the 
pupils, slows the heart rate, increases the peristaltic activity 
of the gut, and promotes voiding of urine from the bladder. 
At the same time, diminished activity in the sympathetic 
system allows the blood vessels of the skin and gut to di- 
late, the piloerector muscles to relax, and the outflow of 
catecholamines from the adrenal medulla to decrease. 
Although most organs receive innervation from both the 
sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the visceral 
motor system (as Gaskell surmised), some receive only sym- 
pathetic innervation. These exceptional targets include the 
sweat glands, the adrenal medulla, the piloerector muscles 
of the skin, and most arterial blood vessels (see Table 21.1). 
The Enteric Nervous System 
. An enormous number of neurons are specifically associated 
with the gastrointestinal tract to control its many functions; 
indeed, it is likely that more neurons reside in the human 
gut than in the entire spinal cord. As already noted, the ac- 
tivity of the gut is modulated by both the sympathetic and 
the parasympathetic divisions of the visceral motor system. 
However, the gut also has an extensive system of nerve cells 
in its wall (as do its accessory organs such as the pancreas 
and gallbladder) that do not fit neatly into the sympathetic 
or parasympathetic divisions of the visceral motor system 
(Figure 21.4A). To a surprising degree, these neurons and 
the complex enteric networks in which they are found oper- 
ate more or less independently according to their own reflex 
rules; as a result, many gut functions continue perfectly well 
without sympathetic or parasympathetic supervision (peri- 
stalsis, for example, occurs in isolated gut segments in vitro). 
Thus, most investigators prefer to classify the enteric nervous 
system as a separate component of the visceral motor system. 
The neurons in the gut wall include local and centrally 
projecting sensory neurons that monitor mechanical and 
chemical conditions in the gut, local circuit neurons that in- 
tegrate this information, and motor neurons that influence 
the activity of the smooth muscles in the wall of the gut 
and glandular secretions (e.g., of digestive enzymes, mu- 
cus, stomach acid, and bile). This complex arrangement of 
nerve cells intrinsic to the gut is organized into (1) the my- 
enteric (or Auerbach's) plexus, which is specifically con- 
cerned with regulating the musculature of the gut; and (2) 
the submucous (or Meissner's) plexus, which is located, 
as the name implies, just beneath the mucus membranes 
of the gut and is concerned with chemical monitoring and 
glandular secretion (Figure 21.48).

Sensory Components of the 
Visceral Motor System 
Although the focus of this unit is movement and its central 
control, it is important to understand the sources of visceral 
sensory information and the means by which this input be- 
comes integrated with visceral motor networks in the cen- 
tral nervous system. Generally speaking, afferent activity 
arising from the viscera serves two important functions. 
First, it provides feedback to local reflexes that modulate 
moment-to-moment visceral motor activity within indi- 
vidual organs. Second, it informs higher integrative centers 
of more complex patterns of stimulation that may signal 
potentially threatening conditions and/or require the coor- 
dination of more widespread visceral motor, somatic motor, 
neuroendocrine, and behavioral activities (Figure 21.5). The 
nucleus of the solitary tract in the medulla is the central 
structure in the brain that receives visceral sensory informa- 
tion and distributes it accordingly to serve both purposes.

tor systems in the brainstem and spinal cord.

: 
The afferent fibers that provide these visceral sensory 
inputs arise from cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (as 
is the case of somatic sensory modalities; see Chapters 9 
and 10) and the sensory ganglia associated with the glos- 
sopharyngeal and vagus cranial nerves. However, far fewer 
visceral sensory neurons (by a factor of about 10) innervate 
the skin and deeper somatic structures in comparison with 
the number of mechanosensory neurons that do so. This 
relative sparseness of peripheral visceral sensory innerva- 
tion accounts in part for why most visceral sensations are 
diffuse and difficult to localize precisely. 
The spinal visceral sensory neurons in the dorsal root 
ganglia send axons peripherally, through sympathetic 
nerves, ending in sensory receptor specializations such as 
nerve endings that are sensitive to pressure or stretch (in 
the walls of the heart, bladder, and gastrointestinal tract); 
endings that innervate specialized chemosensitive cells 
(oxygen-sensitive cells in the carotid bodies); or nocicep- 
tive endings that respond to damaging stretch, ischemia, 
or the presence of irritating chemicals. The central axonal 
processes of these dorsal root ganglion neurons terminate 
on second-order neurons and local interneurons in the 
dorsal horn and in intermediate gray regions of the spinal 
cord. Some primary visceral sensory axons terminate near 
the lateral horn, where the preganglionic neurons of sym- 
pathetic and parasympathetic divisions are located; these 
terminals mediate visceral reflex activity in a manner not 
unlike the segmental somatic motor reflexes described in 
Chapter 16. 
In the dorsal horn, many of the second-order neurons 
that receive visceral sensory inputs are actually neurons of 
the anterolateral system, which also receive nociceptive 
and/or crude mechanosensory inputs from more superfi- 
cial sources (see Chapter 10). As described in Box 10B, this 
is one means by which painful visceral sensations may be 
"referred" to more superficial somatic territories. Axons of 
these second-order visceral sensory neurons travel rostrally 
in the ventrolateral white matter of the spinal cord and the 
lateral sector of the brainstem and eventually reach the ven- 
tral posterior complex of the thalamus. However, the axons 
of other second-order visceral sensory neurons terminate 
before reaching the thalamus; the principal target of these 
axons is the nucleus of the solitary tract (Figure 21.6). Other 
brainstem targets of second-order visceral sensory axons 
are visceral motor centers in the medullary reticular forma- 
tion (see Box 17D). 
In the last decade, it has become clear that visceral sen- 
sory information, especially that related to painful visceral 
sensations, also ascends the central nervous system by an- 
other spinal pathway. Second-order neurons whose cell 
bodies are located near the central canal of the spinal cord 
send their axons through the dorsal columns to terminate 
in the dorsal column nuclei, where third-order neurons 
relay visceral nociceptive signals to the ventral posterior

thalamus. Although the existence of this visceral pain 
pathway in the dorsal columns complicates the simplistic 
view of the dorsal column—medial lemniscal pathway as a 
discriminative mechanosensory projection and the antero- 
lateral system as a pain pathway, mounting empirical and 
clinical evidence highlights the importance of this newly 
discovered dorsal column pain pathway in the central trans- 
mission of visceral nociception (see Box 10C). 
In addition to these spinal visceral afferents, general vis- 
ceral sensory inputs from thoracic and upper abdominal or- 
gans, as well as from viscera in the head and neck, enter the 
brainstem directly via the glossopharyngeal and vagus cranial 
nerves (see Figure 21.6). These glossopharyngeal and vagal 
visceral afferents terminate in the nucleus of the solitary tract. 
This nucleus, as described in the next section, integrates a 
wide range of visceral sensory information and transmits this 
information directly (and indirectly) to relevant visceral mo- 
tor nuclei, to the brainstem reticular formation, and to several 
regions in the medial and ventral forebrain that coordinate 
visceral motor activity (see Figure 21.5). 
Finally, unlike the somatic sensory system (where vir- 
tually all sensory signals gain access to conscious neural 
processing), sensory fibers related to the viscera convey 
only limited information to consciousness. For example, 
most of us are completely unaware of the subtle changes in 

464 
CHAPTER 21 
peripheral vascular resistance that raise or lower our mean 
arterial blood pressure, yet such covert visceral afferent in- 
formation is essential for the functioning of autonomic re- 
flexes and the maintenance of homeostasis. Typically, only 
painful visceral sensations enter conscious awareness (see 
Chapter 29). 
Central Control of Visceral 
Motor Functions 
The caudal part of the nucleus of the solitary tract is a key 
integrative center for reflexive control of visceral motor 
function and an important relay for visceral sensory infor- 
mation that reaches other brainstem nuclei and forebrain 
structures (Figure 21.7; see also Figure 21.5). The rostral 
part of this nucleus is a gustatory relay, receiving input from 
primary taste afferents (cranial nerves VIL, IX, and X) and 
sending projections to the gustatory nucleus in the ventral 
posterior thalamus (see Chapter 15). The caudal visceral 
sensory part of the nucleus of the solitary tract 
provides input to primary visceral motor nuclei, 
the interactions among these cortical areas and related sub- 
cortical structures. Taken together, they constitute a cen- 
tral autonomic network. This network accounts for the 
integration of visceral sensory information with input from 
other sensory modalities and from higher cognitive centers 
that process semantic and emotional experiences. Invol- 
untary visceral reactions such as blushing in response to 
consciously embarrassing stimuli, vasoconstriction and pal- 
lor in response to fear, and autonomic responses to sexual 
situations are examples of the integrated activity of this net- 
work. Indeed, autonomic function is intimately related to 
emotional processing, as emphasized in Chapter 29. 
The hypothalamus is a key component of this central 
autonomic network that deserves special consideration. The 
hypothalamus is a heterogeneous collection of nuclei in 
the base of the diencephalon that plays an important role 
in the coordination and expression of visceral motor activity 
'(see Box 21A). The major outflow from the relevant hy- 
pothalamic nuclei is directed toward "autonomic centers" 
such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus 
nerve and the nucleus ambiguus. It also projects 
to "premotor" autonomic centers in the medul- 
Medial prefrontal cortex 
Insular cortex 
lary reticular formation and to higher integrative 
centers in the amygdala (specifically, the central 
group of amygdaloid nuclei; see Box 29B) and hy- 
pothalamus (see below). In addition, the nucleus 
of the solitary tract projects to the parabrachial 
nucleus (so named because it envelopes the su- 
perior cerebellar peduncle, also known by the 
Latin name brachium conjuncttoum). The para- 
brachial nucleus, in turn, relays visceral sensory 
information to the hypothalamus, amygdala, 
thalamus, and medial prefrontal and insular cor- 
tex (see Figure 21.7; for clarity, the cortical pro- 
jections of the parabrachial nucleus are omitted). 
Although one might argue that the posterior 
insular cortex is the primary visceral sensory area 
and the medial prefrontal cortex is the primary 
visceral motor area, it is more useful to emphasize 
FIGURE 21.7 
A central autonomic network for the 
control of visceral motor function. The distribution 
of visceral sensory information within this network is 
illustrated on the right side of the figure; the genera- 
tion of visceral motor commands is shown on the left. 
However, extensive interconnections among autonomic 
centers in the forebrain (e.g., between the amygdala and 
associated cortical regions or hypothalamus) militate 
against a strict parsing of this network into afferent and 
efferent limbs. The hypothalamus, a key structure in this 
network, integrates visceral sensory input and higher- 
order visceral motor signals (see Box 21A).

BOX 21B Horner's Syndrome 
| The characteristic clinical presenta- 
tion of damage to the pathway that 
controls the sympathetic division of 
the visceral motor system to the head 
and neck is called Horner's syndrome, 
after the Swiss ophthalmologist who 
first described this clinical picture in 
the mid-nineteenth century. The main 
features, as illustrated in Figure A, are 
decreased diameter of the pupil on the 
_ side of the lesion (miosis), a droopy 
_ 
eyelid (ptosis), and a sunken appearance 
_ 
of the affected eye (enophthalmos). Less 
_ obvious signs are decreased sweating, 
increased skin temperature, and flush- 
ing of the skin on the same side of the 
face and neck. 
All these signs are explained by a 
loss of sympathetic tone due to dam- 
age somewhere along the pathway 
that connects visceral motor centers in 
the hypothalamus and reticular forma- 
tion with sympathetic preganglionic 
neurons in the intermediolateral cell 
column of the thoracic spinal cord 
(Figure B). Lesions that interrupt these 
fibers often spare the descending 
parasympathetic pathways, which are 
located more medially in the brainstem 
and are more diffuse. The sympathetic 
preganglionic targets that are affected 
by such lesions include the neurons in 
the intermediolateral column in spinal 
segments T1—-T3 that control the dila- 
tor muscle of the iris and the tone in 
smooth muscles of the eyelid and globe, 
the paralysis of which leads to miosis, 
ptosis, and enophthalmos. The flushing 
and decreased sweating are likewise the 
result of diminished sympathetic tone, 
in this case governed by intermedio- 
lateral column neurons in somewhat 
lower thoracic segments. Damage to 
the descending sympathetic pathway 
in the brainstem will, of course, affect 
sweating and vascular tone in the rest 
of the body on the side of the lesion. 
_ However, if the damage is to the upper 
thoracic outflow (as is more typical), the 
upper thoracic chain, or the superior 
cervical ganglion, then the manifesta- 
tions of Horner's syndrome will be 
limited to the head and neck. Typical 
causes in these sites are stab or gunshot

in the reticular formation; these centers can be thought of 
as dedicated premotor circuits that coordinate the efferent 
activity of preganglionic visceral motor neurons. They or- 
ganize specific visceral functions such as cardiac reflexes, 
bladder control reflexes, sexual function reflexes, and critical 
reflexes underlying respiration and vomiting (see Box 17D). 
In addition to these important projections to the reticular 
formation, hypothalamic control of visceral motor function 
is also exerted more directly by projections to the cranial 
nerve nuclei that contain parasympathetic preganglionic 
neurons, and to the sympathetic and parasympathetic 
preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. Nevertheless, 
the autonomic centers of the reticular formation and the 
preganglionic visceral motor neurons that they control are 
competent to function autonomously should disease or in- 
jury impede the ability of the hypothalamus to govern the 
many bodily systems that maintain homeostasis. Figure 
21.7 summarizes the general organization of this central 
autonomic control; some important clinical manifestations 
of damage to this descending system are illustrated in Box 
21B; Box 21C discusses the relevance of this central control 
to the feeding system and the problem of obesity. 
Neurotransmission in the 
Visceral Motor System 
The neurotransmitters utilized by the visceral motor sys- 
tem are of enormous importance in clinical practice, and 
drugs that act on the autonomic system are among the most 
important in the clinical armamentarium. Moreover, auto- 
nomic transmitters have played a major role in the history 
of efforts to understand synaptic function. 
Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter of both 
sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons. 
Nicotinic receptors on autonomic ganglion cells are ligand- 
gated ion channels that mediate a fast EPSP (much like nic- 
otinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction). In contrast, 
muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on ganglion cells are 
members of the 7-transmembrane G-protein-linked recep- 
tor family (see Chapters 6 and 7), and they mediate slower 
BOX 21C Obesity and the Brain 
Obesity and its relationship to a broad 
_ range of diseases—including diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, and cancer—has 
become a major public health concern 
in most developed countries, particu- 
larly the United States. Whereas the 
signature of obesity is obviously an 
excess of body fat, the underlying cause 
or causes are generally thought to lie 
in abnormal regulation by the brain 
circuits that control appetite and satiety. 
This fact makes weight loss particularly 
difficult for many obese individuals. 
Thus, understanding the central ner- 
vous system mechanisms that regulate 
food intake and metabolism is essential 
for developing effective strategies to 
combat this serious health problem. 
The brain regulates appetite and 
satiety (the feeling of fullness following 
a meal) via the neural activity that is 
modulated by chemical signals. These 
chemical signals are secreted into the 
circulation by fat-storing adipose tissues 
throughout the body. Since this feed- 
back loop entails some of the central 
components of the visceral motor sys- 
tem, in addition to endocrine mecha- 
nisms via insulin and growth hormone, 
it is discussed here. 
The peptide ghrelin is secreted by 
the stomach prior to feeding, presum- 
ably as a signal of hunger; adipocytes 
(the cells that concentrate lipids in 
fatty tissues) increase their secretion 
of leptin into the circulation follow- 
ing feeding, presumably one of several 
signals for satiety. The receptors for 
these peptides are concentrated in small 
groups of neurons in the ventrolateral

and anterior hypothalamus (see Box 
21A), which interact with additional 
hypothalamic neurons in the arcuate 
region. These ghrelin- and leptin- 
sensitive cells modulate the activity 
of neurons expressing the opiomela- 
nocortin propeptide (POMC) and the 
subsequent secretion of a-melanocyte 
secreting hormone (a-MSH), one of the

synaptic responses. The primary action of muscarinic re- 
ceptors in autonomic ganglion cells is to close K* channels, 
making the neurons more excitable and generating a pro- 
longed EPSP. Acting in concert with the muscarinic activi- 
ties are neuropeptides that serve as co-neurotransmitters at 
the ganglionic synapses. As described in Chapter 6, peptide 
neurotransmitters also tend to exert slowly developing but 
long-lasting effects on postsynaptic neurons. As a result of 
these two acetylcholine receptor types and a rich repertoire 
of neuropeptide transmitters, ganglionic synapses mediate 
both rapid excitation and a slower modulation of autonomic 
ganglion cell activity. 
The postganglionic effects of autonomic ganglion cells 
on their smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or glandular tar- 
gets are mediated by two primary neurotransmitters: nor- 
epinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACh). For the most 
part, sympathetic ganglion cells release norepinephrine 
onto their targets (a notable exception is the cholinergic 
sympathetic innervation of sweat glands), whereas para- 
sympathetic ganglion cells typically release acetylcholine. 
THE VISCERAL MOTOR SYSTEM 
467 
As might be expected from the foregoing account, these 
two neurotransmitters usually have opposing effects on 
their target tissue—contraction versus relaxation of smooth 
muscle, for example. 
As described in Chapters 6 and 7, the specific effects of 
either ACh or NE are determined by the type of receptor 
expressed in the target tissue and the downstream signaling 
pathways to which these receptors are linked. Peripheral 
sympathetic targets generally have two subclasses of norad- 
renergic receptors in their cell membranes, referred to as a 
and 8 receptors. Like muscarinic ACh receptors, both a and 
8 receptors and their subtypes belong to the 7-transmem- 
brane G-protein—coupled class of cell surface receptors. The 
different distribution of these receptors in sympathetic tar- 
gets allows for a variety of postsynaptic effects mediated by 
norepinephrine released from postganglionic sympathetic 
nerve endings (Table 21.2). 
The effects of acetylcholine released by parasympa- 
thetic ganglion cells onto smooth muscles, cardiac muscle, 
and glandular cells also vary according to the subtypes of 
BOX 21C (continued) 
peptides encoded by the POMC tran- 
script. This hormone evidently regulates 
appetite and satiety by acting on spe- 
cific receptors (particularly the melano- 
cortin receptor subtype called MCR-4) 
located on additional populations of 
hypothalamic and brainstem neurons 
(particularly those in the nucleus of 
the solitary tract), as well as by endo- 
crine mechanisms that remain poorly 
understood. 
The interactions of leptin, ghrelin, 
a-MSH, and MCR-4 were determined 
in animal models. Two recessive muta- 
tions in mice—the obese (ob/ob) and the 
diabetic (db/db)—were identified based 
on excessive body weight and failure to 
regulate food intake, respectively. When 
each mutation was cloned, the mutant 
gene in ob mice turned out to be the 
_ gene for leptin, and the db gene that 
for the leptin receptor. Mutations in the 
POMC (Figure A) and MCR4 genes also 
_ 
lead to obesity in mice. The results of 
inactivation of the ghrelin gene are less 
clear; however, pharmacological and 
physiological studies associate changes 
in ghrelin levels with altered feeding 
patterns and weight loss. Studies in 
mice have thus provided a solid frame- 
work for examining the physiological 
mechanisms regulating food intake in 
humans. Nonetheless, their relevance 
to morbid human obesity remained 
unclear until recently. 
Genetic analysis of individuals in 
human pedigrees with extreme obe- 
sity (determined via measured body 
mass indices and weight/height ratios) 
revealed mutations in one or more of 
the leptin, leptin receptor, or MCR4 
genes. As a result, these individuals 
have little sense of satiety after eating 
and thus fail to regulate food intake 
based on signals other than gastric dis- 
tension, pain, and plasma osmolality. 
How this pathophysiology is related to 
less extreme degrees of obesity is not 
yet known, but it is being intensely 
studied because of its implications for 
normal weight control. 
The emerging understanding of body 
weight regulation by hypothalamic 
circuits that are modulated by feed- 
back elicited by hormonal signals from 
fat tissues has provided new ways of 
thinking about pharmacological thera- 
pies for weight control. Although leptin 
mimetics have proven generally inef- 
fective, leptin administration in human 
subjects with leptin deficiencies does 
reduce food intake and obesity (Figure 
B). Currently, there is great interest in 
drugs that modulate a-MSH signaling 
via MCR-4. Although no effective phar- 
macological therapies presently exist, 
clinical investigators hope that such 
drugs, when combined with behavioral 
changes in dietary practices, will effec- 
tively combat this often intractable and 
increasingly common health problem.

in the gut and M2 receptors in the cardiovascular system. 
Another subclass of muscarinic receptors, M3, occurs in both 
smooth muscle and glandular tissues. Muscarinic receptors 
are coupled to a variety of intracellular signal transduction 
mechanisms that modify K* and Ca** channel conductances. 
They can also activate nitric oxide synthase, which promotes 
the local release of NO in some parasympathetic target tis- 
sues (see, for example, the section later in this chapter that 
discusses autonomic control of sexual function). 
In contrast to the relatively restricted responses generated 
by norepinephrine and acetylcholine released by sympathetic 
and parasympathetic ganglion cells, respectively, neurons of 
the enteric nervous system achieve an enormous diversity of 
effects by virtue of many different neurotransmitters, most of 
which are neuropeptides associated with specific cell groups

Autonomic Regulation of 
Cardiovascular Function 
The cardiovascular system is subject to precise reflex regula- 
tion so that an appropriate supply of oxygenated blood can 
reliably be provided to different body tissues under a wide 
range of circumstances. The sensory monitoring for this 
critical homeostatic process entails primarily mechanical 
(barosensory) information about pressure in the arterial sys- 
tem and, secondarily, chemical (chemosensory) information 
about the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. 
The parasympathetic and sympathetic activity relevant to 
cardiovascular control is determined by the information 
supplied by these sensors. 
The mechanoreceptors, called baroreceptors, are lo- 
cated in the heart and major blood vessels; the chemo- 
receptors are located primarily in the carotid bodies, 
which are small, highly specialized organs located at the

bifurcation of the common carotid arteries (some chemo- 
sensory tissue is also found in the aorta). The nerve end- 
ings in baroreceptors are activated by deformation as the 
elastic elements of the vessel walls expand and contract. 
The chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and aorta re- 
spond directly to the partial pressure of oxygen and car- 
bon dioxide in the blood. Visceral afferents from the aortic 
arch and carotid bifurcation reach the brainstem via the 
vagus nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve, respectively. 
Both afferent systems convey their signals to the nucleus 
of the solitary tract, which relays this information to the 
hypothalamus and the relevant autonomic centers in the 
reticular formation (Figure 21.8). 
The afferent information derived from changes in arte- 
rial pressure and blood gas levels reflexively modulates the 
activity of the relevant visceral motor pathways and, ulti- 
mately, smooth and cardiac muscles and other more spe- 
cialized structures. For example, a rise in blood pressure 
activates baroreceptors that, via the pathway illustrated in 
Figure 21.8, inhibit the tonic activity of sympathetic pregan- 
glionic neurons in the spinal cord. In parallel, the pressure 
increase stimulates the activity of the parasympathetic pre- 
ganglionic neurons in the nucleus ambiguus and the dorsal 
motor nucleus of the vagus that influence heart rate. The 
carotid chemoreceptors also have some influence, but less 
than that stemming from the baroreceptors. 
This shift in the balance of sympathetic and parasympa- 
thetic activity results in reduction of the stimulatory nor- 
adrenergic effects of postganglionic sympathetic innerva- 
tion on the cardiac pacemaker and cardiac musculature. 
These effects are abetted by the decreased output of cat- 
echolamines from the adrenal medulla and the decreased 
vasoconstrictive effects of sympathetic innervation on the 
peripheral blood vessels. At the same time, activation of the 
cholinergic parasympathetic innervation of the heart de- 
creases the discharge rate of the cardiac pacemaker in the 
sinoatrial node and slows the ventricular conduction sys- 
tem. These parasympathetic influences are mediated by an 
extensive series of parasympathetic ganglia in and near the 
heart, which release acetylcholine onto cardiac pacemaker 
cells and cardiac muscle fibers. As a result of this combina- 
tion of sympathetic and parasympathetic effects, heart rate 
and the effectiveness of atrial and ventricular myocardial 
contraction are reduced and the peripheral arterioles dilate, 
thus lowering the blood pressure. 
In contrast to this sequence of events in response to raised 
blood pressure, a fall in blood pressure (as might occur from 
blood loss) has the opposite effect—it inhibits parasympa- 
thetic activity while increasing sympathetic activity. As a re- 
sult, norepinephrine is released from sympathetic postgan- 
glionic terminals, increasing the rate of cardiac pacemaker 
activity and enhancing cardiac contractility, at the same time 
increasing release of catecholamines from the adrenal me- 
dulla (which further augments these and many other sym- 
pathetic effects that enhance the response to this threaten- 
ing situation). Norepinephrine released from the terminals of 
sympathetic ganglion cells also acts on the smooth muscles 
of the arterioles to increase the tone of the peripheral vessels, 
particularly those in the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and mus- 
cles, thus shunting blood away from these tissues to those 
organs where oxygen and metabolites are urgently needed 
to maintain function (e.g., brain, heart, and kidneys in the 
case of blood loss). If these reflex sympathetic responses fail 
to raise the blood pressure sufficiently (in which case the pa- 
tient is said to be in shock), the vital functions of these organs 
begin to fail, often catastrophically. 
A more mundane circumstance that requires a reflex 
autonomic response to a fall in blood pressure is standing 
up. Rising quickly from a prone position produces a shift 
of some 300-800 milliliters of blood from the thorax and 
abdomen to the legs, resulting in a sharp (approximately 
40%) decrease in the output of the heart. The adjustment 
to this normally occurring drop in blood pressure (called 
orthostatic hypotension) must be rapid and effective, 
as evidenced by the dizziness sometimes experienced in 
this situation. Indeed, normal individuals can briefly lose

The sympathetic innervation of the heart arises from the

Autonomic Regulation of the Bladder 
The autonomic regulation of the bladder provides an es- 
pecially instructive example of the interplay between com- 
ponents of the somatic motor system that are subject to 
volitional control (we normally have voluntary control over 
urination), and the sympathetic and parasympathetic divi- 
sions of the visceral motor system, which operate involun- 
tarily. This should not be surprising given that, for many 
mammals, the act of urination (and of defecation) places the 
individual at increased risk for attack, since the capacity for 
immediate fight or flight is reduced. In addition, for many 
mammals, urine contains chemical signals (pheromones) 
that mediate complex social behaviors. The neural control

mechanoreceptors in the bladder wall that convey visceral

horn of the spinal cord. In addition to local connections 
sacral spinal cord segments (S2-S4) that innervate visceral

CHAPTER 21 
the context of bladder filling, they signal when it is safe and 
socially appropriate to urinate. 
When the bladder is full, parasympathetic activity in- 
creases and sympathetic activity decreases, causing the 
bladder to contract and the internal sphincter muscle to 
relax. However, urine is held in check by the voluntary so- 
matic motor innervation of the external urethral sphincter 
muscle. The voluntary control of the external sphincter is 
mediated by motor neurons of the ventral horn in sacral 
spinal cord segments (S2-S4), which cause the striated 
muscle fibers of the sphincter to contract. During blad- 
der filling (and subsequently, until circumstances permit 
urination) these neurons are active, keeping the external 
sphincter closed and preventing bladder emptying (or 
voiding, as clinicians often call this process). During uri- 
nation, this tonic activity is temporarily inhibited, leading 
to relaxation in the external sphincter muscle. Normally, 
this is only possible when integrative signals derived from 
the periaqueductal gray activate a collection of premotor 
neurons in the pontine reticular formation, known as the 
"pontine micturition center" (or Barrington's nucleus). The 
pontine micturition center (micturition is "medicalese" for 
urination) projects to parasympathetic preganglionic neu- 
rons and inhibitory local circuit neurons in the sacral spinal 
cord; the net result is increased parasympathetic outflow 
(leading to stronger contraction of the bladder wall) and 
inhibition of the somatic lower motor neurons that inner- 
vate the external sphincter muscle (allowing for voiding; 
see Figure 21.9B). Thus, urination results from the coor- 
dinated activation of sacral parasympathetic neurons and 
temporary inactivation of motor neurons of the somatic 
motor system; this coordination is ultimately governed by 
the integration of visceral sensory, emotional, social, and 
contextual cues. 
Importantly, individuals who are paraplegic or who oth- 
erwise have lost descending control of the sacral spinal cord 
continue to exhibit reflexive, autonomic regulation of blad- 
der function. Unfortunately, this reflex is not fully efficient 
in the absence of descending motor control, resulting in a 
variety of problems in paraplegics and others with dimin- 
ished or defective central control of bladder function. The 
major difficulty in these cases is incomplete bladder emp- 
tying, which often leads to chronic urinary tract infections 
from the culture medium provided by retained urine, and 
thus the need for an indwelling catheter to ensure adequate 
drainage. Indeed, urinary tract morbidity is recognized as 
the second leading cause of death in patients with spinal 
cord injury. In other individuals with urge-incontinence 
and overactive bladder disorders, leakage of urine and an 
"absence of warning" is the problem. Mounting evidence 
obtained from functional and structural studies of the brains 
of such individuals implicates lesions or dysfunction that 
impairs the integrative activity of the periaqueductal gray 
and its control over the pontine micturition center. 
Autonomic Regulation of 
Sexual Function 
Much like control of the bladder, sexual responses are me- 
diated by the coordinated activity of sympathetic, parasym- 
pathetic, and somatic innervation, all of which is governed 
by complex cognitive, emotional, and contextual cues pro- 
cessed in the limbic forebrain. Although these reflexes differ 
in detail in males and females, basic similarities, not only 
in humans but in mammals generally, allow the autonomic 
sexual responses of the two sexes to be considered together. 
These similarities include: (1) the mediation of vascular di- 
lation, which causes penile or clitoral erection; (2) stimula- 
tion of prostatic or vaginal secretions; (3) smooth muscle 
contraction of the vas deferens during ejaculation in males 
or rhythmic vaginal contractions during orgasm in females; 
and (4) contractions of the somatic pelvic muscles that ac- 
'company orgasm in both sexes. 
Like the urinary tract, the reproductive organs receive 
preganglionic parasympathetic innervation from the sacral 
spinal cord, preganglionic sympathetic innervation from 
the outflow of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spi- 
nal cord segments, and somatic motor innervation from 
a motor neurons in the ventral horn of the lower spinal 
cord segments (Figure 21.10). The sacral parasympathetic 
pathway controlling the sexual organs in both males 
and females originates in the sacral segments S2-S4 and 
reaches the target organs via the pelvic nerves. Activity of 
the postganglionic neurons in the relevant parasympa- 
thetic ganglia causes dilation of penile or clitoral arteries, 
and a corresponding relaxation of the smooth muscles of 
the venous (cavernous) sinusoids, which leads to expan- 
sion of the sinusoidal spaces. As a result, the amount of 
blood in the tissue is increased, leading to a sharp rise in 
the pressure and an expansion of the cavernous spaces (i.e., 
erection). The mediator of the smooth muscle relaxation 
leading to erection is not acetylcholine (as in most post- 
ganglionic parasympathetic actions), but nitric oxide (NO; 
see Chapter 6). The drug sildenafil (Viagra®), for instance, 
acts by inhibiting PDE-5, the predominant phosphodies- 
terase (PDE) expressed in erectile tissue, which leads to an 
increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP. 
This second messenger mediates the activity of endogenous 
NO; thus, PDE-5 inhibitors enhance the relaxation of the 
venous sinusoids and promote erection in males during 
sexual stimulation (when NO is released in erectile tissue). 
Parasympathetic activity also provides excitatory input to 
the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate in males, 
or vaginal glands in females. 
In contrast, sympathetic activity causes vasoconstriction 
and loss of erection. The lumbar sympathetic pathway to 
the sexual organs originates in the thoracolumbar segments 
(T1-L2) and reaches the target organs via the correspond- 
ing sympathetic chain ganglia and the inferior mesenteric

The afferent effects of genital stimulation are conveyed 
centrally from somatic sensory endings via the dorsal roots 
of S2-S4, eventually reaching the somatic sensory cortex 
(reflex sexual excitation may also occur by local stimula- 
tion, as is evident in paraplegics). The reflex effects of such 
stimulation are increased parasympathetic activity, which, 
as noted, causes relaxation of the smooth muscles in the 
wall of the sinusoids and subsequent erection. 
Finally, the somatic component of reflex sexual function 
arises from & motor neurons in the lumbar and sacral spinal 
cord segments. These neurons provide excitatory innerva- 
tion to the bulbocavernosus and ischiocavernosus muscles, 
which are active during ejaculation in males and mediate the 
contractions of the perineal (pelvic floor) muscles that ac- 
company orgasm in both males and females. 
Sexual functions are governed centrally by the antero- 
medial and mediotuberal zones of the hypothalamus, 
which contain a variety of nuclei pertinent to visceral mo- 
tor control and reproductive behavior (see Box 21A). Al- 
though they remain poorly understood, these nuclei ap- 
pear to act as integrative centers for sexual responses and 
are also thought to be involved in more complex aspects 
of sexuality, such as sexual preference and gender identity 
(see Chapter 30). The relevant hypothalamic nuclei receive

might imagine—the cortical and subcortical structures con-

Chapters 29 and 31). 
Summary 
Sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, which contain 
the visceral lower motor neurons that innervate smooth 
muscles, cardiac muscle, and glands, are controlled by pre- 
ganglionic neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. The 
sympathetic preganglionic neurons that govern ganglion 
cells in the sympathetic division of the visceral motor sys- 
tem arise from neurons in the thoracic and upper lumbar 
segments of the spinal cord; parasympathetic preganglionic 
neurons, in contrast, are located in the brainstem and sacral 
spinal cord. Sympathetic ganglion cells are distributed in 
the sympathetic chain (paravertebral) and prevertebral gan- 
glia, whereas the parasympathetic motor neurons are more 
widely distributed in ganglia that lie within or near the or- 
gans they control. Most visceral structures receive inputs 
from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, 
which act in a generally antagonistic fashion. The diversity 
of autonomic functions is achieved primarily by different 
types of receptors for the two primary classes of postgan- 
glionic autonomic neurotransmitters, norepinephrine in 
the case of the sympathetic division and acetylcholine in 
the parasympathetic division. The visceral motor system

CHAPTER 21 
is regulated by sensory feedback provided by dorsal root 
and cranial nerve sensory ganglion cells that make local 
reflex connections in the spinal cord or brainstem and 
project to the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. 
The visceral motor system is also regulated by descending 
pathways from the hypothalamus and brainstem reticular 
formation, the major control centers of homeostasis more 
generally. The importance of the visceral motor control of 
organs such as the heart, bladder, and reproductive or- 
gans—and the many pharmacological means of modulat- 
ing autonomic function—have made visceral motor control 
a central theme in clinical medicine.

The 
Changing 
Brain 
THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY of the 
brain changes dramatically over the human lifespan. As soon 
as the embryonic nervous system is established, the dynamic 
interaction of gene expression, neuronal genesis, axonal and 
dendritic growth, and the formation of connections yield a 
developing brain whose shape, size, and cellular architecture is 
continually transformed. These events relies on the interplay of 
secreted signals and their receptors; on transcriptional regula- 
tors; and on adhesion and recognition molecules that deter- 
mine the appropriate identities, positions, and connections of 
developing neurons. The neural circuits that emerge from these 
developmental processes—most of which occur before birth— 
mediate a remarkably complex array of behaviors. Nevertheless, 
these circuits and the behaviors they serve are refined by sub- 
sequent experience during postnatal life. This "sculpting" occurs 
via activity-dependent molecular mechanisms that translate 
experience into altered synaptic efficacy, gene expression, 
and, ultimately, neuronal growth. Such changes are most pro- 
nounced during developmental "windows" in early life, called 
itical periods. Finally, like any other organ, the brain is sub- 
ject to traumatic insults and disease. Some of 
these processes 
activate repair mechanisms that resemble those used during 
development, but the capacity of the mature brain for repair 
and regeneration is limited. Some new neurons can be gener- 
ated, new axons and dendrites extended, and new connections 
made. These new neural elements, however, rarely completely 
restore brain structure or function. Diseases such as amyo- 
trophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's all reflect 
pathologies of processes that normally contribute to neuronal 
development and to the subsequent maintenance and modifi- 
cation of neural circuitry.

EARLY BRAIN 
DEVELOPMENT 
Overview 
THE ELABORATE ARCHITECTURE OF THE ADULT BRAIN is the product of cell- 
to-cell signals, genetic instructions, and their consequences for the neural stem cells 
in the embryo that generate the entire nervous system. These early events include the 
establishment of the primordial nervous system in the embryo, the initial formation 
of the major brain regions, the generation of neurons from undifferentiated precursor 
or stem cells, and the migration of neurons from sites of generation to their final posi- 
tions. These processes set the stage for the subsequent formation of axon pathways 
and synaptic connections. When any of these processes goes awry—because of ge- 
netic mutation, disease, or exposure to drugs or other chemicals—the consequences 
can be disastrous. Indeed, many well-studied congenital brain defects result from 
interference with the normal mechanisms of early nervous system development, prior 
to the formation of synaptic connections. With the aid of cell biological, molecular, 
and genetic tools, we are beginning to understand the machinery underlying these 
extraordinarily complex events. 
Formation of the Nervous System: 
Gastrulation and Neurulation 
The cells that will generate the nervous system become distinct early in the genera- 
tion of a vertebrate embryo, concurrent with the establishment of the midline and the 
basic body axes: anterior—posterior (mouth—anus), dorsal-ventral (back—belly), and 
medial—lateral (midline—periphery). These axes are foundational for proper genera- 
tion of every organ in the body, including the brain. In addition, the unique curvature 
of the human central nervous system generates a distinctive rostral-caudal (Latin, 
"nose-tail") axis in the developing brain (see Figure A1 in the Appendix). The axes, 
and thus the initiation of neural development, are critically dependent on the process 
of gastrulation. Gastrulation begins as the local invagination of a subset of cells in 
the very early embryo (which starts out as a single sheet of cells). By the time invagi- 
nation is complete, the embryo consists of three layers of cells called the germ layers: 
an outer ectoderm; a middle mesoderm (these cells initiate the invagination that 
defines gastrulation); and an inner endoderm (Figure 22.1A). Based on the position

Neurulation in the mammalian embryo. 
On the left are dorsal views of a human embryo at several 
different stages of early development; each boxed view on 
the right is a midline cross section through the embryo at the 
same stage. (A) During late gastrulation and early neurula- 
tion, the notochord forms by invagination of the mesoderm 
in the region of the primitive streak. The ectoderm overlying 
the notochord becomes defined as the neural plate. (B) As 
neurulation proceeds, the neural plate begins to fold at the 
midline (adjacent to the notochord), forming the neural groove 
and, ultimately, the neural tube. The neural plate immediately 
above the notochord differentiates into the floorplate, whereas 
the neural crest emerges at the lateral margins of the neural 
plate (farthest from the notochord). (C) Once the edges of the 
neural plate meet in the midline, the neural tube is complete. 
The mesoderm adjacent to the tube then thickens and subdi- 
vides into structures called somites—the precursors of the axial 
musculature and skeleton. (D) As development continues, the 
neural tube adjacent to the somites becomes the rudimentary 
spinal cord, and the neural crest gives rise to sensory and auto- 
nomic ganglia (the major elements of the peripheral nervous 
system). Finally, the anterior ends of the neural plate (anterior 
neural folds) grow together at the midline and continue to 
expand, eventually giving rise to the brain. 
of the invaginating mesoderm and endoderm, gastrulation 
defines the midline as well as the anterior—posterior and 
dorsal—ventral axes of all vertebrate embryos. 
The formation of the notochord at the midline of the 
gastrulating embryo is a central event for the development 
of the nervous system. The notochord is a distinct cylinder 
of mesodermal cells that condenses at the midline as the 
mesoderm invaginates and extends from the mid-anterior 
to the posterior aspect of the embryo. It is generated by a 
surface indentation called the primitive pit, which sub- 
sequently elongates to form the primitive streak. As a 
result of these cell movements, the notochord defines the 
embryonic midline, and thus the axis of symmetry for the 
entire body. The ectoderm that lies immediately above the 
notochord, called neuroectoderm, gives rise to the entire 
nervous system (see Figure 22.1A). The notochord itself, 
however, is a transient structure that disappears once early 
development is complete. The notochord specifies the basic 
topography of the embryo, determines the position of the 
nervous system, and is required for subsequent early neural 
differentiation. Along with cells that define the primitive 
pit, the notochord sends inductive signals (see below) to 
the overlying ectoderm that cause a subset of cells to dif- 
ferentiate into neuroectodermal precursor cells. During

this process, called neurulation, the midline ectoderm that 
contains these cells thickens into a distinct columnar epi- 
thelium called the neural plate (Figure 22.1B). The lateral 
margins of the neural plate then fold inward, transform- 
ing the neural plate into a tube (Figure 22.1C,D). The cells 
within this neural tube subsequently gives rise to the brain, 
the spinal cord, and most of the peripheral nervous system. 
Neuroectodermal precursor cells are the progenitor cells 
of the neural tube. Thus, these cells are neural stem cells, 
which in turn divide to produce more precursor cells (self- 
renewal being a hallmark of all stem cells) with the capacity 
to give rise to the full range of cell classes found in mature 

BOX 22A Stem Cells: Promise and Peril 
EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT 
479 
| One of the most highly publicized 
issues in biology has been the potential 
use of stem cells to treat a variety of 
neurodegenerative conditions, includ- 
ing Parkinson's, Huntington's, and 
Alzheimer's diseases. Amidst the social, 
political, and ethical debate set off by 
the promise of stem cell therapies, the 
question of what exactly is a stem cell 
tends to get lost. 
Neural stem cells are an example of 
a broader class of somatic stem cells 
found in various tissues, both dur- 
ing development and in the adult. All 
somatic stem cells share two fundamen- 
tal characteristics: they are self-renew- 
ing; and, upon terminal division and dif- 
ferentiation, they can give rise to the full 
range of cell classes within the relevant 
tissue. Thus, a neural stem cell can give 
rise to another neural stem cell, or to 
any of the differentiated cell types found 
in the central and peripheral nervous 
systems (i.e., inhibitory and excitatory 
neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendro- 
cytes). A neural stem cell is distinct from 
a neural progenitor cell, which is incapable 
of continuous self-renewal and usually 
has the capacity to give rise to only one 
class of differentiated progeny. An oligo- 
dendroglial progenitor cell, for example, 
gives rise to oligodendrocytes until its 
mitotic capacity is exhausted; a neural 
stem cell, in contrast, can generate more 
neural stem cells as well as a full range 
of differentiated neural and glial cell 
classes, presumably indefinitely. 
Neural stem cells, and indeed all 
classes of somatic stem cells, are distinct 
from embryonic stem cells. Embryonic 
stem cells (ES cells) are derived from 
(A) (i) 
pre-gastrula embryos. Like somatic 
stem cells, ES cells have the potential for 
infinite self-renewal. However, ES cells 
can give rise to all tissue and cell types 
of the organism—including the germ 
cells that undergo meiosis and gener- 
ate haploid gametes as well as neural 
and other somatic stem cells (Figure A). 
Somatic stem cells, on the other hand, 
generate only diploid, tissue-specific cell 
types. In some cases, however, somatic 
cells such as skin cells or fibroblasts have 
been induced to acquire stem cell prop- 
erties—including the ability to generate 
all tissues, as ES cells do. These induced 
pleuripotential stem cells, or IPSCs, are 
produced in vitro by introducing the 
genes for several transcription factors 
associated with stem cells into somatic 
cells (e.g., fibroblasts). IPSCs hold out 
great promise for generating stem cells 
from mature individuals for therapeutic 
uses in regeneration and tissue repair. 
The ultimate therapeutic promise of 
stem cells—neural or other types—is 
their ability to generate newly dif- 
ferentiated cells and tissues to replace 
those that may have been lost due to 
disease or injury. Such therapies have 
been imagined for some forms of dia- 
betes (replacement of islet cells that 
secrete insulin) and some hematopoietic 
diseases. In the nervous system, stem 
cell therapies have been suggested for 
replacement of dopaminergic cells lost 
to Parkinson's disease and replacing lost 
neurons in other degenerative disorders. 
While intriguing, this projected use 
of stem cell technology raises some 
significant perils. These include ensur- 
ing the controlled division of stem cells 
when they are introduced into mature 
tissue, and identifying the appropri- 
ate molecular instructions to achieve 
differentiation of the desired cell class. 
Clearly, the latter challenge will need to 
be met with a fuller understanding of 
the signaling and transcriptional regula- 
tory steps used during development to 
guide differentiation of relevant neuron 
classes in the embryo. 
At present, there is no clinically vali- 
dated use of stem cells for human thera- 
peutic applications in the nervous sys- 
tem. Nevertheless, some promising work 
in mice and other experimental animals 
indicates that both somatic and ES cells 
can acquire distinct identities if given 
appropriate instructions in vitro (e., 
prior to introduction into the host), and 
if delivered into a supportive host envi- 
ronment. For example, ES cells grown in 
the presence of platelet-derived growth 
factor, which biases progenitors toward 
glial fates, have generated oligoden- 
droglial cells that can myelinate axons in 
myelin-deficient rats. Similarly, ES cells

cells thus produce neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendroglial 
cells (Box 22A). Eventually, subsets of the neuroectodermal 
precursor cells generate region- and fate-specified neural 
progenitors that differentiate into specific classes of neurons 
in distinct brain structures. 
Not all cells in the neural tube, however, are actively 
dividing, self-renewing neural precursors. The cells at the 
ventral midline of the neural tube differentiate into a spe- 
cialized strip of epithelial-like cells called the floorplate 
(reflecting their position at the ventralmost part of the 
neural tube, adjacent to the notochord; see Figure 22.1). 
Molecular signals from the floorplate as well as from the 
notochord specify position and fate for the neuroectoder- 
mal precursors of the spinal cord and hindbrain. These 
signals lead to differentiation of cells in the ventral portion 
of the neural tube that eventually give rise to spinal and 
hindbrain motor neurons and related interneurons (which 
are thus closest to the ventral midline). Precursor cells 
farther away from the ventral midline give rise to sensory 
relay neurons and related interneurons in more dorsal re- 
gions of the spinal cord and hindbrain. The differentiation 
of these dorsal cell groups is also facilitated by a narrow

strip of neuroepithelial cells at the dorsal midline of the 
neural tube referred to as the roofplate. Like the noto- 
chord, the floorplate and roofplate are transient structures 
that provide signals to the developing neural tube and all 
but disappear once initial nervous system development is 
complete. 
At the dorsalmost limit of the neural tube, along most 
but not all of its length, a third population of precursor cells 
emerges in the neural crest, the region where the edges 
of the folded neural plate come together (Figure 22.2). 
These neural crest cells migrate away from the neural 
tube through a matrix of loosely packed mesenchymal cells 
that fill the spaces between the neural tube, embryonic 
epidermis, and somites. Subsets of neural crest cells fol- 
low different pathways, along which they are exposed to 
additional signals that influence their specific differentia- 
tion (see Figure 22.2B). Thus, neural crest cells give rise to 
a variety of progeny, including the neurons and glia of the 
sensory and visceral motor (autonomic) ganglia, the neuro- 
secretory cells of the adrenal gland, and the neurons of the 
enteric nervous system: Neural crest cells also contribute to 
non-neural structures such as pigment cells, cartilage, and 
bone, particularly in the face and skull.

undifferentiated neural crest cells. (B) Four distinct migratory 
paths lead to differentiation of neural crest cells into specific cell 
types and structures. Cells that follow pathways (1) and (2) give 
rise to sensory and autonomic ganglia, respectively. The precur- 
sors of adrenal neurosecretory cells migrate along pathway (3) 
and eventually aggregate around the dorsal portion of the kid- 
ney. Cells destined to become non-neural tissues (for example, 
melanocytes) migrate along pathway (4). Each pathway permits 
the migrating cells to interact with different kinds of cellular envi- 
ronments, from which they receive inductive signals (see Figure 
22.13). (After Sanes, 1989.) 
The past two decades have witnessed an explosion of 
molecular biological knowledge about the inductive signal- 
ing events that transform neuroectodermal precursors and 
neural stem cells into the diverse cell and tissue types of 
the nervous system. The establishment of cellular diversity, 
outlined in detail in subsequent sections of this chapter, oc- 
curs in parallel with the formation of the anatomical struc- 
tures that will define the gross subdivisions of the brain: the 
spinal cord, brainstem, midbrain, and forebrain. 
Formation of the Major 
Brain Subdivisions 
Soon after the neural tube forms, the forerunners of the ma- 
jor brain regions become apparent as a result of morpho- 
genetic movements that bend, fold, and constrict the tube. 
Initially, the anterior end of the tube forms a crook, or "cane 
handle" (Figure 22.3A). The end of the "handle" nearest 
the sharpest bend is the cephalic flexure, which balloons 
out to form the prosencephalon, which in turn will give 
rise to the forebrain. The midbrain (mesencephalon) 
forms as a bulge above the cephalic flexure. The hindbrain

(rhombencephalon) forms in the long, relatively straight 
stretch between the cephalic flexure and the more caudal 
cervical flexure. Caudal to the cervical flexure, the neural 
tube forms the precursor of the spinal cord. This bending 
and folding diminishes or enlarges the different regions of 
_ 
the lumen enclosed by the developing neural tube. These 
lumenal spaces eventually become the ventricles of the ma- 
ture brain (Figure 22.3B; also see the Appendix). 
Once the primitive brain regions are established, they 
undergo at least two more rounds of partitioning, each of 
which elaborates the developing brain regions into fore- 
runners of adult structures (Figure 22.3C). Thus, the lateral 
aspects of the rostral prosencephalon form the telenceph- 
alon. The two bilaterally symmetric telencephalic vesicles 
include dorsal and ventral territories. The dorsal territory 
will give rise to the rudiments of the cerebral cortex and 
hippocampus, while the ventral territory gives rise to the 
basal ganglia (derived from embryonic structures called the 
ganglionic eminences), basal forebrain nuclei, and olfac- 
tory bulb. The more caudal portion of the prosencephalon 
forms the diencephalon, which contains the rudiments of 
the thalamus and hypothalamus, as well as a pair of lateral 
outpocketings—the optic cups—from which the neural 
portion of the retina will form. The dorsal portion of the 
mesencephalon gives rise to the superior and inferior col- 
liculi, while the ventral portion gives rise to a collection of 
nuclei known as the midbrain tegmentum. The rostral part 
of the rhombencephalon becomes the metencephalon 
and gives rise to the adult cerebellum and pons. Finally, 
the caudal part of the rhombencephalon becomes the my- 
elencephalon and gives rise to the adult medulla. 
How can a simple tube of neuronal precursor cells pro- 
duce such a variety of brain structures? At least part of the 
answer comes from the observation, made early in the 
twentieth century, that much of the neural tube is orga- 
nized into repeating units called neuromeres. This discov- 
ery led to the idea that the process of segmentation—seen

in most animal embryos (as well as in angiosperm plant 
embryos) to establish regional identity in the body by divid- 
ing the embryo into repeated units, or segments—might 
also establish regional identity in the developing brain. 
Enthusiasm for this hypothesis was stimulated by observa- 
tions of the development of the body plan of the fruit fly 
Drosophila. In the fly, early expression of a class of genes 
called homeotic or homeobox genes guides the differen- 
tiation of the embryo into distinct segments that give rise 
to the head, thorax, and abdomen (Figure 22.4A,B). Dro- 
sophila homeobox genes code for DNA-binding proteins 
that modulate the expression of other genes that mediate 
morphogenesis. Similar genes in vertebrates, including 
mammals, referred to as Hox genes, have been identified. 
Rather than one copy of each segmentally essential homeo- 
box gene, as seen in the fly, Hox genes have undergone

the embryo, defining the anterior—posterior axis. Then hairy (h) 
expression helps to delineate the domains that will eventually

individual segments. (C) Parallels between Drosophila segmental 
genes (the inferred "ancestral" homeobox genes from which

independent groups, each on a distinct human chromosome. 
The anterior-to-posterior pattern of Hox gene expression in both 
flies and mammals (including humans) follows the 3'-to-5' orien- 
tation of these genes on their respective chromosomes. (A after

BOX 22B Rhombomeres 
An interesting parallel between early 
| embryonic segmentation and early 
_ brain development was noticed shortly 
| after the dawn of the twentieth century. 
_ Several embryologists reported repeat- 
_ ing units in the early neural plate and 
_ neural tube, which they called neuro- 
_ meres. In the late 1980s, A. Lumsden, 
R. Keynes, and their colleagues, as well 
as R. Krumlauf, R. Wilkinson, and col- 
_ leagues, noticed further that combina- 
_ 
tions of homeobox (Hox) and related 
_ genes are expressed in banded patterns 
_ in the developing chick nervous system, 
_ especially in the hindbrain (the com- 
mon name for the rhombencephalon 
and its derivatives). These expression 
| domains defined rhombomeres, which 
_ 
in the chick (as well as in most mam- 
_ mals) are a series of seven transient 
bulges in the developing rhomb- 
encephalon corresponding to the

neuromeres described earlier (Figure 
A). Rhombomeres are sites of differen- 
tial cell proliferation (cells at rhombo- 
mere boundaries divide faster than cells 
in the rest of the rhombomere), differ- 
ential cell mobility (cells from any one 
rhombomere cannot easily cross into 
adjacent rhombomeres), and differential 
cell adhesion (cells prefer to stick to 
those of their own rhombomere). 
Later in development, the pattern of 
axon outgrowth from the cranial motor 
nerves also correlates with the earlier 
rhombomeric pattern (Figure B). Cranial 
motor nerves (see Table A2 in the 
Appendix) originate either from a single 
rhombomere or from specific pairs of 
neighboring rhombomeres (transplan- 
tation experiments indicate that rhom- 
bomeres are in fact specified in pairs). 
Thus, Hox gene expression probably 
represents an early step in the forma- 
tion of cranial nerves in the developing 
brain. Mutation or ectopic activation of 
Hox genes in mice alters the position of 
specific cranial nerves, or prevents their 
formation. Mutation of the HoxA-1 gene 
by homologous recombination—the so- 
called "knockout" strategy for targeting 
mutations to specific genes—prevents 
normal formation of rhombomeres. 
In these animals, development of the

of Hox gene expression (colored bands) and the differentiation of the cranial sensory

rhombomeres are a distinct set of ridges and valleys in the developing hindbrain (left). 
Developing axons follow rhombomere boundaries, visualized by labeling the hindbrain 
with antibodies against neurofilament proteins (right). (C) In the zebrafish, the expression 
of rhombomere-specific genes—in this case Krox 20, a Hox-related transcription factor— 
are limited to rhombomere boundaries (left). Other molecules, including the transcrip- 
tion factor mariposa, distinguish rhombomere boundaries (right). (B from Lumsden and

external, middle, and inner ear is also 
compromised, and cranial nerve gan- 
glia are fused and located incorrectly. 
Conversely, when the HoxA-1 gene is 
expressed in a rhombomere where it is 
usually not seen, the ectopic expression 
causes changes in rhombomere iden- 
tity and subsequent differentiation. It 
is likely that problems in rhombomere 
_ formation are the underlying cause 
_ of congenital nervous system defects 
involving cranial nerves, ganglia, and 
peripheral structures derived from the 
cranial neural crest (the part of the neu- 
ral crest that arises from the hindbrain). 
The exact relationship between early 
| 
patterns of rhombomere-specific gene 
transcription and subsequent cranial 
nerve development remains a puzzle. 
Nevertheless, the correspondence 
between these repeating units in the 
_ embryonic brain and similar iterated 
differential expression of transcription 
factors in specific regions is essential for 
the normal development of many spe- 
cies. In a wide variety of animals, spa- 
tially and temporally distinct patterns of 
transcription factor expression coincide 
with spatially and temporally distinct 
patterns of differentiation, including the 
differentiation of the nervous system. 
This has been elegantly demonstrated 
in zebrafish, where gene expression 
patterns clearly define rhombomeres 
(Figure C). Mutations in these genes 
disrupt region-specific neural differen- 
tiation in the hindbrain. 
The idea that the bulges and folds in 
the neural tube are segments defined 
by patterns of gene expression provides 
an attractive framework for under- 
standing the molecular basis of pattern 
formation in the developing vertebrate 
brain.

units in the development of the insect 
body (see Figure 22.4) suggests that 
multiple duplications so that today's vertebrates have four 
"clusters" of homologous genes with similar functions. In 
most mammals, including humans, each Hox gene cluster 
is located on a distinct chromosome, and their anterior- 
to-posterior expression and function is reflected in their 
position 5'— 3' on that chromosome. In some cases in 
the developing nervous system, the pattern of Hox gene 
expression coincides with, or even precedes, the forma- 
tion of morphological features—that is, the various bends, 
folds, and constrictions—that underlie the progressive re- 
gionalization of the developing neural tube, particularly 
in the hindbrain and spinal cord (Box 22B; Figure DRA! 
In vertebrates, Hox gene expression does not extend into 
the midbrain or forebrain; however, regional differences in 
expression of other transcription factors are seen in these 
subdivisions prior to and during the morphogenetic events 
that define them (see Figure 22.6). The genes seen in the 
vertebrate midbrain and forebrain (including members of 
the distaless-DLX and paired box-PAX families) are homo- 
logs of transcription factors in Drosophila that influence the 
development of body structures such as appendages, head 
and mouthparts, and sensory organs. 
The patterned expression of Hox genes and the genes for 
other developmentally regulated transcription factors and 
signaling molecules does not by itself determine the fate of 
a group of embryonic neural precursors. Instead, this aspect

early brain development contributes to a broader series of 
cellular and molecular processes that eventually produce 
fully differentiated brain regions with appropriate classes 
of neurons and glia. 
The Molecular Basis of 
Neural Induction 
Neural stem cells in the early neural plate and tube, and 
subsequently within each nascent brain region, must ac- 
quire instructions that establish their capacity to make 
nerve cells specific to each region. It is clear that these 
instructions come from neighboring cells or tissues. Dur- 
ing the first half of the twentieth century, the instructions 
needed for gastrulation and neurulation were defined using 
a variety of classic experiments based on the removal or 
transfer of embryonic tissues to assess the capacity of ecto- 
dermal, mesodermal, and endodermal cells to form organs 
composed of differentiated cell types. Cells that are moved 
either acquire the identity of the new region in which they 
are placed (thus receiving instructions based on their new 
location), or they retain an identity that reflects their origi- 
nal position (and thus possess immutable instructions from 
their original location). Cells that are removed are either 
compensated by local cell proliferation, causing little notice- 
able disruption of subsequent development (a process re- 
ferred to as embryonic regulation); or their absence disrupts

Major inductive signaling pathways in vertebrate embryos. (A) The 
embryonic notochord, floorplate, and neural ectoderm, as well as adjacent tissues such 
as somites, produce the molecular signals that induce cell and tissue differentiation in the 
vertebrate embryo. (B-F) Schematics of ligands, receptors, and primary intracellular signal- 
ing molecules for retinoic acid (RA); members of the FGF and TGF-6 (BMP) superfamily of

subsequent differentiation of distinct classes of neurons and glia throughout the brain. 
subsequent development. Finally, in some cases, relocation of cells causes a com- 
plete change of the local developmental program. (For example, transplantation 
of the equivalent of the cells that define the primitive pit to another location on an 
early embryo can cause a second notochord to form and a second nervous ieee 
to develop). 
Taken together, these experiments showed that interactions between cells in ad- 
jacent germ layers (e.g., mesoderm adjacent to ectoderm) are essential for regional 
and cellular identity in the developing embryo. By the early 1920s, it was clear 
that apposition of the notochord to the overlying ectoderm is essential for estab= 
lishing neuroectodermal stem cells and thus the entire nervous system, a process 

known as neural induction. These experiments suggested 
that neural induction relies on signals provided locally by 
adjacent cells or tissues; however, the ultimate proof of this 
conjecture did not emerge until the early 1990s. 
In the past two decades, molecular and genetic approaches 
have demonstrated that the generation of cell identity and 
diversity—of which neural induction is only one example— 
results from the spatial and temporal control of different sets 
of genes by endogenous signaling molecules. Most of these 
molecular signals are secreted by one embryonic cell class 
or tissue and then diffuse through extracellular space to act 
on an adjacent cell class or tissue. The embryonic structures 
that are critical for the induction and patterning of the central 
nervous system (including the notochord, floorplate, roof- 
plate, and neuroectoderm itself, as well as adjacent meso- 
dermally derived tissues such as somites) all secrete these 
inductive signals (Figure 22.5A). Different classes of receptors 
transduce the signals within the neuroectoderm to drive fur- 
ther cellular differentiation. In some cases, the signals have 
graded effects based on the distance of target cells from the 
source. These effects may represent a diffusion gradient of 
the signal, or graded activity due to the distribution pattern 
of receptors or other signaling components. Other signals 
are more specific in their action, being most effective at the 
boundaries between distinct cell populations. The results 
of inductive signaling include changes in gene expression, 
shape, and motility in the target cells. 
One of the first inductive signals to be identified was 
retinoic acid (RA), a derivative of vitamin A and a mem- 
ber of the steroid/thyroid superfamily of hormones (Figure 
22.5B). Retinoic acid is a small, lipophilic molecule synthe- 
sized via metabolic enzymes, similar to gonadal steroids 
and small-molecule neurotransmitters. RA activates a 
unique class of transcription factors that are also receptors 
for the ligand—the retinoid receptors—that modulate the 
expression of a number of target genes. The capacity of RA 
receptors, when bound by RA, to stimulate or repress gene 
expression depends on co-activators or co-repressors that 
form complexes with the receptors when bound to nuclear 
DNA. RA signaling drives cellular differentiation, regulat- 
ing the transitions between various classes of neural stem 
cells leading up to their terminal division for neurogenesis. 
Excess retinoid signaling (due to excessive or insufficient 
dietary intake of vitamin A or retinoid-based medications) 
can cause severe birth defects, including incomplete neural 
tube closure and other disruptions of early brain morpho- 
genesis (Box 22C). 
Most inductive signaling molecules, however, are pep- 
tide hormones. The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family 
of peptide hormones is among the largest sets of inductive 
signals. There are 22 different FGF ligands encoded by 22 
genes in the human genome. All of these ligands bind to 
the same receptor tyrosine kinases that initiate a phosphor- 
ylation-based signaling cascade via the Ras-MAP kinase 
EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT 
487 
pathway (Figure 22.5C). MAP kinase activation can lead to 
altered expression of a number of target genes, especially 
those that modulate cell proliferation and differentiation. 
Among mammals, including humans, FGFs, FGF8 has 
emerged as a particularly important regulator of forebrain 
and midbrain development. In addition, FGFs from the 
pre-somitic mesoderm (from which somites form) regulate 
spinal cord neurogenesis. 
The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members 
of the TGF-8 family of peptide hormones, are particularly 
important for a variety of events in neural induction and 
differentiation. The various BMPs play roles in the initial 
specification of the neural plate as well as the subsequent 
differentiation of the dorsal part of the spinal cord and hind- 
brain and the cerebral cortex. In humans and other mam- 
mals, six distinct genes encode six different BMP ligands. 
These ligands all activate a singular signaling pathway via 
the same receptor serine kinases, resulting in the phosphor- 
ylation and translocation to the nucleus of transcriptional 
regulators called SMADs (Figure 22.5D). Following Bmp- 
dependent phosphorylation, three different SMADs—, 5, 
and 8—translocate into the nucleus, where they influence 
transcription of a number of target genes. 
In mesodermal cells, the BMPs (as their name suggests) 
elicit osteogenesis (bone cell formation). When ectodermal 
cells are exposed to BMPs, they assume an epidermal fate, 
forming structures associated with the skin. How, then, do 
ectodermal cells become neuralized, given that BMPs are 
secreted by the somites and surrounding mesodermal tis- 
sue? The mechanism evidently relies on the local activity of 
additional secreted inductive signaling molecules, includ- 
ing Noggin and Chordin—two members of a broad class 
of endogenous antagonists that modulate signaling via 
the TGF-§8 family (including the BMPs). These antagonis- 
tic molecules can bind directly to BMPs, preventing their 
binding to BMP receptor proteins (see Figure 22.5D). When 
BMPs are thus blocked from their "normal" receptors, neu- 
roectoderm is "rescued" from becoming epidermis and 
continues along a path of neuralization. This negative regu- 
lation has reinforced speculation that becoming a neuron 
is the "default" fate for embryonic ectodermal cells. Once 
neuronal precursor identity is firmly established, however, 
BMPs can act on neural precursors or differentiating neu- 
rons to further influence their identity and fate. 
Members of the Wnt family of secreted signals also 
modulate several aspects of nervous system morphogen- 
esis and neuronal differentiation, including some aspects 
of neural crest differentiation. In contrast to several other 
inductive signaling pathways, the 19 human Wnt ligands 
(encoded by 19 separate genes) can activate two distinct 
signal transduction cascades, the "canonical" and "nonca- 
nonical" pathways. Although researchers elucidated the ca- 
nonical pathway first, the noncanonical pathway is featured 
during early nervous system morphogenesis.

CHAPTER 22 
_ In the early 1930s, investigators noticed 
_ that vitamin A deficiency during preg- 
- nancy in animals led to a variety of fetal 
_ malformations. The most severe abnor- 
_ malities affected the developing brain, 
_ which was often grossly malformed. At 
_ about the same time, experimental stud- 
ies yielded the surprising finding that 
excess vitamin A caused similar defects. 
These observations suggested that a 
_ family of retinoid compounds—meta- 
_ bolic precursors or derivatives of vitamin 
A—are teratogenic. (Teratogenesis is the 
term for birth defects induced by exog- 
enous agents.) The retinoids include 
the alcohol, aldehyde, and acid forms of 
vitamin A (retinol, retinal, and retinoic 
acid, respectively). 
The disastrous consequences of 
exposure to exogenous retinoids dur- 
_ ing human pregnancy were under- 
scored in the early 1980s when the 
drug Accutane (the generic name for 
isotretinoin, or 13-cis-retinoic acid) was 
introduced to treat severe acne. Women 
who used this drug during pregnancy 
had an increased number of spontane- 
ous abortions and children born with a 
range of birth defects. The reasons for 
the adverse effects of retinoids on fetal 
development remained obscure well 
into the late twentieth century. 
An important insight into teratogenic 
potential of retinoids came when embry- 
ologists working on limb development 
in chicks found that retinoic acid mim- 
ics the inductive ability of tissues in the 
limb bud. Still, the mystery remained as 
to just what retinoic acid (or its absence) 
was doing to influence or compromise 
development. An essential clue came 
BOX 22C Retinoic Acid: Teratogen and Inductive Signal 
in the mid-1980s, when the receptors 
for retinoic acid were discovered. These 
receptors are members of the steroid/ 
thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. 
When they bind retinoic acid or similar 
ligands, the receptors act as transcrip- 
tion factors to activate specific genes. 
Careful biochemical analysis showed 
that embryonic tissues synthesized 
retinoic acid, and subsequent studies 
showed that retinoic acid activates gene 
expression at several sites in the embryo, 
including the developing brain (see fig- 
ure). Among the most important targets 
for retinoic acid regulation are genes for 
other inductive signals, including Sonic 
hedgehog (see Box 22E). Thus, an excess 
or deficiency of retinoic acid can disrupt 
normal development by eliciting inap- 
propriate patterns of retinoid-induced 
gene expression. 
The role of retinoic acid as both a 
teratogen and an endogenous signal- 
ing molecule implies that the retinoids 
cause birth defects by mimicking or 
inerfering with the normal signals that 
influence gene expression. The story 
provides a good example of how tera- 
togenic, clinical, cellular, and molecu- 
lar observations can be combined to 
explain seemingly bizarre developmen- 
tal pathology.

¢ The noncanonical Wnt pathway, also known as the pla- 
nar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, regulates cell move- 
ments necessary for lengthening the neural plate 
and neural tube. Here Wnt ligands activate receptor 
proteins (Frizzled), leading to changes in intracellular 
Ca** levels; alternatively, the Wnt ligands can bind an 
orphan receptor-tyrosine kinase, leading to activation 
of a Jun Kinase (Jnk) signaling pathway that can phos- 
phorylate a number of intracellular targets, leading to 
changes in cell shape and polarity (Figure 22.5E). 
The canonical Wnt pathway influences cell proliferation 
adhesion, and differentiation after the initial mor- 
phogenesis of the nervous system (gastrulation and 
neurulation) is complete. This pathway relies on the 
activation of the Frizzled receptor in the presence of 
a co-receptor (Lrp5/6) which leads to stabilization of 
8-catenin, a cellular messenger which is then translo- 
cated to the nucleus, where it influences gene expres- 
sion via interactions with the TCF/LEF transcription 
factor (Figure 22.5F). 
y 
Another peptide hormone essential for induction in 
the developing nervous system is Sonic hedgehog (Shh). 
Sonic hedgehog is thought to be particularly important for 
two phases of neural development: (1) closing the neu- 
ral tube, especially the anterior midline (see Box 22E), 
and (2) establishing the identity of neurons—particularly 
motor neurons—in the ventral portion of the spinal cord 
and hindbrain. The transduction of signals via Shh (Fig- 
ure 22.5G) requires the cooperative binding of two surface 
receptor proteins, Patched and Smoothened (the names 
are based on the appearances of their respective Drosoph- 
ila mutants). In the absence of Shh, an inhibitory protein 
complex assembles that modulates a family of transcrip- 
tional regulators (Glil1, 2, and 3, originally discovered as 
oncogenes in gliomas). When this inhibitory complex is 
in place, only Gli3—which represses transcription of tar- 
get genes—is available and active in the nucleus. When 
Shh is present, it binds to Patched and promotes the ac- 
cumulation of Smoothened on the cell surface, causing 
disassembly of the inhibitory complex and allowing Gli1 
(or Gli2) to be translocated into the nucleus, where they 
positively regulate the expression of genes that establish 
neural identity. 
Integrated Inductive Signals Establish 
Neuron Identity 
The combined activities of retinoic acid, FGFs, BMPs (an- 
tagonized by Noggin/Chordin), Wnt's, and Sonic hedge- 
hog specify a mosaic of transcription factors in subsets of 
precursor cells throughout the developing neural tube. The 
activity of these signals and their transcription factor targets 
is best understood in the spinal cord, where they interact 
EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT 
489 
to establish differences in gene expression in the dorsal, 
intermediate, and ventral spinal cord (Figure 22.6A-C). 
This mechanism of signaling and transcriptional control 
sequentially limits downstream gene expression in neural 
precursors, leading to specific patterns of gene expression in 
postmitotic neuronal progeny. Additional transcription fac- 
tors, also influenced by local inductive signals, are thought 
to specify neuronal identity in immature postmitotic neu- 
roblasts; they also support position-specific differentiation 
of sensory relay neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons 
in dorsal, intermediate, and ventral positions in the spi- 
nal cord. This mechanism—local signaling leading to lo- 
cal variation in transcription factor expression in distinct 
precursor cells or early postmitotic neuroblasts—operates 
throughout the developing central and peripheral nervous 
systems. The combination of transcription factors necessary 
to establish identity of specific neuron classes is often re- 
ferred to as a "transcriptional code." Indeed, although some 
of the signaling molecules and transcription factors are dif- 
ferent, a similar mechanism establishes identity for neuro- 
nal progenitors in the forebrain (Figure 22.6D), where local 
inductive signaling and transcriptional differences among 
_ cells prefigure morphogenesis and cellular differentiation in 
forebrain subdivisions including the neocortex, basal gan- 
glia, hippocampus, basal forebrain (amygdala and other 
ventrolateral structures), and olfactory bulb. Thus, inductive 
signals, their receptors, and the resulting regulation of gene 
expression (particularly of locally expressed transcription 
factors) can specify cell identity as well as influencing other 
aspects of neural development. 
The Initial Differentiation 
of Neurons and Glia 
The mature human brain contains about 100 billion neurons 
and many more glial cells, all generated over the course 
of only a few months from a small population of precur- 
sor cells. Neurogenesis begins after the initial patterning 
of the neural tube is complete. At this time, precursor cells 
in various brain regions have distinct signatures of gene 
expression that assign basic identities. These precursor cells 
are located in the ventricular zone: the innermost cell layer 
surrounding the lumen of the neural tube, and a region of 
extraordinary proliferative activity during gestation. It has 
been estimated that a developing human generates about 
250,000 new neurons each minute during the peak of cell 
proliferation. Except for a few specialized cases (see Chapter 
25), the entire neuronal complement of the adult brain is 
produced during a time window that closes before birth; 
thereafter, precursor cells mostly disappear and, in most 
brain regions, few if any new neurons can be added to re- 
place those lost by age or injury. 
Dividing precursor cells in the ventricular zone undergo 
a stereotyped pattern of cell movements as they progress

on to become sensory relay neurons (dorsal), interneurons (inter-

through the cell cycle, leading to the formation of either 
new stem or precursor cells or postmitotic neuroblasts 
(immature nerve cells) that differentiate into neurons 
(Figure 22.7). The distinction between different modes of 
cell division that give rise to either new stem cells or to 
neuroblasts is an essential aspect of the process of neuro- 
genesis. Thus, the regulation of cell division, as well as the 
regulation of expression of distinct transcription factors, is 
a key determinant of the fate of any cell in the developing 
nervous system.

New stem cells arise from symmetric divisions of neu- 
roectodermal cells. These cells divide relatively slowly and 
can renew themselves indefinitely. Surprisingly, neural 
stem cells seem to acquire and retain many of the molecular 
characteristics of glial cells. Thus, in the developing brain, 
some multipotent neural precursors are indistinguishable 
from the radial glial cells that also act as a substrate for 
migration of postmitotic neurons in the cerebral cortex (see 
below). Postmitotic neurons, in contrast, are generated 
from cells that divide asymmetrically: one of the two daugh- 
ter cells becomes a postmitotic neuroblast while the other 
re-enters the cell cycle to give rise to yet another postmitotic 
progeny via asymmetric division (see Figure 22.7A). Such 
asymmetrically dividing progenitors are molecularly distinct 
from the slowly dividing radial glial stem cells (see Figure 
22.10) and, although they tend to divide more rapidly, they 
have a limited capacity for division over time. They are 
sometimes known as transit amplifying cells because they 
are a transitional form between stem cells and differentiated 
neurons, and they account for the amplification in numbers 
of differentiated cells due to their rapid mitotic kinetics and 
serial asymmetric divisions. 
Different populations of spinal cord neurons, as well as 
nuclei of the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral cortex are 
distinguished by the times when their component neu- 
rons are generated. Some of these distinctions are influ- 
enced by local differences in the signaling molecules and 
transcription factors that characterize the precursors (see

cells are closest to the outer surface of the tube, they enter the 
DNA synthesis phase (S stage) of the cell cycle. Once the nucleus 
moves back to the ventricular surface (G2 stage), the precursor 
cells lose their connection to the outer surface and enter mito- 
sis. When mitosis is complete, the two daughter cells extend 
processes back to the outer surface of the neural tube, and the

new precursor cells enter a resting (G1) phase of the cell cycle. At 
some point a precursor cell generates either another progenitor 
cell that will go on dividing and a daughter cell—a neuroblast— 
that will not divide further, or two postmitotic daughter cells.

BOX 22D Neurogenesis: Where, When, and What 
_ The process by which neurons are gen- 
_ erated is generally referred to as neuro- 
_ genesis. "Where" a postmitotic neuron 
- comes from—the position and identity 
_ of its progenitor cell—is referred to as its 
_ lineage. "When" neurogenesis occurs 
_ for any particular neuron is called its 
- neuronal birthdate. At some point in 
development, neural stem cells (see Box 
_ 22A) undergo asymmetrical divisions 
_ that produce both another stem cell and 
a neuronal precursor (called a neuro- 
_ blast) that will never again undergo cell 
_ division. "What" a cell becomes relies 
_ on the expression of specific molecular 
_ markers that distinguish each of the 
myriad nerve cell types generated dur- 
_ ing development. The where, when, and 
what of neurogenesis can be determined 
_ using techniques that trace lineages, 
determine birthdates, and detect the 
molecular markers that define a neu- 
ron's identity. 
In animals with extraordinarily simple 
nervous systems, such as the worm 
Caenorhabditis elegans, it is possible to 
directly monitor with a microscope each 
embryonic stem cell as it undergoes 
its characteristic series of cell divisions, 
_ and thereby to determine when a spe- 
cific neuron is born, as well as its initial 
progenitors (its lineage). In the vastly 
more complex vertebrate brain, however, 
this approach is not feasible. Vertebrate 
lineages are elucidated by introducing a 
stable tracer into a progenitor cell that 
will be inherited by all of that progeni- 
_ tor's progeny; one must inject tracer only 
into one cell and then record all of 
the cells that retain the injected label 
(Figure A). This approach, however, 
does not tell us about the details of cell

proliferation—how fast cells synthesize 
DNA and divide, and when neuroblasts 
undergo their terminal cell division and 
are thus "born." To obtain this informa- 
tion, neurobiologists rely on the char- 
acteristics of the cell cycle itself to label 
cells according to their date of birth. 
When cells are actively replicating 
DNA, they take up nucleotides—the 
building blocks of DNA. Cell birthdating 
studies use a labeled nucleotide that can 
be incorporated only into newly syn- 
thesized DNA—usually tritium-labeled 
thymidine or a chemically distinctive 
analog of thymidine (the DNA-specific 
nucleotide) such as bromodeoxyuridine 
(BrDU)—at a known time in the organ- 
ism's developmental history (Figure B). 
All stem cells that are actively synthesiz- 
ing DNA incorporate the labeled tag and 
pass it on to their descendants. Because 
the labeled probe is only available for 
minutes to hours after being injected, if 
a stem cell continues to divide, the levels 
of labeled probe in the cell's DNA are 
quickly diluted. However, if a cell under- 
goes only a single division after incorpo- 
rating the label and produces a postmi- 
totic neuroblast, that neuron retains high 
levels of labeled DNA indefinitely. Once 
the animal has matured, histological 
sectioning of the brain shows the labeled 
neurons. The most heavily labeled cells 
are those that incorporated the tag just 
before their final division; these are 
therefore said to have been "born" at 
the time of injection. One of the earli- 
est insights obtained from this approach 
was that the layers of the cerebral cortex 
develop in an "inside-out" fashion (see 
Figure 22.8). In certain mutant mice, 
such as reeler (see Box 19B), birthdating

studies show that the oldest cells erro- 
neously end up in the most superficial 
layers and the most recently generated 
cells in the deepest, the result of defec- 
tive migration. 
Neuronal birthdates do not reveal 
when the cells acquire specific pheno- 
typic or molecular features. Molecular 
labeling methods are used to determine 
the specific identity of any neuron after 
it has undergone its final division. These 
methods are aimed at detecting either 
messenger RNA that distinguishes gene 
expression in one cell versus another 
(in situ hybridization; see Chapter 1) or 
the presence of specific proteins (immu- 
nocytochemistry; see Chapter 1). These 
methods can be combined with lineage 
tracing and birthdating to provide a 
fairly comprehensive answer to the key 
questions of where, when, and what for 
neurogenesis.

(cortical neurogenesis) 
Figure 22.6D). In the cerebral cortex, most neurons of the 
six cortical layers are generated in an inside-out manner; 
each layer consists of a cohort of cells "born'"—and which 
therefore undergo their terminal cell divisions—at a dis- 
tinct time (Box 22D). The firstborn cells are eventually lo- 
cated in the deepest layers; later generations of neurons 
migrate radially from the site of their final division in the 
ventricular zone, traveling through the older cells and 
coming to lie superficial to them (Figure 22.8; see Box 22F 
for an intriguing exception to this rule). These differences 
in time of cell origin are matched by differences in gene 
expression in distinct cohorts of cells. In the cortex, early- 
born neurons in the lower cortical layers express transcrip- 
tion factors distinct from those of the later-born neurons 
in the upper cortical layers. Indeed, in most regions of the 
central nervous system where neurons are arranged into 
layered or laminar structures (the hippocampus, cerebel- 
lum, superior colliculus, and retina), there is a systematic 
relationship between the layers, time of cell origin, and 
additional molecular properties, including transcription 
factor expression. In these brain regions, neuroblasts from 
the ventricular zone either migrate or are passively dis- 
placed radially and outward, thus establishing a systematic 
relationship between the time of a cell's final division and 
its laminar position. The implication of this phenomenon 
is that organized periods of neurogenesis are important 
for the development of the cell types and connections that 
characterize the distinct brain regions. 
Molecular Regulation 
of Neurogenesis 
Clearly, the mode of cell division within populations of 
neural precursor cells is an essential determinant of their 
future capacity to either generate more cells or begin to

during the first half of pregnancy and are complete on or about

differentiate into a mature neuron. Accordingly, there 
must be extensive molecular regulation of the prolifera- 
tive and differentiation capacities of neural stem cells and 
newly generated neurons in the developing nervous sys- 
tem. Interactions between a family of cell surface ligands, 
the Deltas, and their cell surface receptors, the Notches, 
are key regulators of neural stem cell decisions to generate 
either additional stem cells or postmitotic neurons (Figure 
22.9A). These neurogenic decisions are made primarily on 
the basis of influences from immediately neighboring cells. 
Thus, signaling via Delta ligands binding to Notch recep- 
tors happens only between cells that are next to one an- 
other. Delta binding to Notch via apposition of the plasma 
membranes of two neighboring cells leads to the cleavage 
of the intracellular domain of the receptor, liberating a 
protein fragment of the Notch receptor (the "Notch in- 
tracellular domain," or NICD) into the cytoplasm, from 
whence it is transported into the nucleus. Once inside the 
nucleus, NICD binds to a transcriptional complex includ- 
ing the "recombining binding protein J" (RBP-J) that is 
normally repressive. Binding the NICD, however, reverses 
RBP-J repression and results in the transcription of a num- 
ber of genes, including a family of transcription factors

Delta-Notch signaling among neighboring cells leads to 
downregulation of Delta in several cells (thus diminishing 
signaling capacity), but to its upregulation in one or a few 
of the neighboring cells. In Delta-upregulated cells, bHLH 
gene expression is also upregulated, and the cell becomes

cleaves a protein fragment of the receptor (the "Notch intracel-

ing in the transcription of (among others) the Hes family of tran- 
scription factors, including the bHLH neurogenic factors respon- 
sible for neuronal differentiation. (B) Delta, Notch, and bHLH 
proteins are expressed at similar levels in a cluster of progenitor 
cells and neuroblasts. A stochastic increase in Delta ligands ona

cells, while in the Delta-upregulated cell, bHLH gene expression 
is also upregulated, and the cell becomes primed for neuronal 
differentiation.

and astrocytes, Thus, although influenced by secreted pat- 
terning factors, the ultimate decision to exit the cell cycle 
and embark on terminal neurogenesis or gliogenesis ap- 
pears to be regulated by local, cell contact-mediated in- 
teractions that depend initially on Delta—Notch signaling.

The Generation of Neuronal Diversity 
Neural precursor cells that look and act more or less the 
same give rise to postmitotic cells that are enormously di- 
verse. On the most basic level, these precursors produce 
neurons and glial cells, two cell types with markedly dif- 
ferent properties and functions. Neuronal stem cells then 
differentiate to produce the diverse neurons and glia of each 
of the brain regions specified during early morphogenetic 
events that guide initial steps of brain development. Thus, 
morphology, neurotransmitter synthesis, cell surface mol- 
ecules, and the types of synapses made or received distin- 
guish neuron classes of the spinal cord, brainstem, cerebel- 
lum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and subcortical nuclei, 
including the basal ganglia and thalamus. 
The bulk of evidence favors the view that neuronal dif- 
ferentiation is based primarily on local cell-cell interac- 
tions followed by distinct histories of transcriptional regu- 
lation via a "code" of transcription factors expressed in 
each cell, specified by diffusible as well as local cell-cell 
signals (Figure 22.10; see also Figures 22.5, 22.6, and 22.9).

Generation of neural precursors, or stem cells, relies first on the 
balance of BMP and its endogenous antagonists (e.g., Noggin and 
Chordin) in the developing embryo. Next, local sources of induc- 
tive signals, including TFG-f family members and Sonic hedgehog, 
establish gradients that influence subsequent neural precursor 
identities, as well as identifying local "organizers" (such as the 
floorplate and roofplate) that define the cellular identity of the 
inductive signaling centers. (4-7) Steps thought to define neurons, 
oligodendroglia, and astrocytes from multipotent neuronal pre- 
cursors. Balanced signaling activity of Notch and transcriptional 
control of the bHLH proneural genes (named based on their abil-

fate) influence neurogenesis. Similarly, antagonistic transcriptional 
regulation via either the products of the bHLH genes or three 
additional transcription factors—Olig1, Olig2, and Nkx2.1—influ- 
ence the generation of oligodendroglia. Continued antagonism 
between bHLH proteins, Notch signaling proteins, and the signal- 
ing molecule neuregulin (Nrg) is thought to influence the genera- 
tion of mature astrocytes. Finally, in the adult brain, cells adjacent 
to the ventricles (which apparently have avoided becoming dif- 
ferentiated) remain as ependymal cells. These may include a sub- 
population of neural stem cells (see Box 22A). (After Kintner, 2002.)

is; see Box 22D) and cell-cell interactions (i.e. who a cell's 
neighbors are) has been invoked to explain differentiation 
of neuronal and glial classes in the developing vertebrate 
brain. Many of the signaling molecules that are essential 
for the initial steps of neural induction and regionaliza- 
tion—BMPs, Sonic hedgehog, and Wnts, as well as Delta/ 
Notch—also influence the genesis of specific classes of 
neurons and glia via local cell-cell interactions. 
Among the targets of all of these pathways, different 
bHLH genes have emerged as central to subsequent dif- 
ferentiation of distinct neural or glial fates (see Figures 22.9 
and 22.10). There are multiple bHLH genes, and their re- 
stricted expression in distinct rudimentary brain regions ex- 
erts a powerful influence on cell identity in those domains 
(see Figure 22.10). Some of these bHLH genes are homo- 
logs of genes originally discovered in developing fruit flies, 
while others have been identified based on their predicted 
amino acid sequences inferred from genomic sequences. 
These molecular details of cell signaling and subsequent 
lineage relationships provide an outline of how general cell 
classes are established. Nevertheless, there is presently no 
clear and complete explanation for the means by which 
any specific neuronal class achieves its identity. This gap 
in knowledge presents a problem in using neural stem 
cells to generate replacements for specific cell classes lost 
to disease or injury, as well as to our efforts to understand 
how neural precursors can transform into the tumorogenic 
cells that cause medulloblastoma and other cancers of the 
nervous system. 
Molecular and Genetic Disruptions of 
Early Neural Development 
Our new awareness of the molecules involved in neural 
induction, neurogenesis, and the generation of neuro- 
nal diversity has led to a more informed way of thinking 
about the etiology of a number of congenital disorders of 
the nervous system. Anomalies such as spina bifida (fail- 
ure of the posterior neural tube to close completely), anen- 
cephaly (failure of the anterior neural tube to close at all), 
holoprosencephaly (disrupted regional differentiation of the 
forebrain), and other brain malformations can result from 
environmental insults that disrupt inductive signaling, and 
from the mutation of genes that participate in this process. 
Maternal dietary insufficiency of substances such as folic 
acid can disrupt embryonic neural tube formation by com- 
promising cellular mechanisms essential for DNA replica- 
tion and for normal cell division and motility. Conversely, 
excessive maternal intake of vitamin A—the metabolic 
precursor of retinoic acid—can impede neural tube closure 
and differentiation, or it can disrupt later aspects of neuro- 
nal differentiation due to an excess of ectopic RA signaling 
(see Box 22C), Embryonic exposure to a variety of other 
drugs—alcohol and thalidomide are notable examples— 
can also elicit pathological differentiation of the embryonic 
nervous system by providing or blocking inductive signals 
at inappropriate times or places.* Altered cholesterol me- 
tabolism can compromise Sonic hedgehog signaling be- 
cause cholesterol molecules play a role in modulating the 
interaction of Shh with its receptor, Patched. Such meta- 
bolic disruptions, as well as rare mutations in the human 
SHH gene, are associated with a small proportion of the re- 
corded cases of holoprosencephaly. Mutations in the genes 
for Shh and other proteins in the Shh pathway—particu- 
larly Patched—are also associated with the most prevalent 
childhood brain tumor, medulloblastoma (Box 22E). 
Some forms of hydrocephalus (a condition in which im- 
peded flow of cerebrospinal fluid increases pressure and 
results in enlarged ventricles and eventual cortical atrophy 
from compression) can be traced to mutations of genes on 
the X chromosome, especially those for the L1 cell adhesion 
molecule (see Chapter 23). Similarly, fragile-X syndrome, 
the most common form of congenital mental retardation in 
males, is associated with triplet repeats in a subset of genes 
on the X chromosome, particularly the gene for "fragile-X 
protein," which is involved in stabilizing dendritic processes 
and synapses. 
Some disorders that compromise the nervous system 
reflect single-gene mutations in homeobox-like transcrip- 
tion factors. Aniridia (characterized by loss of the iris in the 
eye and mild mental retardation) and Waardenburg syn- 
drome (characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, spina 
bifida, and hearing loss) are the result of mutations in the 
PAX6 and PAX3 genes, respectively, both of which encode 
transcription factors. Finally, some cases of developmental 
disorders such as autism and other severe social or learn- 
ing impairments have been linked to mutations in specific 
genes (including some of the Wnt family), as well as to 
microdeletions or duplications of specific chromosomal 
regions. Perhaps the best-known example of this class of 
neurodevelopmental disorders is Down's syndrome, or tri- 
somy 21, which is caused by the duplication of part or all 
of chromosome 21, usually due to failure of meiosis during 
the final stages of oogenesis. This duplication results in 
three copies of all the genes on chromosome 21. Although 
the connections between this aberrant gene dosage and 
the resulting anomalies of neural induction, patterning, 
and neurogenesis are not yet understood, such correla- 
tions provide a starting point for exploring the molecular 
pathogenesis of many congenital disorders of the nervous 
system. ee

* Because the consequences of disordered neural induction are so 
severe, pregnant women are advised to avoid virtually all drugs 
and dietary supplements except those specifically prescribed bya 
physician, especially during the first trimester. 

BOX 22E Triple Jeopardy: Diseases Associated with Sonic Hedgehog 
_ Many molecules that are essential 
_ 
for early nervous system pattern- 
ing and morphogenesis—such as the 
signaling molecule Sonic hedgehog, 
or SHH—have odd names and, at 
_ 
first glance, even more arcane func- 
tions. Nevertheless, mutations in the 
human genes for SHH and related 
signaling proteins are associated 
with at least three serious disorders. 
Holoprosencephaly disrupts the initial 
morphogenesis of two distinct cerebral 
hemispheres; medulloblastoma is the 
result of cancerous transformation of 
cerebellar granule neuron precursor 
cells; and basal cell carcinoma is the most 
prevalent cancer of the skin, commonly 
seen in fair-skinned adults of middle 
age or older. While the three disorders 
affect distinct cellular targets (neural 
plate cells, cerebellar precursors, and 
basal epidermal cells, respectively), each 
of them can be caused by mutations in 
(A) 
Normal 
Holoprosencephaly 
the SHH gene or in genes that encode 
the related receptors and signaling pro- 
teins patched (PTC) and smoothened 
(SMO).* 
Holoprosencephaly 
Holoprosencephaly occurs in approxi- 
mately 1 in every 16,000 live births and 
is the most common malformation of 
the mammalian forebrain known. It 
compromises the normal separation of 
the two hemispheres of the forebrain 
and can disrupt development of midline 
facial structures (Figure A); especially 
common is the failure of the eye pri- 
mordium to split into two bilaterally 
symmetrical fields and the subsequent 
development of a single eye (cyclopia). 
Holoprosencephaly has a broad range 
of phenotypes, from mildly affected 
individuals to embryonic lethality 
accompanied by early spontaneous 
abortion or stillbirth; in fact, this disor- 
der accounts for approximately 1 in 250 
stillbirths. 
A small but consistent proportion of 
holoprosencephaly cases are associated 
with deletions or missense mutations 
in SHH on chromosome 7. Most of 
these mutations are sporadic (i.e., they 
arise spontaneously rather than being 
genetically inherited from a parent). 
Many cases reflect either microdele- 
tions in the chromosomal region that 
includes SHH, or point mutations that 
cause missense transcripts of the gene, 
thus disrupting protein structure and 
function. Significant support for the 
association of the SHH genomic lesion 
with holoprosencephaly in humans 
comes from studies of mice in which 
the Shh gene has been inactivated 
*Note that, per convention, gene names

("knocked out") and from zebrafish, 
in which a number of mutant alleles 
of Shh have been identified. In each 
instance, loss of Shh protein func- 
tion results in the failure of forebrain 
hemisphere formation and in midline 
facial defects, including the cyclopean 
eye that characterizes the most severe 
forms of holoprosencephaly. Thus, 
one of the initial obligate functions 
of Sonic hedgehog—whose absence 
is not easily compensated for when 
the gene is inactivated—appears to be 
guiding the formation of the two cere- 
bral hemispheres as well as bilaterally 
symmetrical facial structures. 
Medulloblastoma 
Even though it is the most common 
childhood brain tumor, medulloblas- 
toma is fortunately quite rare, with 
an estimated population frequency 
between 1 in 50,000 and 1 in 100,000 
births. There is a 60% survival rate; 
however, surviving children are seri- 
ously compromised by the surgical and 
medical treatment necessary to prevent 
the growth of the tumor. 
The pathogenesis of medulloblas- 
tomas subverts normal neurogenesis 
and cell migration in the cerebellum. 
Normally, a large number of cerebel- 
lar granule neurons are generated by 
precursors that migrate to the outside 
surface of the developing cerebellum, 
generating postmitotic neuroblasts that 
then migrate back past the Purkinje 
cells to their adult location (Figure B). 
Purkinje cells normally produce Sonic 
hedgehog, which acts as a mitogen 
to drive granule cell precursor divi- 
sion. This basic mechanism of granule 
cell genesis, along with the molecular 
pathology of medulloblastoma, led to 
the hypothesis that this devastating 
childhood tumor reflects altered SHH 
signaling. Most medulloblastoma cells 
have elevated levels of Gli1 (an onco- 
gene product, so named because it is

found at elevated levels in various 
_ gliomas, or glial cell tumors), and Gli1 
levels are regulated by SHH signal- 
ing. Usually, binding of SHH to its 
receptor PTC (with the help of another 
SHH-regulated protein called SUFU) 
maintains low Gli levels, thus prevent- 
ing the transcription of Glil-regulated 
genes that drive cell proliferation. At 
least 9% of medulloblastoma patients 
have loss-of-function mutations in PTC, 
and an additional 9% have mutations 
in SUFU. The likely contribution of 
both these genes to the pathogenesis 
of medulloblastomas was confirmed by 
studies in mutant mice in which either 
the Ptc or Sufu gene was inactivated. 
These mutations, particularly when 
accompanied by mutations in other 
major tumor-suppressor genes, result 
in mice with medulloblastoma with 
varying frequency, depending upon the 
mutation. 
Basal cell carcinomas 
The final Sonic hedgehog-associated 
disorder, basal cell carcinomas of the 
skin, are by far the most common 
malady associated with this multifac- 
eted developmental signaling pathway. 
In the United States alone, there are 
at least 750,000 new basal cell carci- 
nomas each year. A subset of basal 
cell carcinomas (which, because they 
are local neoplasms, are studied for 
somatic mutations in the tumor cells 
themselves rather than for heritable 
mutations in the individual) have 
mutations in either SHH (rare), SMO 
(rare), or PTC (very common). Once 
again, the use of mouse mutants con- 
firmed the likely contribution of these 
genes to basal cell carcinoma patho- 
genesis. Moreover, basal carcinoma 
cells, when cultured, are responsive to 
manipulation of Shh signaling. Finally, 
and perhaps most intriguingly, a rare 
Neen 
case 
autosomal dominant syndrome called 
nevoid basal carcinoma, or Gorlin syn- 
drome, is caused by loss-of-function 
mutations in the PTC gene. Aside 
. 
from a high incidence of basal cell 
carcinoma, these patients also have 
a significantly increased incidence of 
medulloblastoma. 
Taken together, these observations 
indicate the central contributions of 
a seemingly obscure developmental 
signaling pathway to a number of dis- 
orders that, at first glance, might seem 
completely unrelated. The contrast 
between the morphogenetic effects 
of loss of SHH function (holoprosen- 
cephaly) versus disregulation of cell 
proliferation or differentiation (medul- 
loblastoma and basal cell carcinoma) 
indicates how different tissue contexts 
can result in very different functions for 
the same molecules—and in very differ- 
ent pathologies when those functions 
are disrupted. The association of SHH 
signaling with these three diseases has 
led to new therapeutic approaches, 
especially for medulloblastoma and 
basal cell carcinomas. In particular, 
small-molecule inhibitors of SMO, 
which normally promotes GLI1 stability 
and nuclear translocation unless inhib- 
ited by PTC in the absence of SHH, are 
currently in development. These inhibi- 
tors show some promise as therapeutic 
agents.

Neuronal Migration in the Peripheral 
Nervous System 
Cell migration, a ubiquitous feature in the embryo, brings 
distinct classes of cells into appropriate spatial relationships 
within differentiating tissues. In the developing nervous 
system, migration brings different classes of neurons to- 
gether so that they can interact, and it insures the final posi- 
tion of many postmitotic neurons. The capacity of a neural 
precursor or an immature nerve cell to move and the path 
of its transit through a changing cellular environment are 
essential for its subsequent differentiation. The final loca- 
tion of a postmitotic neuron is presumably especially criti- 
cal, since neural function depends on precise connections 
made by these cells and their targets. The developing neu- 
ron must be in the right place at the right time so that it 
can be properly integrated into a functional circuit that can 
mediate behavior. 
As is the case for inductive events during initial forma- 
tion of the nervous system, stereotyped movements during 
neuronal migration bring different classes of cells into con- 
tact with one another (often transiently), thereby providing 
a means of constraining cell-cell signaling to specific times 
and places. Such effects are most thoroughly documented 
for the migration and differentiation of neural crest cells 
from the neural tube to the periphery of the embryo; these

particular migratory paths are influenced by the initial posi- 
tions of the neural crest cells at distinct anterior—posterior 
locations in the neural tube. Their initial positional identity 
is reflected in the final locations of neural crest cells from 
various anterior—posterior levels in distinct parts of the body 
(Figure 22.11A). Thus, the final fates of neural crest cells— 
including becoming sensory, sympathetic, parasympathetic 
and enteric neurons of the peripheral nervous system—is

dency for subsets of neurons to wander 
came in the late 1960s with a report

diencephalon, were actually generated 
in the telencephalon. This observa- 
tion received little notice until the mid 
1980s, when a series of experiments 
using chick—quail chimeras suggested 
that a major portion of granule cells in 
the cerebellum (small local circuit neu- 
rons) were actually generated outside 
the rhombencephalon (the embryonic 
region associated with the genera- 
tion of the cerebellum). Most of these 
extrinsic cells were thought to migrate 
from the mesencephalon (associated 
with the generation of the superior and 
inferior colliculus in the adult brain) 
into the external granule cell layer of 
the cerebellum. Together, these find- 
ings implied that adult brain structures 
might be derived from a broad range of 
embryonic brain subdivisions. 
At around the same time, sev- 
' 
eral investigators noticed a small but 
consistent proportion of cells in the 
cerebral cortex whose migratory route

22.12). These observations were the 
focus of a lively debate that neverthe- 
less failed to explain the significance of 
the apparent "escapees" from the radial 
migration framework in the developing 
cortex. Moreover, lineage analysis sug- 
gested that cortical projection neurons, 
interneurons, astrocytes, and oligoden- 
droglia were probably not derived from 
the same precursor pools (see Figure 
22.10). There was little consensus about 
these disparate observations until the 
mid 1990s, when several groups real- 
ized that there was a massive migration 
of cells from the ventral forebrain—the 
region of the ganglionic eminence that 
gives rise to the caudate, putamen, 
and globus pallidus—to the cerebral 
cortex (Figure A). Moreover, these 
ventrally derived cells were not just 
any cell types; they constituted distinct 
classes of GABAergic interneurons in 
the cortex and olfactory bulb, as well as 
oligodendroglia throughout the entire 
forebrain. Newly generated granule 
and periglomular interneurons in the 
mature olfactory bulb are derived from 
a remnant of the ganglionic eminence 
called the anterior subventricular zone, 
which persists at the surface of the 
mature lateral ventricles. 
A mosaic of transcriptional regula- 
tors whose expression and activity is 
restricted to various domains in the 
ventral forebrain orchestrates this long- 
distance migration of distinct cell types 
(Figure B). When subsets of these tran- 
scription factors are mutated, migra- 
tion of cells from the ventral forebrain 
to the cortex is dramatically dimin- 
ished (Figure C), and the numbers of 
GABAergic interneurons is similarly 
reduced. The mechanisms for specifying

that the appropriate population can be 
critically dependent on the proper exit of neural crest cells 
from the epithelium of the neural tube, and on their sub- 
sequent proper migration through terrain that provides in- 
structive as well as trophic signals. 
The neural crest arises from the dorsal neural tube along 
the entire length of the spinal cord and hindbrain (see Fig- 
ure 22.2). Thus, as neural crest cells begin their journeys, 
they carry with them information about their point of ori- 
gin, including expression of distinct Hox genes (see Figure 
22.4C) that are limited to various spinal cord and hindbrain 
domains. Regardless of where they originate, all neural crest 
cells must undergo an essential transition in order to be- 
gin migration. They all begin as neuroepithelial cells, with 
all of the intercellular junctions and adhesive interactions 
that keep epithelial cells in place. To move, then, neural 
crest cells must downregulate expression of these adhesive 
genes and undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transi- 
tion (epithelial cells being bound in a sheet, mesenchymal 
cells being loosely packed and tending to migrate freely). 
Presumptive neural crest cells express several transcription 
factors, including the bHLH family members Snail1 and 
Snail2 (Figure 22.11B), which repress expression of intercel- 
lular junctional proteins and epithelial adhesion molecules. 
This process of delamination and migration in the neu- 
ral crest is similar to the process of metastasis when trans- 
formed oncogenic cells escape their epithelial confines, as- 
sume a mesenchymal character, and are able to migrate 
freely (with grave pathological consequences). Indeed, 
some of the genes that modulate delamination in the neural

crest—particularly the Snail genes—can become oncogenes 
if mutations arise that allow them to be expressed in ma- 
ture epithelial tissues. When motile neural crest cells reach 
their final destinations, they cease to express Snail and 
other transcription factors that induce the mesenchymal, 
migratory state. This change is thought to reflect the in- 
tegration of a number of signals the cells encounter along 
their migratory route. Understanding this normal event 
has implications for cancer biology, since inducing trans- 
formed, migratory cancerous cells to revert to a stationary 
state would have clear therapeutic value. 
Neural crest cells are largely guided along distinct migra- 
tory pathways by signals from non-neural peripheral struc- 
tures such as somites (which eventually form the axial mus- 
cles and skeleton) and other rudimentary musculoskeletal 
or visceral tissues. The signals along these pathways can 
be secreted molecules (including some of the same pep- 
tide hormones used at earlier times for neural induction), 
cell surface ligands and receptors (adhesion molecules and 
other signals), or extracellular matrix molecules; most of 
these molecules also are used at later stages of develop- 
ment to guide axonal growth and targeting, as described 
in Chapter 23. Thus, the surfaces of cells in the embryonic 
periphery display specialized adhesion molecules in the 
extracellular matrix, such as laminin or fibronectin, or ad- 
hesion molecules, such as neural cadherin (N-cadherin), 
neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), or the eph recep- 
tors and their ligands, the ephrins (see Figure 22.11B; see 
also Chapter 23). In addition, secreted signals including 

502 
CHAPTER 22 
neurotrophic molecules may influence neural crest cell mi- 
eration. Of particular significance is the fact that specific 
peptide hormone growth factors available in particular pe- 
ripheral targets cause neural crest cells to differentiate into 
distinct phenotypes (Figure 22.11C). These cues modulate 
the expression of bHLH genes in neural crest cells during 
the transition from migratory precursor to postmitotic neu- 
roblast. Thus, the balance of migratory capacity, instructive 
cues, and modification of gene expression seen during the 
transit of the neural crest from the neural tube to the pe- 
riphery illustrates the influence of migration on the estab- 
lishment of neuronal identity. 
Neuronal Migration in the Central 
Nervous System 
Neuronal migration is not limited to the periphery. Neu- 
rons generated in several locations in the central nervous 
system must also move from the site of their initial genesis 
to a distant site, where they differentiate and are integrated 
into mature neural circuits. The mechanisms of central neu- 
ronal migration are diverse, and its successful completion is 
essential for many aspects of normal brain function. 
A minority of nerve and glial cells in the central nervous 
system (and a few in the periphery) use existing axon path- 
ways as migratory guides. These include subsets of cranial 
nerve nuclei in the hindbrain; nuclei in the pons that project 
to the cerebellum; Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral 
axons; and a small population of neurons that migrate dur- 
ing embryonic development from the olfactory epithelium 
in the nose to the hypothalamus, where they secrete go- 
nadotropir-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is essential 
for regulating reproductive functions in the mature animal. 
The most prominent form of neuroblast migration 
within the central nervous system, however, is that guided 
by glial cells. Many neuroblasts that migrate long distances 
within the central nervous system—including those in the 
cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus—are guided 
to their final destinations by following the long processes 
of radial glia (or similar glia in the cerebellum called Berg- 
mann glia). Radial glial cells have multiple functions in the 
developing brain. In addition to acting as migratory guides, 
they are currently thought to be neuronal progenitor cells 
in the developing central nervous system (see Figure 22.7 
and Chapter 25).

Section through the developing forebrain showing radial glial 
processes from the ventricular to the pial surfaces. Migrating 
neurons are intimately apposed to radial glial cells, which guide 
them to their final position in the cortex. Some cells take a non- 
radial migratory route, which can lead to wide dispersion of 
neurons derived from the same precursor (see Box 22F). (B) Time-

Histological observations of embryonic brains made by 
Wilhelm His and Ramon y Cajal during the nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries suggested that neuroblasts 
in the developing cerebral cortical hemispheres followed 
glial guides to their final locations (Figure 22.12A). These 
light microscopic observations were supported by analyses 
of electron microscopic images of fixed tissue in the 1960s 
and 1970s as well as molecular labeling that identified the 
radial glial cells and migrating neurons as distinct cell classes 
(Figure 22.12B). More recent in vivo microscopic observation 
has confirmed these inferences, and also has shown that 
radial glia do indeed serve dual functions, being both stem 
cells and migration guides. The apparent scaffold for radial 
movement of postmitotic neurons established by the radial 
glia fits well with the orderly relationship between birthdates 
and final position of distinct cell types in the cerebral cortex 
as well as the cerebellum (see Figure 22.8 and Box 22D). By 
adhering to the glial process, a cell can move past dividing 
cells in the ventricular and subventricular zone as well as 
already differentiating neurons in lower cortical layers (lay- 
ers 5 and 6, for example) toward the cortical surface, where 
it will contact the endfeet of radial glial cells and disengage 
from the glial surface. In the cerebellum, the direction of 
this process is reversed. The precursors for cerebellar granule 
cells are actually on the cerebellar surface, and the processes 
of Bergmann glia guide postmitotic granule cells past the 
already generated Purkinje cells into the nascent internal 
granule cell layer. Thus, glial-guided migration appears to 
ensure translocation of newly generated neurons past other 
neurons already in place in the developing nervous system. 
Molecular Mechanisms of Neuronal 
Migration and Cortical Migration 
Disorders 
Increased understanding of molecular mechanisms and 
direct observation of migrating neurons and their glial 
guides in live developing brains indicate that the process 
of neuronal migration, particularly in the cortex, may be 
vulnerable to the effects of genetic mutations that disrupt 
either the ability of the nerve cell to move, the ability of 
radial glial cells to support migration, or both. This infer- 
ence received initial support from the characterization of 
several single-gene mutants in the mouse that disrupted 
the orderly placement of neurons based on their time of 
origin. Subsequent work has identified several proteins 
whose function is vital for normal migration along ra- 
dial glia. Some of these proteins are found on the sur- 
face or in the cytoplasm of the migrating neuron itself; 
others are found on the glial cell surface (Figure 22.13A). 
When the function of any of these proteins is disrupted, 
neurogenesis, migration, and cortical lamination can be 
compromised. 
EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT 
503 
A particularly compelling demonstration of the reli- 
ance of cortical neurogenesis and migration on specific 
genes and their protein products has come from analysis 
of human patients with a variety of brain malformations 
that can be visualized using magnetic resonance imag- 
ing (Figure 22.13B-D). Genetic analysis of these patients 
has identified mutations in several genes that can disrupt 
cortical migration. In some cases (such as that of the mole- 
cule Reelin, which is available near the glial endfeet and is 
thought to influence the detachment of neurons from the 
radial glia; see Figure 22.13A), mutations in humans result 
in a cortical phenotype very similar to that seen in mice in 
which the analogous gene is experimentally deleted (see 
Figure 22.13C). In patients with lissencephaly—"smooth 
brain," a condition in which the cortex has no sulci or gyri 
(Figure 22.13D)—several novel genes have been identi- 
fied, including lissencephaly 1 or LIS1 and doublecortin, or 
DCX. The LIS1 protein interacts with the cellular motor 
protein dynein, and mutations may disrupt dynein-medi- 
ated aspects of cell division in cortical progenitors or or- 
ganelle transport in migrating cortical neurons. The DCX 
protein interacts with microtubules in migrating neurons 
and is thought to influence both the integrity of the cy- 
toskeleton in these cells and the appropriate transport of 
organelles during initial differentiation. In other patients, 
including those with "small brains" or microcephaly, 
other genes are mutated (including those for the mitotic 
spindle-associated protein ASPM and the protein kinase 
CDK5RAP2), leading to reduced neurogenesis as well as 
altered migration. 
Neuropathological observations as well as molecular 
and genetic studies have confirmed that several neurologi- 
cal problems, including epilepsy and some forms of mental 
retardation, arise from the abnormal migration of cerebral 
cortical neurons. Several additional molecules that influ- 
ence cell-cell signaling or cell adhesion are associated with 
disorders that are thought to reflect, in part, disrupted neu- 
ronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex. In partic- 
ular, neuregulin (a secreted signal), the neural cell adhesion 
molecule NCAM, and DISC1 (a gene mutated or deleted 
in a small number of cases of schizophrenia) are highly as- 
sociated with risk for psychiatric diseases. Thus, disrupted 
cell migration (and its consequences for subsequent devel- 
opment of brain synapses and circuits) may underlie the 
pathology of several serious brain disorders. 
Summary 
The initial development of the nervous system depends 
on an intricate interplay of inductive signals and cellular 
movements. In addition to the early establishment of re- 
gional identity and cellular position in the brain, substan- 
tial migration of neuronal precursors is necessary for the 
subsequent differentiation of distinct classes of neurons, as

events depend on the same categories of molecular and 
cellular phenomena: cell-cell signaling, changes in motility 
and adhesion, transcriptional regulation, and, ultimately, 
cell-specific changes in gene expression. The molecules that 
participate in signaling during early brain development are 
the same as the signals used by mature cells: hormones, 
transcription factors, and second messengers (see Chapter 

7), as well as cell adhesion molecules. The identification and 
characterization of these molecules in the developing brain 
has begun to explain a variety of congenital neurological 
defects, as well as providing initial insight into the genetic 
and cellular basis of a number of developmental disorders. 
These associations with brain pathologies likely reflect the 
vulnerability of signaling and transcriptional regulation 
during early neural development to the effects of genetic 
mutations, as well as to the actions of the many drugs and 
other chemicals that can compromise the elaboration of a 
normal nervous system.

Overview 
ONCE NERVE CELLS HAVE BEEN GENERATED, groups of neurons must become 
interconnected to form the neural circuits that mediate brain function. The first step 
in this process is to establish axons and dendrites in the newly generated neurons. 
The initial distinction of the characteristic single axon from the multiple dendrites of 
a neuron depends on cellular polarization, a process that reflects interactions among 
proteins found on different regions of a neuron's cytoskeleton. Once established, 
axons grow to reach appropriate target cells, which can be local or distant, and be- 
gin to make the synaptic connections that will form neural circuits. The directed 
erowth of axons and recognition of appropriate synaptic targets depends on growth 
cones—the specialized endings of growing axons. The dynamic behavior of growth 
cones depends in turn on adhesive, attractive, and repulsive signals in the embryonic 
environment. Once axons find their way to appropriate targets and form synapses, 
molecular neurotrophic factors influence neuron survival. In many regions of the 
developing nervous system, the death of some neurons helps match the numbers 
of innervating neurons to the needs of the target group. Neurotrophic and other 
signals also regulate the subsequent growth of axons and dendrites and the addition 
of synapses to match the strength of connections to target and circuit needs. As in 
other instances of intercellular communication, a variety of receptors and second 
messenger molecules transduce adhesion and neurotrophic signals as synapses and 
circuits mature. These cellular mechanisms establish topographic maps and other 
orderly representations of information underlying the complex neural circuits that 
allow animals to behave in increasingly sophisticated ways as they mature. 
Neuronal Polarization: The First Step 
in Neural Circuit Formation 
Neurons are especially elaborate examples of polarized epithelial cells, a funda- 
mental cell class found in most tissues. Epithelial cells assemble into sheets that 
absorb molecules from the environment in one domain and secrete proteins and 
other cell products in another (Figure 23.1A). The tissues of the gut, lung, kidney, 
and pancreas are all epithelial cell sheets enclosing lumens from which molecules

constitute the cellular cytoskeleton (Figure 23.1B). Because 
neurons are highly specialized epithelial cells, a first step 
in their development is distinguishing the apical domain

cialized for receiving signals) (Figure 23.1C).

since at first they have neither axonal nor dendritic identi- 
intercellular communication. Junctions that hold epithelial 
ties) protrude from the immature neuron. Soon after, mi- 
cells together are found on this surface, as are ion channels, 
crotubule and actin components of the cytoskeleton as well 
small signaling molecules, and the machinery for intercel- 
as other proteins are redistributed among the neurites so

axons and dendrites. (A) Apical/basal distinctions in a simple 
epithelium. The apical domain has a distinctive actin cytoskel- 
eton and membrane extensions (villi); there are tight junctions; 
the Golgi apparatus is oriented toward the apical membrane: 
secretory vesicles fuse; and vesicular endocytosis targets endo- 
somal compartments within the cell. The basolateral domain 
makes contact with the extracellular matrix; it has specialized 
adhesion contacts; and the plus ends of microtubules are orient- 
ed toward the basal membrane, which is the site of endosomal 
traffic. (B) Image of a simple polarized epithelial tube. The red

basal domain). A number of studies, initially done in cell 
culture and more recently confirmed in developing em- 
bryos, indicate that several proteins, particularly members 
of the PAR family, are distributed preferentially in the na- 
scent axon (Figure 23.1D). (PAR stands for "partitioning- 
defective"; PAR proteins were originally identified in the 
worm C, elegans based on their control of the axis of cell 
division and distribution of daughter cell proteins.) These 
proteins interact with cytoskeletal elements and signaling 
molecules, including Rho and other protein kinases; sig- 
nal transduction molecules activated by secreted Wnts (see 
Chapter 22); neurotrophins; and cell surface-bound cell ad- 
hesion molecules. When the function of PAR proteins or re- 
lated signaling molecules is disrupted, the specification of a 
single axon does not occur (see Figure 23.1D). PAR proteins 
and other polarity regulators also play a role in defining the 
regions of dendrites that receive synapses. In sum, in de- 
veloping neurons, the molecular mechanisms that establish 
epithelial cell polarity are adapted to generate axons and 
dendrites, which in turn grow and travel, eventually making 
the connections that define a neural circuit. 
The Axon Growth Cone 
Once the axon has been specified, it navigates over millime- 
ters or even centimeters, through complex embryonic ter- 
rain, to find appropriate synaptic partners. In 1910, Ross G. 
Harrison first observed this phenomenon in a living tadpole 
and wrote, "The growing fibers are clearly endowed with 
considerable energy and have the power to make their way 
through the solid or semi-solid protoplasm of the cells of 
the neural tube. But we are at present in the dark with re- 
gard to the conditions which guide them to specific points." 
Morte recent efforts, using increasingly sophisticated vital 
dyes and optical techniques with improved resolution in 
living specimens, have confirmed Harrison's initial descrip- 
tion of the remarkable navigation of growing axons through 
the embryo (Figure 23.2A). In addition, it is now clear that 
dendrites, especially primary dendrites such as those of

processes elongate (middle right). The axon-specific cytoskeleton 
protein Tau (red; bottom left) is usually seen only in the single 
developing axon. When Par-3 function is disrupted, Tau is seen 
in all of the neurites. (B courtesy of Natalie Elia and Jennifer

cortical pyramidal cells or cerebellar Purkinje cells, must 
also extend over relatively long distances. The manner in 
which they do so is similar to that of axons. 
Harrison recognized two fundamental features of axonal 
growth that continue to motivate efforts to understand the 
assembly of neural circuits. First, the "considerable energy 
... and power" of growing axons reflect the cellular proper- 
ties of the growth cone, a specialized structure at the tip of 
the extending axon. Growth cones are highly motile. They 
explore the extracellular environment, determine the direc- 
tion of growth, and then guide the extension of the axon in 
that direction. The primary morphological characteristic of 
a growth cone is a sheetlike expansion of the growing axon 
at its tip called a lamellipodium. When growth cones are 
examined in vitro, lamellipodia can be seen clearly, as can 
numerous fine processes called filopodia that extend from 
each lamellipodium (Figure 23.2B). Filopodia rapidly form 
and disappear from the terminal expansion, like fingers 
reaching out to sense the environment. The lamellipodium 
and filopodia are distinguished from the axon shaft by dif- 
ferent cytoskeletal molecules (see Figure 23.1B and the fol- 
lowing section). Thus, the growth cone is a distinct, if tran- 
sient, neuronal specialization whose activity is critical for 
the formation of tracts and circuits in the developing brain. 
Once a growth cone reaches and recognizes an appropriate 
target—relying upon cues or "conditions which guide them 
to specific points" that Harrison rightly stated were "in the 
dark" and remained so until late in the last century—it is 
gradually transformed into either a presynaptic ending for 
an axon or the terminal domain of a dendrite. 
Santiago Ramon y Cajal, a contemporary of Harrison's, 
observed in sections of fixed specimens that growth cones 
in several established axon pathways—pathways presum- 
ably "pioneered" by one or a few early growing axons— 
tend to be simple in shape. In contrast, when a pioneer 
axon (i.e., the first axon to extend through a given region, 
thus establishing that terrain as hospitable to axon growth) 
extends in a new direction through a territory not previ- 
ously innervated, or reaches a region where a choice must

"decision" regions. In this example, from the 
drawings of Santiago Ramon y Cajal, growth 
cones from sensory relay neurons in the dorsal 
spinal cord are relatively simple near their origin 
("C" in this drawing). They change their shape as 
they approach and cross the ventral midline (a 
major decision point) to form the spinothalamic 
tract ("A" and "B"). Once across the midline, 
they reassume the simpler morphology. (A from

be made about which direction to take, the growth cone 
changes dramatically (Figure 23.2C). The lamellipodium of 
the growth cone expands as it encounters a potential tar- 
get and extends numerous filopodia, actions that suggest 
an active search for appropriate cues to direct subsequent 
growth. These changes of growth cone shape at "decision 
points" have been observed in both the peripheral and cen- 
tral nervous systems. In the periphery, the growth cones 
of both motor and sensory neurons change shape as they 
enter the developing muscles of immature limbs, presum- 
ably facilitating the selection of appropriate targets in the 
musculature. Growth cones in all axon pathways examined 
thus far (including the olfactory nerve, optic chiasm, and 
cerebral commissures) change shape when they reach criti- 
cal points in their trajectories (Box 23A). 
The Molecular Basis of 
Growth Cone Motility 
Growth cone motility reflects rapid, controlled rearrange- 
ment of the cytoskeleton. The force to move the axon is 
generated by ATP-dependent modification of the actin 
(C) 
and microtubule cytoskeletons. The actin cytoskeleton 
regulates changes in lamellipodial and filopodial shape 
for directed growth, while the microtubule cytoskeleton 
is responsible for the elongation of the axon itself (Figure 
23.3A,B). The molecular composition of both the actin and 
microtubule cytoskeletons changes in distinct regions of the 
growing axon, suggesting a great deal of dynamism within 
growing neural processes (Figure 23.3B,C). Thus, the ways 
in which the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are modi- 
fied in growing axons are key to understanding how growth 
cones and axons extend. 
Actin is the primary molecular constituent of a network 
of cellular filaments found in the lamellipodia and filopodia 
of growth cones. Tubulin is the primary molecular constitu- 
ent of the microtubules that run parallel to the axis of the 
axon and give it both structural integrity and a means for 
transporting proteins from the nerve cell body to the axon 
terminal (axons do not contain significant protein synthe- 
sis machinery). Actin and tubulin are found in two forms 
in the growth cone and axon: freely soluble monomers in 
the cytoplasm, and polymers that form filaments (actin) or 
microtubules (tubulin). The dynamic polymerization and 
depolymerization of actin at the membrane of the lamelli- 
podium, as well as within the filopodium, sets the direction 
of growth cone movement, in part by generating local forces

CHAPTER 23 
_ The functional requirement that a 
_ subset of axons from retinal ganglion 
_ cells in each eye must cross while the 
_ remaining axons project to the ipsilater- 
_ al side of the brain was predicted based 
on optical principles—most notably by 
_ Sir Isaac Newton in the seventeenth 
century—and confirmed (much later) 
by neuroanatomists and neurophysi- 
ologists (see Chapter 12). The partial 
crossing, or decussation, of retinal axons 
is most striking in primates, including 
humans, where approximately half of 
the axons cross and the other half do 
not. Although all other mammals also 
have crossed and uncrossed retinal pro- 
jections, the percentage of uncrossed 
axons diminishes from 20%-30% in 
carnivores to less than 5% in most 
rodents. The frequency of uncrossed 
axons decreases even more in other 
vertebrates; thus, in amphibians, fish, 
and birds most or all of the retinal pro- 
jection is crossed. For both functional 
and evolutionary reasons, the partial 
decussation of the retinal pathways and 
its variable extent in different species 
has engaged the imagination of biolo- 
gists and others interested in vision. 
For developmental neurobiologists, 
this phenomenon raises an obvious 
question: How do retinal ganglion cells 
"choose sides" such that some project 
contralaterally and others ipsilaterally? 
This question is central to understand- 
ing how the peripheral visual projection 
is organized to construct two accurate 
visual hemifield maps that superimpose 
points of space seen jointly by the two 
eyes (see Chapter 12). It also speaks 
to the more general issue in neural 
development of how axons distinguish 
between ipsilateral and contralateral 
targets. 
It is clear that the laterality of reti- 
nal axons is determined by initial cell 
identity and axon guidance mechanisms 
rather than by regressive processes that 
subsequently select or sculpt these pro- 
jections. Thus, the distinction between 
the nasal and temporal retinal regions 
that project ipsilaterally and contra- 
laterally is already apparent in the 
retina—as well as in axon trajectories at 
BOX 23A Choosing Sides: Axon Guidance at the Optic Chiasm 
the midline and in the developing optic 
tract—long before the axons reach their 
targets. In the retina, this specificity is 
seen as a "line of decussation," or bor- 
der, between ipsilaterally and contralat- 
erally projecting retinal ganglion cells. 
The line of decussation can be 
detected experimentally by injecting a 
retrograde tracer into the nascent optic 
tract of very young embryos. In the reti- 
nas of such embryos, there is a distinct 
boundary between the population of 
retinal ganglion cells projecting ipsilat- 
erally in one eye (found in the temporal 
retina), as well as a complementary 
boundary for contralaterally projecting 
cells in the other eye (see the figure). A 
molecular basis for this specificity was 
initially suggested by studies of albino 
mammals, including mice and humans. 
In albinos, where single gene mutation 
disrupts melanin synthesis throughout 
the animal, including in the pigment 
epithelium of the retina, the ipsilateral 
component of the retinal projection 
(A) A small population of Zic2- 
expressing retinal ganglion cells 
(arrowheads) is seen in the ventro- 
temporal region of the normal retina 
(at left, mounted flat by making sev- 
eral radial cuts). At right, the normal 
projection of one eye via the optic 
nerve (ON), through the optic chiasm 
(OC), and into the optic tract (OT) has 
been traced using a lipophilic dye 
placed in one eye. After the chiasm, 
labeled axons can be seen both in the 
contralateral (contra) as well as the 
ipsilateral (ipsi) optic tract. (B) When 
Zic2 function is diminished in a mouse 
heterozygous for a Zic2 "knockdown" 
mutation (in which expression of 
Zic2 protein is diminished, but not 
eliminated), the number of ipsilateral 
axons in the optic tract is similarly 
diminished. (C) When Zic2 function 
is further diminished in homozygous 
Zic2 knockdown mice, the ipsilateral 
projection can no longer be detected 
in the optic tract; thus, each of the 
optic tracts consist of contralateral 
axons. (From Herrera et al., 2003.) 
from each eye is dramatically reduced, 
the line of decussation in the retina is 
disrupted, and the distribution of glia 
and other cells in the vicinity of the 
optic chiasm is altered. These and other 
observations suggested that identity 
of retinal axons with respect to decus- 
sation is established in the retina, and 
further reinforced by axonal "choices" 
influenced by cues provided by cells 
within the optic chiasm. 
Analysis of growth cone cell mor- 
phologies has shown that the chiasm 
is indeed a region where growth cones 
explore the molecular environment in 
a particularly detailed way, presumably 
to make choices pertinent to directed 
growth. Furthermore, molecular analy- 
sis reveals specialized neuroepithelial 
cells in and around the chiasm that 
express a number of cell adhesion 
molecules associated with axon guid- 
ance. Interestingly, some of these mol- 
ecules—particularly netrins, slits, and 
their robo receptors—do not influence

decussation in the chiasm as they do 
at other regions of the nervous system. 
Instead, they are expressed in cells 
where the chiasm forms, apparently 
constraining its location on the ventral 
surface of the diencephalon. The estab- 
_ lishment of ipsilateral versus contralat- 
_ eral identity is evidently more depen- 
_ dent on the zinc finger transcription 
_ factor Zic2, as well as on cell adhesion 
_ molecules of the ephrin family. Zic2, 
_ which is expressed specifically in the 
temporal retina, is associated with the 
_ expression of a distinct receptor, EphB1, 
_ in the axons arising from temporal reti- 
nal ganglion cells. The ephrin B2 ligand, 
which is recognized as a repellent of 
EphB1 axons, is found in midline glial 
cells in the optic chiasm. In support of 
the functional importance of these mol- 
ecules, disrupting Zic2, EphB1, or ephrin 
B2 gene function diminishes the degree 
of ipsilateral projection in developing 
mice; in accord with this finding, nei- 
ther the Zic2 nor the ephrin B2 gene is 
expressed in vertebrate species that lack 
ipsilateral projections. 
These observations provide a molecu- 
lar framework for the identification of 
retinal ganglion cells and the sorting 
of their projections at the optic chiasm. 
How this sorting is related to the topog- 
raphy of tectal, thalamic, and cortical 
representations is not yet known. Most 
observations suggest that retinal topog- 
raphy is not faithfully preserved among 
axons in the optic tracts. The identity 
and position of axons from nasal and 
temporal retinas whose retinal gan- 
glion cells "see" a common point in 
the binocular hemifield must therefore 
be restored in the thalamus and subse- 
quently retained or reestablished in the 
thalamic projections to cortex. Choosing

establishing maps of visual space.

posttranslational modifications of monomeric and polym- 
erized tubulin. Other microtubule-binding proteins ("mo- 
tors") are essential for moving molecules and organelles 
("cargo") up and down neuronal processes. The interac- 
tion of these motor proteins with tubulin allows the axon 
to remain relatively stable in the face of the expanding 
exploration and growth of the growth cone. 
The constant flux between monomeric actin and tubulin 
versus the polymerized actin filaments and microtubules is 
regulated via binding proteins in response to signals from 
the environment. These signals are transduced by recep- 
tors and channels on the growth cone membrane surface, 
structures that influence the levels of intracellular messen- 
gers, particularly that of Ca"* (see Figure 23.3D). Indeed, the 
regulation of intracellular Ca** levels, either through volt- 
age-regulated Ca** channels, transient receptor potential 
(TRP) channels activated by second messengers, or second 
messenger pathways that mobilize intracellular Ca stores, 
is thought to be a major mediator of actin and microtu- 
bule dynamics in the growing axon. These fluctuations of 
Ca?* are quite localized in the growth cone—sometimes in 
a single filopodium (see Figure 23.3D)—and are thought to 
influence decisions on direction of growth. Thus, the condi- 
tions that Ross Harrison suggested "guide [growth cones] 
to specific points" are now understood to be changes in 
the cytoskeleton of the growth cone and axon, mediated 
by intracellular signal transduction in response to adhesion 
molecules and diffusible signals in the embryonic terrain 
through which the growth cone extends. 
Non-Diffusible Signals 
for Axon Guidance 
The complex behavior of growth cones during axon exten- 
sion suggests the presence of specific cues that cause the 
growth cone to move in a particular direction, and of an ar- 
ray of receptors and transduction mechanisms that respond 
to these cues. The identity of these cues remained elusive 
for nearly 75 years following Harrison and Cajal's initial 
observations, but over the past 30 years many of the rel- 
evant molecules have been established. The cues comprise 
a large group of molecules associated with cell adhesion 
and cell-cell recognition throughout the organism. These 
molecules initiate intracellular signaling cascades that can 
alter the actin or microtubule cytoskeleton, the complement 
of receptors and channels on the cell surface, or gene ex- 
pression. The association of specific cell adhesion molecules 
with axon growth is based on experiments either in vitro, 
where addition or removal of a particular molecule results 
in modifying the relevant behavior of growing axons; or 
in vivo, where genetic mutation, deletion, or manipulation 
disrupts the growth, guidance, or targeting of a particular 
axon pathway (see Box 23A). 
Even though there are a daunting number of them, the 
molecules known to influence axon growth and guidance 
can be grouped into families of ligands and their receptors 
(Figure 23.4). The major classes of non-diffusible axon guid- 
ance molecules are: the extracellular matrix molecules and 
their integrin receptors; the Ca**-independent cell adhesion 

514 
CHAPTER 23 
FIGURE 23.4 
Several families of ligands 
and receptors constitute the major 
classes of axon guidance molecules. These 
ligand-receptor pairs can be either attractive 
or repulsive, depending on the identity of the 
molecules and the context in which they signal 
the growth cone. (A) Extracellular matrix (ECM) 
molecules serve as the ligands for multiple inte- 
grin receptors. Integrins transduce ECM signals 
by interacting with cytoplasmic protein kinases 
and activating Ca?* channels. (B) Homophilic, 
Ca?+-independent cell adhesion molecules 
(CAMs) are at once ligands and receptors. 
Homophilic binding activates intracellular 
kinases, leading to cytoskeletal changes. (C) 
Ca?*-dependent adhesion molecules, or cad- 
herins, are also capable of homophilic binding. 
They signal via activation of B-catenin, which 
influences gene expression. (D) Ephrins, which 
can be either transmembrane or membrane- 
associated, signal via the Eph receptors, which 
are receptor tyrosine kinases. 
(C) Cadherins 
molecules (CAMs); the Ca**-dependent 
cell adhesion molecules, or cadherins; and 
the ephrins and Eph receptors. 
The extracellular matrix cell adhe- 
sion molecules were the first to be as- 
sociated with axon growth. The most 
prominent members of this group are 
the laminins, the collagens, and fibro- 
nectin. As their family name indicates, 
all three of these adhesion molecules are 
found in the extracellular matrix (ECM), 
the macromolecular complex outside the cell. The ECM's 
components can be secreted by the cell itself or by its neigh- 
bors; however, rather than diffusing away from the cell af- 
ter secretion, these molecules form polymers and create a 
durable local extracellular substance. A broad class of cell 
surface receptors known as integrins binds specifically to 
these ECM molecules (Figure 23.4A). Integrins do not have 
kinase activity or any other direct signaling capacity. In- 
stead, the binding of laminin, collagen, or fibronectin to 
integrins triggers a cascade of events—perhaps via interac- 
tions between the cytoplasmic domains of integrins with 
kinases and other signaling molecules, as well as Ca?* chan- 
nels—that can stimulate axon growth and elongation. 
The role of extracellular matrix molecules in axon guid- 
ance is particularly clear in the embryonic peripheral nervous 
system. Axons extending through peripheral tissues grow 
through loosely arrayed mesenchymal cells that fill the in- 
terstices of the embryo (between sheets of epithelia), and the 
spaces between these mesenchymal cells are rich in extracel- 
lular matrix molecules. Peripheral axons also grow along the 
ar matrix molecules

interface of mesenchyme and epithelial tissues, including the 
boundaries between the neural tube and mesenchyme and 
between the mesenchyme and the epidermis, where orga- 
nized sheets of extracellular matrix components called basal 
lamina provide a supportive substrate. In tissue culture as 
well as in the periphery of the embryo, the different extracel- 
lular matrix molecules have different capacities to stimulate 
axon growth. The role of these molecules in the central ner- 
vous system is less clear. Some of the same molecules are 
present in the extracellular spaces of the CNS, but they are 
not organized into a basal lamina as in the periphery, and 
therefore have been more difficult to study. 
The CAMs and cadherins are found on growing axons 
and growth cones as well as on surrounding cells and targets 
(Figure 23.4B,C). Moreover, both CAMs and cadherins have 
dual functions as ligands and receptors, usually via homo- 
philic ("like with like") binding. Some of the CAMs, espe- 
cially the L1 CAM, have been associated with the bundling, 
or fasciculation, of groups of axons. Cadherins have been sug- 
gested as important determinants of final target selection in

coveries in human genetics and struc-

made it possible to identify mutations 
in genes that regulate axon guidance 
during development, and to visualize 
_ the consequences for axon pathways 
in the mature human brain. There is 
now a "short list" of rare but highly 
informative mutations in genes known 
to regulate growth cone pathfinding 
or axon extension during development 
(see the table). These mutations disrupt 
both central nervous system axon tracts 
and peripheral nerves (including cra- 
nial nerves) that control facial expres- 
sion and eye movements. Their results 
include mild and specific motor or sen- 
sory deficits as well as more global dif- 
ficulties, including intellectual disability 
and social and cognitive impairments. 
Four of these are particularly notewor- 
thy based on their established functions 
in axon guidance and growth. 
¢ The gene for the Ig-superfamily 
cell adhesion molecule L1, which is 
found on the X chromosome, is asso-

that includes intellectual and lan- 
guage disabilities and severely dimin- 
ished motor control.

¢ Mutations in ROBO3, a receptor for 
the Slit family of secreted chemore-

or no ability to move their eyes hori- 
zontally, as well as postural and mo- 
tor control difficulties that get worse 
with age. 
KIF21A is a member of the large fam- 
ily of kinesin motor proteins that me- 
diate organelle and membrane traffic 
via interactions with the microtubule 
cytoskeleton. This particular kinesin 
is mutated in patients with congenital 
fibrosis of the extraocular muscles, which 
reflects diminished growth of the ocu- 
lomotor and abducens nerves. 
The Ig-superfamily secreted adhe- 
sion signaling molecule KAL1 is one 
of several mutant proteins involved 
in Kallmann's syndrome, which dis- 
rupts olfactory nerve development 
peripherally and olfactory tract de- 
velopment centrally. Patients with 
Kallmann's syndrome are anosmic 
(thus the KAL1 protein is also known 
as anosmin); they are also infertile 
due to the failure of gonadotropin- 
releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons 
to migrate from the olfactory placode 
to the hypothalamus. 
In all four of these conditions, the 
mutated genes encode either cell adhe- 
sion molecules or cytoskeletal regula- 
tors of axon growth.

The advent of diffusion tensor

presumed consequences of disrupted 
axon guidance. One of the most strik-

agenesis of the corpus callosum (Figures 
A and B), seen in a variety of devel- 
opmental disorders including L1 syn- 
drome. Similarly, DTI has demonstrated 
that most axon pathways, including 
ascending sensory and descending 
motor tracts, fail to cross in the medulla 
in patients with horizontal gaze palsy 
(Figures C and D). This anatomical fail- 
ure is accompanied by functional chang- 
es, including anomalous, completely 
ipsilateral activation of the motor cortex 
during independent hand movements 
(Figure E). 
The genetic and imaging observa- 
tions described here reinforce the long- 
held view that axon guidance—due 
to its molecular complexity and the 
critical requirement of this process 
to achieve appropriate brain connec- 
tions—is a likely target for diseases that 
alter brain function. The rare disorders 
associated with adhesion and growth 
molecules indicate that specific central 
and peripheral axon pathways can be 
altered during development, with cor- 
responding behavioral alterations seen 
throughout the lifetime of the patient. 
It is also likely that disrupted axon

additional genetic analysis and the 
the transition from growing axon to synapse (see below). For 
both CAMs and cadherins, the unique ability of each class 
to function as both ligand and receptor (L1, for example, is 
its own receptor) may be important for recognition between 
specific sets of axons and targets. Both CAMs and cadherins 
rely on asomewhat indirect route of signal transduction. The 
Ca**-independent CAMs interact with cytoplasmic kinases 
to initiate cellular responses, whereas the Ca'*-dependent 
cadherins engage the APC/B-catenin pathway (also activated 
by Wnts; see Chapter 22). 
A final class of non-diffusible axon guidance molecules 
includes a large family of ephrin ligands (sometimes ab- 
breviated "efns") and their tyrosine kinase receptors (Eph 
receptors, or Ephs) that constitute a cell-cell recognition 
of axon guidance. Cold Spring Harb. Persp.

code in a variety of tissues (Figure 23.4D). In the develop- 
ing nervous system, immature axons use ephrins and Eph 
receptors to recognize appropriate pathways for growth as 
well as appropriate sites for synaptogenesis (see below). 
Although identified as ligands and receptors, the binding 
of ephrins with Ephs can initiate signaling via the eph- 
rins, which can interact with cytoplasmic protein kinases. 
Ephrins and Ephs activate a variety of signaling pathways 
and, depending on the nature of signal transduction, can 
be either growth-promoting or growth-limiting. To limit 
axon growth, the extracellular domain of an ephrin ligand 
can be proteolytically cleaved, or Eph receptors can be re- 
moved via selective endocytosis, thus terminating signaling. 
The dependence of axon growth and guidance on adhesive

by these interactions is underscored by the pathogenesis 
of several inherited human developmental or neurological 
disorders. These syndromes include X-linked hydrocepha- 
lus; MASA (an acronym for mental retardation, aphasia,

lead to the partial absence of the corpus callosum that con- 
nects the two cerebral hemispheres (referred to as callosal 
agenesis), or of the corticospinal tract, which carries cortical 
information to the spinal cord. These rare congenital anoma- 
lies are now understood to arise from errors in the signaling 
mechanisms normally responsible for axon navigation via 
cell surface adhesion molecules. 
Chemoattraction and 
Chemorepulsion 
A growing axon must eventually find an 
appropriate target while avoiding inap- 
propriate ones. With remarkable fore- 
sight, Cajal proposed that target-derived 
signals, most likely released by the tar- 
get cells themselves, selectively attract 
erowth cones to useful destinations. In 
addition to this chemoattraction predicted 
by Cajal, it was long supposed that there 
might also be chemorepellent signals that 
discourage axon growth toward inap- 
propriate regions (Figure 23.5A). Despite 
the importance of chemoattraction and

Signals provided by the embryonic environment. (A) Basic 
signal classes. Chemoattractant, or tropic, signals (pluses) can operate from a 
distance and reorient growth toward the source of the cue, often by acting ona 
pioneer growth cone that sets out a course distinct from the fasciculated followers. 
Similar cues acting on or near the surface of the axon shaft help maintain groups 
of axons as fascicles, which is essential for formation of coherent nerves and tracts. 
Chemorepulsive signals (minuses) can also act from a distance, or they act at regions 
where axons must defasciculate from a nascent nerve in order to change their 
trajectory or avoid an inappropriate target. Trophic signals (gold) support growth 
and differentiation of the axon and its parent nerve cell. (B) The netrin/slit family of 
attractive and repulsive secreted signals acts through two distinct receptors, DCC 
("deleted in colorectal cancer"), which binds netrin, and robo, the receptor for slit. (C) 
Semaphorins are primarily repulsive cues that can either be bound to the cell surface 
or secreted. Their receptors (the plexins and neuropilin) are found on growth cones. 
(D) Growth cone-collapsing activity of semaphorin (upper panels) depends on Ca** 
signaling, which is initiated by semaphorin signaling (lower panels). (A after Huber 
et al., 2003; D from Gomez and Zheng, 2006 and Letourneau, 2002.)

CHAPTER 23 
chemorepulsion in constructing pathways and circuits, the 
identity of the signals themselves remained uncertain until 
the early 1990s. One problem was the vanishingly small 
amounts of such factors expressed in the developing em- 
bryo. Another was that of distinguishing tropic molecules 
(which guide growing axons toward a source) from trophic 
molecules (which support the survival and growth of neu- 
rons and their processes once an appropriate target has 
been contacted). These problems were solved by laborious 
biochemical purification and analysis of attractive or repul- 
sive activities from vertebrate (chick) embryos and genetic 
analysis of axon growth in both Drosophila and C. elegans. 
Remarkably, the identity and function of chemoattractants 
and chemorepellents across phyla is highly conserved. 
One of the first families of chemoattractant molecules to 
be identified was the netrins (Sanskrit, "to guide"; Figure 
23.5B) In chick embryos, netrins were identified as proteins 
with chemoattractant activity following biochemical puri- 
fication. In C. elegans, an activity analogous to that of the 
netrins was first recognized as the product of a gene that 
influenced axon growth and guidance. The first such ver- 
tebrate gene to be isolated was named Unc for "uncoordi- 
nated," which describes the behavioral phenotype of the 
mutant worms; the cause is misrouted axons, misplaced or 
absent synapses, and disrupted circuits due to the absence 
of netrin activity. The netrins themselves have high homol- 
ogy to extracellular matrix molecules such as laminin, and 
in some cases may actually interact with the extracellular 
matrix to influence directed axon growth. Netrin chemoat- 
tractant signals are transduced by specific receptors includ- 
ing the molecule DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer). A dif- 
ferent receptor, Uncd (yet another C. elegans protein whose 
name is also used for its vertebrate orthologs), mediates 
netrin-dependent chemorepulsion. Like many cell surface 
adhesion molecules, netrin receptors have repeated amino 
acid motifs in their extracellular domains; a transmembrane 
domain; and an intracellular domain with no known enzy- 
matic activity. Thus, in order for netrin binding to stimulate 
changes in the target cell, other proteins with catalytic ac- 
tivity must interact with the cytoplasmic domain. The Rho/ 
GAP family of signaling proteins, all of which modulate 
second messenger-mediated cytoskeletal modification, are 
thought to provide a final step in netrin signaling. 
The initial characterization of netrin in vertebrates was 
guided by the observation that there seemed to be a che- 
moattractive signal in the spinal cord ventral midline that 
influenced the directed growth of spinothalamic axons 
(Figure 23.6A,B). Netrins are localized to the floorplate of 
the neural tube (see Figure 22.2), which defines the ventral 
midline in the developing spinal cord as well as sites where 
axons must cross from one side of the cord to the other. 
Indeed, mutation of the netrin-1 gene (whose expression is 
dramatically enhanced in the floorplate and other midline 
brain regions where axons cross) disrupts the development 
of axon pathways that cross the midline, including those of 
the spinothalamic tract (Figure 23.6C) and the cerebral com- 
missures (the corpus callosum and anterior commissure). 
Even though netrin signaling can be downregulated by 
proteolytic cleavage of the DCC receptor, additional mech- 
anisms insure that once netrin directs axons across the mid- 
line, they do not cross back. The secreted factor slit and 
its receptor robo (named for the phenotypes of Drosophilia 
mutants in which these genes were first identified) are im- 
portant for preventing an axon from straying back over the 
midline once it has crossed initially in response to netrin 
(see Figures 23.5B and 23.6B). Slit and robo are available 
immediately off the midline and are thought to terminate 
the growth cone's sensitivity to netrin once it has crossed 
from one side of the CNS to the other. Thus, slit and robo 
(and probably several other molecules) and the signaling 
pathways they activate orchestrate the unidirectional cross- 
ing of axons at the midline. The successful completion of 
such crossing by axons is essential for the construction of 
all major sensory, motor, and associational pathways in the 
mammalian brain (see Box 23A). 
Beyond the specific challenge of crossing the midline— 
and then not crossing back—constructing the nervous sys- 
tem generally requires telling axons where not to grow. Two 
broad classes of chemorepellent molecules (in addition to 
slit and robo, which function primarily at the midline) have 
been described. The first class is associated with central ner- 
vous system myelin; molecules of this class are particularly 
important for regulating axon regrowth following injury in 
the mature nervous system (see Chapter 25). Molecules 
belonging to the second class of chemorepellents, the 
semaphorins (Greek, "signal bearer"), are active primarily 
during neural development (see Figure 23.5C). Semapho- 
rins are bound to cell surfaces or to the extracellular matrix, 
where they prevent the extension of nearby axons. Their 
receptors, like those for cell surface adhesion molecules, 
are transmembrane proteins (including the plexins and 
a protein called neuropilin) whose cytoplasmic domains 
have no known catalytic activity. Nevertheless, semaphorin 
signaling leads to changes in Ca** concentration that pre- 
sumably activate intercellular kinases and other signaling 
molecules to modify the growth cone cytoskeleton. Studies 
using cultured vertebrate neurons indicate that semapho- 
rins cause growth cones to collapse and axon extension to 
cease (see Figure 23.5D). Much of the initial characteriza- 
tion of semaphorin chemorepellent activity emerged from 
studies of invertebrates (particularly Drosophila) in which 
mutation or manipulation of these genes caused axons to 
grow abnormally. In developing vertebrates, however, the 
activity of semaphorins has been harder to demonstrate. 
Mutations in semaphorins, plexins, or neuropilin in mam- 
mals do not yield dramatic phenotypes. Although none of 
these signals alone explains initial choices and resulting tra- 
jectories of developing axons, it is nonetheless clear that the

semaphorins make an important contribution to the orderly 
construction of axon pathways in both the peripheral and 
central nervous systems of vertebrates. 
The Formation of Topographic Maps 
In the somatic sensory, visual, and motor systems, neuro- 
nal connections are arranged such that neighboring points 
in the periphery are represented by adjacent locations in 
the appropriate regions of the central nervous system (see 
Chapters 9, 11, and 16). In other systems (e.g., the auditory 
and olfactory systems), there are also orderly representa- 
tions of various stimulus attributes such as frequency or 
sensory receptor identity in at least some central regions 
(see Chapters 13 and 15). In the early 1960s, Roger Sperry 
(who later did pioneering work on the functional special- 
ization of the cerebral hemispheres; see Chapter 27) ar- 
ticulated the chemoaffinity hypothesis. This hypothesis,

based primarily on Sperry's work on the visual systems of 
frogs and goldfish, explains how topographic maps arise 
during development. In these animals, the terminals of reti- 
nal ganglion cells form a precise topographic map in the 
optic tectum (the tectum is homologous to the mammalian 
superior colliculus; Figure 23.7A). When Sperry crushed the 
optic nerve and allowed it to regenerate (fish and amphib- 
ians, unlike mammals, can regenerate CNS axon tracts; 
see Chapter 25), he found that retinal axons reestablished 
the same pattern of connections in the tectum. Even if the 
eye was rotated 180°, the regenerating axons grew back to 
their original tectal destinations (causing some behavioral 
confusion for the frog; Figure 23.7B). Accordingly, Sperry 
proposed that each tectal cell carries a chemical "identifi- 
cation tae" and that the growing terminals of retinal gan- 
glion cells have complementary tags such that the retinal 
cells seek out a specific location in the tectum. The "iden- 
tification tags" were assumed to be cell adhesion or cell

rupted, the axons regenerate with the appropriate specificity. (B) 
Even if the eye is rotated after severing the optic nerve, the axons 
regenerate to their original position in the tectum. This topo- 
graphic constancy is evident from the frog's behavior: When a fly is 
presented above, the frog consistently strikes downward, and vice 
versa. (C) In vitro assay for cell surface molecules that contribute 
to topographic specificity in the optic tectum. A set of alternating, 
90-uum wide stripes of membranes from anterior (A) and posterior 
(P) optic tectum of chicks were laid down ona 
glass coverslip. The 
posterior membranes have fluorescent particles added to make 
recognition molecules, and the "affinity" they engendered 
was presumed to be due to the selective binding of receptor 
molecules on the growth cones to corresponding molecules 
on the tectal cells at appropriate relative positions. 
Further experiments in the amphibian and avian visual 
systems made the strictest form of the chemoaffinity hy- 
pothesis—that is, the labeling of each tectal location by a 
distinctive recognition molecule—untenable. Rather than 
displaying a precise "lock-and-key" affinity, the behavior of

the boundaries of the stripes apparent (top of panels). Explants 
of retina from either nasal or temporal retina were placed on the 
stripes. Temporal axons prefer to grow on anterior membranes 
and are repulsed by posterior membranes. In contrast, nasal retinal 
axons grow equally well on both stripes. (D) Complementary gradi- 
ents of Eph receptors (in afferent cells and their growth cones) and 
ephrins (in the target cells) lead to differential affinities and topo- 
graphic mapping. In this model, retinal growth cones with a high 
concentration of Eph receptors (for a mouse retina, EohA5) would 
be more likely to recognize a lower concentration of ligand (for the 
mouse superior colliculus, ephrins A2 and A5), whereas a growth 
cone with low Eph receptor concentration would recognize a high- 
er concentration of ligand. (A,B after Sperry, 1963; C from Walter et 
al., 1987; D after Wilkinson, 2001.) 
growing axons suggested that there are gradients of cell sur- 
face molecules to which growing axons respond. Normally, 
axons from the temporal region of the retina innervate the 
anterior pole of the tectum and avoid the posterior pole. 
Temporal retinal axons, when presented with a choice of 
cell membranes derived from anterior or posterior tectal 
regions as a substrate, grow exclusively on anterior mem- 
branes, avoiding membranes derived from the "wrong" 
region of the tectum (Figure 23.7C). A likely candidate for 

the negative-guidance signal for temporal axons in the pos- 
terior tectum was purified and its gene cloned. The pro- 
tein—initially called RAGS (repulsive axon guidance signal) 
turned out to belong to the Eph family of cell surface-bound 
adhesion/signaling molecules (see Figure 23.4D). In the eye 
and the tectum, ephrins and Eph receptors are distributed 
in complementary gradients so that similar levels of ligand 
and receptor are matched, thus facilitating topographic 
mapping of the nasal and temporal retina along the an- 
terior—posterior axis of the tectum. Subsequent work has 
associated several ephrins and Ephs with topographic map- 
ping in a number of systems. These observations accord 
with the idea that chemoaffinity operates not by one-to- 
one or lock-and-key recognition, but by gradients of af- 
finities that provide axons and their targets with markers of 
general position within a system of coordinates (like north, 
south, east, and west on a map). Additional sharpening of 
topography may rely on activity-dependent mechanisms 
that continue to modify patterns of synaptic connections 
(see Chapter 24). 
Selective Synapse Formation 
Once an axon reaches its target region, additional cell-cell 
interactions dictate which target cells to innervate from 
among a variety of potential synaptic partners. There are 
some absolute restrictions to synaptic associations. For 
example, neurons do not make synapses on nearby glial 
or connective tissue cells, and many instances have been 
described in which nerve and target cell types that are not 
normally interconnected show little or no inclination to es- 
tablish synaptic partnerships with one another when con- 
fronted with the possibility by experimental manipulation, 
either in vivo or in vitro. When synaptogenesis does pro- 
ceed, however, neurons and their targets in both the central 
and peripheral nervous systems appear to associate accord- 
ing to a continuously variable system of preferences. Such 
biases guide the pattern of innervation that arises in devel- 
opment (or reinnervation during regeneration; see Chap- 
ter 25) without limiting it in an absolute way. The target 
cells residing in muscles, autonomic ganglia, or the brain 
are certainly not equivalent, but neither are they unique 
with respect to the innervation they can receive. This rela- 
tive promiscuity most likely reflects the fact that potential 
pre- and postsynaptic sites may share many molecules that 
identify them as potential locations for making a connec- 
tion. Thus, if there is a not a strong specific affinity, more 
generic recognition events occur, and anomalous connec- 
tions will be made. This can result in problems following 
neural injury, since regenerated patterns of innervation are 
not always appropriate (see Figure 23.7B and Chapter 25). 
Much of this imprecision may reflect the overlapping 
subset of molecules that regulate synapse formation as 
well as axonal and dendritic growth. Several observations 
CONSTRUCTION OF NEURAL CIRCUITS 
521 
show that many of the same adhesion molecules that par- 
ticipate in axon guidance contribute to the identification 
and stabilization of a synaptic site on target cells, as well as 
to the ability of a growing axon to recognize specific sites 
as optimal. Thus, in the first stages of synapse formation 
(Figure 28.8A), the ephrins, the Ca?*-independent CAMs, 
and the cadherin families of Ca'*-dependent adhesion mol- 
ecules are all thought to influence recognition of suitable 
postsynaptic positions on dendrites, cell bodies, or other 
appropriate targets (i.e., muscle fibers) by a nascent pre- 
synaptic process (derived by the conversion of a growth 
cone to an immature presynaptic terminal). In the next step, 
pre- and postsynaptic specializations must be elaborated 
for appropriate cellular specializations for synaptic commu- 
nication (Figure 23.8B,C). Several soluble or secreted sig- 
nals have been implicated in this process, including growth 
factors and neurotransmitters themselves. Subsequently, 
specialized adhesion molecules link pre- and postsynaptic 
domains so that the synapse emerges as a discrete, rela- 
tively stable intracellular specialization for local electrical 
or chemical signaling. 
Among this list of molecules that initiate synaptogenesis, 
* 
neuregulin1 (Nrg1) has emerged as an essential regula- 
tor of expression and localization of postsynaptic receptors 
and other proteins. Nrg1 is transmembrane protein usually 
made in presynaptic cells and released following proteo- 
lytic cleavage of the ectodomain (outside portion) of the 
protein. This cleaved, "mature" form of Nrg1 then diffuses 
and binds to specific receptors: the ErB family of epider- 
mal growth factor-like receptors, found on the surfaces 
of many developing central neurons as well as on muscle 
cells and other targets of peripheral neurons. Nrg1 signal- 
ing is thought to elicit increased synthesis and insertion of 
neurotransmitter receptors at a nascent postsynaptic site. 
Intriguingly, the human NRG7 gene is a site of multiple 
polymorphic changes (altered DNA sequences that dif- 
fer from those of most individuals sequenced) associated 
with schizophrenia and other behavioral disorders thought 
to alter development or maintenance of synaptic con- 
nections. Individuals with these altered DNA sequences 
have a slightly (but significantly) increased probability of 
schizophrenia compared to individuals without the poly- 
morphisms. The DNA sequence changes, however, do not 
result in altered amino acid sequences for Nrg1 protein (i.e., 
they occur in noncoding regions of the NRG1 gene), and it 
remains uncertain how they might alter the gene's expres- 
sion or the protein's activity. 
Two families of adhesion molecules are particularly cen- 
tral to the construction of synapses: neurexins, found in 
the presynaptic membrane; and their binding partners the 
neuroligins, found in the postsynaptic membrane. In ad- 
dition to the ability of neurexins and neuroligins to bind 
one another and promote adhesion between the pre- and 
postsynaptic membranes, neurexins have a specialized

Molecular mechanisms involved in synapse 
formation. (A) Initiation of a synapse depends centrally upon 
local recognition between the presumptive pre- and postsyn- 
aptic membranes mediated by members of the cadherin and 
protocadherin family of Ca?* cell adhesion molecules (cadherins 
and protocadherins). This local recognition is accompanied by 
the initial accumulation of synaptic vesicles as well as transport 
vesicles that contain molecular components that contribute to 
the presynaptic active zone. (B) Once the initial specialization is 
established, additional adhesion molecules are recruited, includ- 
ing Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecule (SynCAM), a member of the 
Ca?*-independent, homophilic binding adhesion molecule family 
(like NCAM; see Figure 23.4B), neurexin and neuroligin (see panel 
C), and the ephrinB ligands and their EphB receptors. Adhesive 
signaling between these molecules initiates differentiation of 
the presynaptic active zone and the postsynaptic density. The 
presynaptic terminal also releases molecules (e.g., neuregulin) 
that influence the expression and clustering of postsynaptic 
receptors and associated proteins. (C) The interaction of neurexin 
(a presynaptic transmembrane adhesion protein) with neuroligin 
(a postsynaptic adhesion protein) is central for recruiting and 
retaining cytoskeletal elements that localize synaptic vesicles to 
the presynaptic terminal and mediate their fusion. In addition, 
neurexin is important for localizing voltage-gated Ca** channels 
to insure local vesicle release. Neuroligin, upon binding neurexin, 
is essential for localizing neurotransmitter receptors and post- 
synaptic proteins to the postsynaptic specialization. Neuregulin 
is released via local proteolytic cleavage and binds to dimeric 
ErbB receptor kinases or to dimeric ErbB/epidermal growth factor 
(EGF) receptor kinases. (A,B after Waites et al, 2005; C after Dean 
and Dreshbach, 2006.) 
transmembrane domain that helps localize synaptic vesi- 
cles, docking proteins, and fusion molecules contributed by 
active zone vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Neuroligins 
have similar functions for the postsynaptic site, where they 
interact with specialized postsynaptic proteins to promote 
the clustering of receptors and channels of the postsynaptic 
density as the synapse matures (see Figure 23.8C). Neurex- 
ins and neuroligins are shared by all developing synapses, 
perhaps explaining why some cells, when confronted by 
targets different from those they normally innervate, can 
make connections with the available, if unusual, target. The 
association of polymorphisms in neurexin and neuroligin 
genes with increased risk for behavioral disorders such as 
autism and schizophrenia has reinforced the hypothesis 
that these molecules are key for establishing appropriate 
connectivity. There is some indication that different neu- 
roligins are deployed at postsynaptic specializations in 
glutamatergic, excitatory synapses versus GABAergic, in- 
hibitory synapses. Nevertheless, there must be additional 
mechanisms that sort out specific individual synapses from 
one another to achieve the ultimate precision required to 
establish functional neural circuits. 
eS

The mechanisms by which neighboring synapses are 
sorted out remain unclear; however, some common themes 
and compelling candidate molecules have emerged. First, 
the diversity of ephrin ligands and Eph receptors, along 
with their established roles in topographic map formation, 
indicates that these molecules likely contribute to synapse 
specificity. Second, genes encoding additional candidates— 
all of which are cell adhesion molecules—have multiple 
sites for alternative splicing of transcripts, and thus can en- 
code a large number of variants of the same basic protein. 
Third, some of these variants tend to be distributed in dif- 
ferent pre- and postsynaptic sites, sometimes in a single 
neuron. Finally, when these genes are mutated, patterns of 
connectivity are disrupted in subtle but informative ways. 
In the fly, the gene for the cell adhesion molecule 
DSCAM1 (named for its similarity to the mammalian 
down syndrome cell adhesion molecule, the gene for which 
is located on chromosome 21, the chromosome duplicated 
in Down syndrome) has approximately 38,000 isoforms 
based on the numbers of exons in the gene and predicted 
splicing (Figure 23.9A). Like the other Ca*-independent 
cell adhesion molecules to which it is related (such as 
NCAM; see Figure 23.4B), DSCAM1 variants are selective 
for homophilic versus heterophilic binding. Surprisingly, 
homophilic binding leads to repulsion, suggesting that an 
essential sorting rule prevents a neuron from making syn- 
apses with itself, or at closely adjacent postsynaptic sites. 
When DSCAM 1 and its close relative DSCAM2 (which 
has only two splice variants) are mutated in Drosophila, ap- 
propriate synapse sorting fails in the insect's eye, so that 
dendrites of like rather than different cells cluster together 
(Figure 23.9B). Thus, synapses may be sorted based upon 
local variations of DSCAM-mediated repulsive recogni- 
tion. Mammalian DSCAM genes do not have similar splice 
isoform diversity; however, they apparently influence self- 
recognition. When mammalian DSCAM genes are mu- 
tated, the distribution of subsets of neurons and process 
that connect with one another is disrupted, and like cells 
cluster anomalously with like cells. 
The protocadherins are the last family of candidate 
genes thought to underlie synapse specificity. At the mo- 
lecular level, protocadherins resemble the general cadherin 
family of cell adhesion molecules (see Figure 23.4C). The 
single gene encoding a large number of protocadherins is 
remarkably similar to DSCAM in the fly. Thus, there are 
three regions (a, 8, and y) consisting of multiple alterna- 
tively spliced exons that encode the extracellular and trans- 
membrane domains of individual protocadherin variants 
(there are 58) and a conserved domain that encodes the 
intracellular portion of all protocadherin isoforms (Figure 
23.9C). Protocadherin isoforms on opposing cells bind to 
each other with varying affinity based upon their degree 
of similarity (high binding) or divergence (lower binding). 
Moreover, protocadherins are not uniformly expressed 
CONSTRUCTION OF NEURAL CIRCUITS

at neighboring synaptic sites in cultured neurons (Figure 
23.9D) or in a number of regions of the central nervous sys- 
tem. Thus, isoforms of protocadherins may invest synaptic 
sites in the mammalian nervous system with distinct identi- 
ties. Analysis of mutant mice in which protocadherin gene 
function is eliminated indicates that these genes are crucial 
for synapse formation generally; however, their specific role 
in sorting of synapses remains uncertain. Although several 
families of molecules might contribute to the development 
of synapse diversity, it is still not clear whether molecular 
differences alone can explain the final synaptic pattern that 
emerges in a given neural circuit (see Chapter 24). 
Regulation of Neuronal Connections 
by Trophic Interactions 
Once synaptic contacts are established and the initial dis- 
tribution of synapses is set, neurons become dependent 
on the presence of their targets for continued survival as 
well as the further growth and differentiation of axons and 
dendrites. In the absence of synaptic partners, the axons 
and dendrites of developing neurons typically atrophy and 
often die. This long-term dependency between neurons 
and their targets is referred to as trophic interaction (from 
the Greek trophé, meaning, roughly, "nourishment"). The 
nourishment provided by trophic interactions is not the sort 
derived from metabolites such as glucose or ATP. Instead, 
the dependence is based on signaling molecules provided 
by target cells, generally referred to as neurotrophic fac- 
tors (also called neurotrophins). Neurotrophic factors, like 
some other intercellular signaling molecules (for example, 
mitogens that promote cell proliferation and cytokines that 
regulate inflammation and immune responses), are secreted 
in small quantities from cells in target tissues. These factors 
regulate differentiation, growth, and ultimately survival in 
nearby cells. 
Neurotrophic factors are unique in that, unlike 
inductive signaling molecules and cell adhesion molecules, 
their expression is limited to neurons and a few non-neural 
neuronal targets such as muscles. These factors are first de- 
tected after the initial populations of postmitotic neurons 
have been generated in the nascent central and peripheral 
nervous systems, and they help regulate the phase of neural 
development that begins once neurogenesis has concluded. 
Why do developing neurons depend so strongly on their 
targets, and what specific cellular and molecular interactions 
mediate this dependence? The answer to the first question 
lies in the changing scale of the developing nervous system 
and the body it serves, and the related need to precisely 
match the number of neurons in particular populations with 
the size and functional demands of their targets. A general— 
and surprising—strategy in vertebrate development is the 
production of an initial surplus of nerve cells (on the order 
of two- or threefold); the final population is subsequently 
established by the death of those neurons that fail to interact

supernumerary neurons, particularly the initiation of apop- 
tosis—the highly regulated processes that result in cell 
death—is mediated by a specific group of neurotrophic fac- 
tors, the neurotrophins (see below and Chapter 25). 
A series of studies dating from the start of the twentieth 
century showed that targets play a major role in determining 
the size of the neuronal populations that innervate them, 
presumably based upon the targets' provision of neuro- 
trophic factors. The pioneering neuroembryologists Viktor 
Hamburger and Rita Levi-Montalcini made these seminal 
observations, first independently and then collaboratively, in 
the 1930s and 1940s. A critical finding was that the removal 
of a limb bud from a chick embryo results, at later embryonic 
stages, in a striking reduction in the number of nerve cells 
(in this case a motor neurons) in corresponding portions 
of the spinal cord (Figure 23.10A,B). Apparently, signals in 
the limb bud (the target cells) ensure the survival of & mo- 
tor neurons. Furthermore, in normal embryos, an appar- 
ent surplus of motor neurons disappears by the end of early 
development. The surplus neurons are generated prior to 
the growth and innervation of the limb. They innervate the 
immature limb, but then die—presumably due to a lack of 
trophic support—as the motor neuron population becomes 
matched to the needs of the developing limb musculature. 
Based on these observations, it seemed possible that 
when a limb bud is present, innervating neurons in the 
spinal cord compete with one another for a resource avail- 
able in limited supply in the developing limb. In support 
of this idea, many neurons that would normally die can 
be rescued by augmenting the amount of target tissue 
available, thereby providing extra trophic support—in this 
example, by experimentally adding to the embryo a limb 
bud that can be innervated by the same spinal segments 
that innervate the normal limb (Figure 23.10C,D). Careful 
monitoring of cell proliferation versus cell death shows that 
the extra cells are not generated de novo (i.e., they do not 
arise from precursors in response to a mitogenic signal from 
the extra target). Instead, they are "rescued" from a neuron 
population that is overproduced in early development and

Target-derived trophic support regulates

ates an excess of neurons (green) prior to the differentiation and 
innervation of the limb. Normally, some of these neurons are lost 
once the appropriate level of innervation is established in the 
developing limb bud. Limb bud amputation in a chick embryo 
at the appropriate stage of incubation (about 2.5 days) further 
depletes the pool of motor neurons that would have innervated 
the missing extremity. (B) Cross section of the lumbar spinal cord

The motor neurons (red dots) in the ventral horn that would have

A normal complement of motor neurons is present on the other 
side; most of the normally supernumerary neurons have been 
lost. (C) Adding an extra limb bud before the normal period of 
cell death rescues early-generated neurons that normally would 
have died. (D) Such augmentation leads to an abnormally large 
number of limb motor neurons on the side related to the extra 
limb, and these neurons are recruited from the pool of cells over- 
produced at an earlier stage of development (green dots) rather 
than generated de novo through cell proliferation elicited by the 
added target. (After Hamburger, 1958, 1977 and Hollyday and 
Hamburger, 1958.) 
normally winnowed based on the limited trophic support 
from the targets. Thus, the size of nerve cell populations in 
the adult is not fully determined by a rigid genetic program 
of cell proliferation followed by highly specified innervation 
of the target. The connections between nerve cells and their 
targets can be modified by neuron-target interactions in 
each developing individual. 
Competitive Interactions and the 
Formation of Neuronal Connections 
Once the size of a neuronal population is established by tro- 
phic regulation, trophic interactions continue to modulate 
the formation of synaptic connections, beginning in embry- 
onic life and extending far beyond birth. Certain problems 
must be solved during the establishment of innervation. 
These include insuring that the "right" number of remaining 
axons innervates each target cell ("right" suggests sufficient 

526 
CHAPTER 23 
FIGURE 23.11 
Synapse number and pattern in the mam- 
malian peripheral nervous system are adjusted during 
early postnatal life. In muscles (A) and in peripheral ganglia 
whose neurons have no dendrites (B), each axon innervates 
a larger number of target cells at birth than in maturity. Most 
of this rudimentary multiple innervation is eliminated shortly 
after birth. In both muscles and ganglia, however, the size and 
complexity of the terminal arbor that remains on each mature 
target cell increases. Thus, each axon elaborates more and more 
terminal branches and synaptic endings on the target cells it will 
innervate in maturity. The common denominator of this pro- 
cess is not a net loss of synapses, but the removal of immature 
contacts from all but one or a few axons on each target, and the 
focus on fewer target cells by a progressively increasing amount 
of synaptic machinery for each axon that remains. (After Purves 
and Lichtman, 1980.) 
innervation to allow the target cell to generate electrical 
signals and integrate or process information vital to the 
operation of its neural circuit) and insuring that each axon 
innervates the "right" number of target cells. Getting these 
numbers correct is another major achievement of trophic in- 
teractions between developing neurons and target cells, and 
it is necessary for establishing appropriate circuits to support 
specific functional demands of each individual organism. 
Studying synaptic refinement in the complex circuitry of 
the cerebral cortex or other regions of the central nervous 
system is a formidable challenge. Many fundamental ideas 
about the ongoing modification of developing brain circuitry 
have come from simpler, more accessible parts of the nervous 
system, most notably the vertebrate neuromuscular junction 
and autonomic ganglion cells (Figure 23.11). Adult skeletal 
muscle fibers and neurons in some classes of autonomic 
ganglia (parasympathetic neurons) are each innervated by 
a single axon. Initially, however, each of these target cells 
is innervated by axons from several neurons, a condition 
called polyneuronal innervation. In such cases, inputs are 
gradually lost during early postnatal development until only 
one remains. This process of loss is generally referred to as 
synapse elimination, although here "elimination" refers to 
a reduction in the number of different axonal inputs to the 
target cells, not to a reduction in the overall number of syn- 
aptic contacts (the individual specialized junctions between 
pre- and postsynaptic cells) made on postsynaptic cells. 
In fact, the overall number of synaptic contacts in the pe- 
ripheral nervous system increases steadily during the course 
of development, as is also the case throughout the brain 
(see Chapter 24). The elimination of some initial inputs (i.e., 
an individual axon making one or a few synaptic contacts) 
to muscle and ganglion cells is a process in which synapses 
originating from different neurons compete with one an- 
other for "ownership" of an individual target cell. Patterns 
of electrical activity in the pre- and postsynaptic partners 
are thought to influence this competition for target space

fibers 
and neurotrophic support. For example, if acetylcholine re- 
ceptors at the neuromuscular junction are blocked by the 
potent AChR antagonist curare, polyneuronal innervation 
persists. Blocking presynaptic action potentials in the motor 
neuron axons (by silencing the nerve with TTX, a sodium 
channel blocker; see Box 6A) also prevents the reduction of 
polyneuronal innervation. Blocking neural activity therefore 
reduces or delays competitive interactions, presumably me- 
diated by neurotrophic signaling, and the associated syn- 
aptic rearrangements. 
Many useful insights into the nature of synaptic rear- 
rangement during development have come from direct 
observations of this process. Using different colored fluo- 
rescent dyes that stain either the presynaptic terminal or the 
postsynaptic receptors, Jeff Lichtman and his colleagues fol- 
lowed the same neuromuscular junction over days, weeks, 
and even longer (Figure 23.12A), with some unexpected 
results. Competition between synapses arising from differ- 
ent motor neurons does not involve the active displacement 
of the "losing" input by the eventual "winner." Instead, it 
appears that the inputs of the two competitors initially oc- 
cupy the same subregion of a nascent postsynaptic special- 
ization, but gradually segregate. The "losing" axon even- 
tually atrophies and retracts from the synaptic site; this is 
accomplished by a loss of the corresponding postsynaptic 
specializations associated with the "loser." Neurotransmit- 
ter receptors beneath the terminal branches that eventually 
will be eliminated are also lost. This receptor loss occurs 
before the nerve terminal has withdrawn and presumably 
reduces the synaptic strength of the input, which results 
in further loss of postsynaptic receptors, leading to further 
reduction in the strength of the input. This downward spiral

The elimination of multiple innervation in 
the PNS (neuromuscular junction) and CNS (cerebellum). 
(A) In this series of images, the same neuromuscular junction ina 
neonatal mouse has been imaged repeatedly, beginning on post- 
natal day 11 (P11). Initially, two axons (green and blue) innervate 
the muscle fiber (the local clustering of postsynaptic ACh recep- 
tors is shown in red). The arrow indicates the boundary between 
the postsynaptic territory of the green and blue axons. By P12, 
the proportion of territory occupied by the green and blue axons 
has begun to shift, with the blue axon terminal apparently los- 
ing postsynaptic space while the green axon terminal expands. 
This process continues at P13, and by P14 the blue axon has fully 
retreated, its synaptic terminal transformed into a large retraction 
bulb (arrow at P14). Within an additional day, the retracting axon is 
almost fully withdrawn from the synaptic site. (B) Single climbing 
fiber axons (red) in the developing cerebellum initially innervate 
multiple Purkinje cells (asterisks) during early postnatal develop- 
ment (postnatal day 7, P7). Over the course of approximately 2 
weeks, individual climbing fibers retract immature axon branches 
from all but one Purkinje cell. The climbing fiber then elaborates 
an extensive axon that innervates most of the dendritic arbor of 
one (and only one) Purkinje cell. (A from Walsh and Lichtman, 
2003; B from Hashimoto et al., 2009.) 
of synaptic efficacy presumably results in withdrawal of the 
presynaptic terminal. The remaining terminals continue to 
enlarge and strengthen as the end plate region expands 
during postnatal muscle growth. 
Elimination of inputs and redistribution of synaptic con- 
tacts is evident in a variety of other peripheral and cen- 
tral nervous system regions. In autonomic ganglia in the 
peripheral nervous system, the numbers of presynaptic ax- 
ons innervating target neurons also decrease as the number 
of synaptic contacts from the remaining axons increases. A 
similar process has been described in the central nervous 
system. In the cerebellum, each adult Purkinje cell is inner- 
vated by a single climbing fiber (see Chapter 18); however, 
during early development, each Purkinje cell receives mul- 
tiple climbing fiber inputs. During postnatal life, each fiber 
retracts branches from neighboring cells and elaborates 
multiple branches and synaptic contacts on the apical den- 
drite of a single Purkinje cell target (Figure 23.12B). Finally, 
in the visual cortex, initial binocular innervation of cells is 
eliminated to establish segregated, molecularly driven in- 
puts (see Chapter 24). 
Thus, the pattern of synaptic connections that emerges 
in the adult is not simply a consequence of the biochemical 
identities of synaptic partners or other rigid developmental 
rules. Rather, the mature wiring plan is the result of a much 
more flexible process in which local neuronal connections 
are formed, removed, and remodeled according to local cir- 
cumstances that reflect molecular constraints, the detailed 
structure and size of the target, and ongoing electrical ac- 
tivity. These interactions guarantee that every target cell is 
innervated—and continues to be innervated—by the right 
number of inputs and synapses, and that every innervating 
axon contacts the right number of target cells with an ap- 
propriate number of synaptic endings. This regulation of 
convergence (the number of inputs to a target cell) and di- 
vergence (the number of connections made bya neuron) in

CHAPTER 23 
BOX 23C Why Do Neurons Have Dendrites? 
Perhaps the most striking feature of 
neurons is their diverse morphol- 
ogy. Some classes of neurons have no 
_ dendrites at all; others have a modest 
| dendritic arborization; still others have 
an arborization that rivals the complex 
branching of a fully mature tree (see 
_ Figures 1.2 and 1.6). Why should this 
- be? Although there are many reasons 
_ for this diversity, neuronal geometry 
_ influences the number of different 
_ inputs that a target neuron receives by 
_ modulating competitive interactions 
~ among the innervating axons. 
Evidence that the number of inputs 
a neuron receives depends on its 
geometry has come from studies of the 
peripheral autonomic system, where it 
is possible to stimulate the full comple- 
ment of axons innervating an autonom- 
ic ganglion and its constituent neurons. 
This approach is not usually feasible 
in the central nervous system because 
of the anatomical complexity of most 
central circuits. Since individual post- 
synaptic neurons can also be labeled 
via an intracellular recording electrode, 
electrophysiological measurements of 
the number of different axons innervat- 
ing a neuron can routinely be correlated 
with target cell shape. In both para- 
sympathetic and sympathetic ganglia, 
the degree of preganglionic conver- 
gence onto a neuron is proportional 
to its dendritic complexity. Thus, 
neurons that lack dendrites alto- 
gether are generally innervated by a 
single input, whereas neurons with 
increasingly complex dendritic arbo- 
rizations are innervated by a propor- 
tionally greater number of different 
axons (see figure). This correlation of 
neuronal geometry and input num- 
ber holds within a single ganglion, 
among different ganglia in a single 
species, and among homologous 
ganglia across a range of species. 
(B) This graph summarizes observations 
of the number of innervating axons on 
a large number of rabbit ciliary gan- 
glion cells. There is a strong correlation 
between dendritic geometry and input 
number. (After Purves and Hume, 1981.)

Since ganglion cells that have few or _ 
no dendrites are initially innervated by 
several different inputs (see text), con- 
fining inputs to the limited arena of the 
developing cell soma evidently enhanc- 
es competition between them, whereas 
the addition of dendrites to a neuron 
allows multiple inputs to persist in 
peaceful coexistence. Importantly, the 
dendritic complexity of at least some 
classes of autonomic ganglion cells is 
influenced by neurotrophins.

Number of innervating axons 
A neuron innervated by a single 
axon will clearly be more limited in 
the scope of its responses than a neu- 
ron innervated by 100,000 inputs (1 to 
100,000 is the approximate range of 
convergence in the mammalian brain). 
By regulating the number of inputs that 
neurons receive, dendritic form greatly 
influences function.

the developing nervous system is another key consequence 
of trophic interactions among neurons and their targets. 
The regulation of convergence and divergence by neuro- 
trophic interactions is also influenced by the shape and size 
of neurons, particularly the dendrites (Box 23C). 
The Molecular Basis of Trophic 
Interactions 
Trophic interactions regulate three essential steps in the for- 
mation of mature neural circuits. These three functions—sur- 
vival of a subset of neurons from a considerably larger popu- 
lation, formation and maintenance of appropriate numbers 
of connections, and the elaboration of axonal and dendritic 
branches to support these connections—can be rationalized 
at least in part by the supply and availability of molecular 
trophic factors. This perspective yields at least three general 
assumptions about neurons and their targets (which may be 
other neurons, or muscles and other peripheral structures). 
¢ Neurons depend on the availability of some minimum 
amount of trophic factor for the survival and subse- 
quent persistence of appropriate numbers of target 
connections. 
e Target tissues synthesize appropriate trophic factors 
and make them available to developing neurons. 
e Because targets produce trophic factors in limited 
amounts, the survival, persistence, and differentiation 
of developing neurons are subject to interneuronal 
competition for the available factor. 
Extensive studies of the neurotrophic protein nerve growth 
factor (NGF) provide support for these three assumptions. 
Although NGF was only the first-discovered of an entire 
family of trophic factors, its activity and regulation provide 
a model for understanding how neurotrophins provided by 
targets influence the survival and connections of the nerve 
cells that innervate them. 
NGF was discovered by Levi-Montalcini as an "activity" 
that elicited robust growth of neuronal processes both in the 
animal and in cell culture. The idea that a specific molecule 
might elicit neuronal growth originated with experiments in

which tumor cells secreting a substance that would be later 
identified as the NGF protein were implanted into a host ani- 
mal. These tumor cells survived, and they caused abnormal 
axon growth toward the implanted tumor cells. Subsequent 
experiments on cultured neurons grown in the presence or 
absence of what was later demonstrated to be NGF (Figure 
23.13A-C) showed that this "activity" could support neurite 
growth and enhance the survival of nerve cells in culture. 
NGF was eventually identified as a protein and was puri- 
fied from a rich biological source, the salivary glands of the 
male mouse (the reasons for the enrichment of NGF in male 
mouse salivary glands remain obscure). Subsequently, the 
gene for NGF was identified and cloned, and the amino acid 
sequence and three-dimensional structure of the NGF pro- 
tein were determined. 
Support for the idea that NGF is important for neuronal 
survival in more physiological circumstances emerged from 
a number of additional observations. Depriving developing 
mice of NGF (by the chronic administration of an NGF anti- 
serum or other strategies) resulted in adult mice that lacked

CHAPTER 23 
BOX 23D The Discovery of BDNF and the Neurotrophin Family 
_ During the 30 years or so of research 
that showed nerve growth factor to be 
a molecule fulfilling all the criteria for 
_ a target-derived neurotrophic factor, 
it also became clear that NGF affected 
only a few specific populations of 
_ peripheral neurons. It was therefore 
presumed that other neurotrophic fac- 
- tors must exist to support the survival 
and growth of other classes of neurons. 
In particular, whereas NGF was shown 
to be secreted by the peripheral targets 
_ of primary sensory and sympathetic 
neurons, other factors were presumably 
produced by target neurons in the brain 
and spinal cord that supported the cen- 
tral projections of sensory neurons. 
The serendipity of the mouse sali- 
vary gland and its extraordinary levels 
of NGF was not repeated for these 
additional factors, however, and the 
hunt for the neurotrophic factors pre- 
sumed to act in the central nervous 
system proved to be a long and ardu- 
ous one. Indeed, it was not until the 
1980s that the pioneering work of Yves 
Barde, Hans Thoenen, and their col- 
leagues succeeded in identifying and 
purifying a factor from the brain that 
they named brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF). As with NGF, this factor 
was purified on the basis of its ability to 
promote the survival and neurite out- 
growth of sensory neurons. However, 
BDNF is expressed at such vanishingly 
small levels that over a million-fold 
purification was necessary before the 
protein could be identified! 
Thereafter, microsequencing and 
recombinant DNA technology allowed 
rapid progress even from the scant 
amount of purified BDNF protein that 
was available. By 1989, Barde's group 
had succeeded in cloning the cDNA for 
BDNF. Surprisingly—despite its entirely 
different origin and distinct neuronal 
specificity BDNF turned out to be 
a close relative of NGF. Based on the 
homologies between the primary struc- 
tures of NGF and BDNF, the follow- 
ing year six independent laboratories 
(including Barde's) reported the cloning 
of a third member of the neurotrophin 
family, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). At 
Neurotrophins influence dendritic arbors in the developing cerebral cortex. The cell on 
the left was transfected with the GFP gene alone, while the one on the right was trans- 
fected with GFP plus the gene encoding BDNF. Within a day, the BDNF-transfected neu- 
rons grew elaborate dendritic branches reminiscent of the NGF-induced halo in periph- 
eral ganglia (see Figure 23.12B). (From Horch et al., 1999.) 
present, four members of the neuro- 
trophin family have been reported in a 
variety of vertebrate species (see text). 
Experiments on BDNF and other 
members of the neurotrophin family 
over the last decade support the conclu- 
sion that, in both the periphery and the 
CNS, survival and growth of different 
neuronal populations depend on differ- 
ent neurotrophins, and that these rela- 
tionships are mediated by expression of 
membrane receptors specific for each 
neurotrophin (see figure). However, 
the dramatic relationship between the 
survival of neuronal populations and 
neurotrophins has not been found in 
the CNS, which is where BDNF, NT-3, 
and NT-4/5, along with their receptors, 
are primarily expressed. The most strik- 
ing demonstration of this difference 
has been in "knockout" mice in which 
individual genes encoding neurotroph- 
ins or Trk receptors have been deleted. 
Although these genetic deletions have 
led to predictable deficits in the PNS 
(see text), generally they have had 
minimal impact on CNS structure and 
function. 
Thus, the role of neurotrophins in 
the central nervous system remains 
uncertain. One possibility is that, in the 
CNS, neurotrophins are more involved 
in regulating neuronal differentiation 
and phenotype than in supporting neu- 
ronal survival per se. In this regard, the 
expression of neurotrophins is tightly 
regulated by electrical and synaptic 
activity, suggesting that they may also 
influence experience-dependent pro- 
cesses during the formation of central 
nervous system circuits.

Conversely, injection of exogenous NGF into 
newborn rodents caused enlargement of sym- 
pathetic ganglia (which are particularly NGF-de- 
pendent) due to additional cells as well as more 
extensive axonal and dendritic growth, an effect 
opposite to that of NGF deprivation. Finally, once 
the protein and gene for NGF were identified, it 
was possible to show that NGF was indeed made 
available by the targets of the nerve cells that it 
acted upon. The dramatic influence of NGF on 
cell survival and its secretion from neuronal tar- 
gets, together with what was known about the 
significance of neuronal death and regulation of 
neurite growth in development, suggested that 
NGF is indeed a target-derived signal that serves 
to match the number of nerve cells to the number 
of target cells. 
NGF remains the most thoroughly stud- 
ied neurotrophic factor, but from the outset it 
was apparent that only certain classes of nerve 
cells respond to NGF. Furthermore, diversity of 
trophic factors most certainly would facilitate 
greater specificity between pre- and postsynap- 
tic partners during development (or in regener- 
ation; see Chapter 25). In the 1980s and 1990s, 
work from a number of laboratories showed 
that NGF belongs to a family of related tro- 
phic molecules referred to as the neurotroph- 
ins. Neurotrophins are functionally similar to 
_—_(B) 
a broader class of signaling molecules found 
throughout the organism, referred to generi- 
cally as "growth factors." The expression and 
activity of the neurotrophins, however, is mostly 
limited to neurons and their targets. At pres- 
ent, there are four well-characterized members 
of the neurotrophin family in addition to NGF: 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 
neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophins 
4 and 5 (NT-4/5) (Figure 23.14 and Box 23D). 
Although several neurotrophins are homolo- 
gous in amino acid sequence and structure, they 
are encoded by distinct genes and are very dif- 
ferent in their specificity (Figure 23.14A). For

in the ability of NGF to induce neurite outgrowth from sympathetic

glia. (B) Specific influence of neurotrophins in vivo. Distinct classes

example, NGF supports the survival of 
(and neurite outgrowth from) sympa- 
thetic neurons, while another family 
member—BDNF—cannot. Conversely, 
BDNF, but not NGF, can support the sur- 
vival of certain sensory ganglion neurons, 
which have a different embryonic origin. 
NT-3 supports both of these populations. 
Given the diverse systems whose growth 
and connectivity must be coordinated 
during neural development, this specific- 
ity makes good sense. Indeed, different 
neurotrophins are selectively available in 
different targets. For example, the differ- 
ent receptor specializations in the skin 
that transduce somatosensory informa- 
tion express different neurotrophins, and 
this specificity is matched by expression 
of neurotrophin receptors (see the next 
section) that distinguish the sensory neu- 
rons that innervate each distinct structure 
(Figure 23.14B). All of these neurotroph- 
ins also act in the central nervous system 
to regulate the number and growth of 
neurons; however, the local specificities 
of their CNS actions are not as well es- 
tablished as in the PNS. 
In addition to the neurotrophins, other 
secreted molecules also have neuro- 
trophic influences. These include the cili- 
ary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which is 
considered a cytokine because of its role 
in inflammation and immune responses 
beyond neurotrophic interactions; leuke- 
mia inhibitory factor (LIF), also a cyto- 
kine; and glial-derived neurotrophic fac- 
tor (GDNF) and related proteins (referred 
to as the GDNF family of ligands). GDNF 
ligands activate the RET tyrosine kinase 
receptor; they influence kidney develop-

sequence illustrates that neuritic growth can be locally controlled 
by neurotrophins that stimulate Ca** release. (C) Neurotrophin 
signaling at the axon is maintained and propagated by endocytic 
internalization of the ligand/receptor complex with several scaf- 
folding proteins that bind one of three intracellular effectors: the 
Akt kinase, phospholipase Cy (PLCy), or ERK kinases. This "signal- 
ing endosome" can also bind molecular motors that engage the 
microtubule cytoskeleton. The signaling endosome, activated via 
neurotrophin binding, is then transported back to the cell body to 
activate downstream targets, including modifying gene expres- 
sion. (A after Campenot, 1981; B from Li. et al., 2005; C after Zweifel 
et al., 2005.) 

neuronal differentiation. Thus, a variety of factors—some 
specific to the nervous system, others used for purposes 
beyond neural development—influence the survival and 
growth of developing nerve cells and therefore the elabo- 
ration of neural circuits. 
Neurotrophin Signaling 
Neurotrophic factors are clearly key regulators for three 
distinct cellular mechanisms: neural process growth/re- 
traction; synapse stabilization/elimination; and cell survival/ 
death. The ways in which these ligands influence different 
aspects of neuronal differentiation reflects the details of 
signal transduction in response to neurotrophic molecules. 
The specific role of NGF in axon growth was most dra- 
matically demonstrated by experiments that isolated NGF 
availability to subsets of neural processes without expos- 
ing the cell body to the factor (Figure 23.15A). The results 
of these experiments indicated that NGF acts locally to 
stimulate neurite growth—even while other processes of 
the same cell, deprived of NGF, are retracting. Apparently, 
general availability of NGF to an individual neuron does

not support growth of all of that neuron's processes. Similar 
observations have been made for other neurotrophins. For 
example, BDNF can influence neurite growth by altering lo- 
cal Ca** signaling in growth cones (Figure 23.15B). In addi- 
tion, physiological experiments indicate that NGF and other 
neurotrophins influence synaptic activity and plasticity (see 
Chapter 24), again independent of their effects on cell sur- 
vival. Finally, neurotrophins engage signaling pathways 
that protect cells from programmed cell death (apoptosis), 
and their absence activates signaling that leads to expres- 
sion and activity of apoptotic genes. These and related ef- 
fects depend on relaying the neurotrophic signal from the 
axon terminal to the cell body. To accomplish this relay, 
neurotrophins bound to their transmembrane receptors 
(primarily the Trk subset of receptors; see below) are selec- 
tively internalized by assembling a signaling endosome that 
also includes neurotrophins bound to the now-activated 
neurotrophin receptor/kinase, as well as an assembly of 
related signaling proteins (Figure 23.15C). This signaling 
endosome is transported back to the cell body. 
The selective actions of neurotrophins reflect their 
interactions with two classes of neurotrophin receptors: 
the tyrosine kinase (Trk) receptors and the p75 recep- 
tor. There are three Trk receptors, each of which is a single 
transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase 
domain. TrkA is primarily a receptor for NGF, TrkB is a 
receptor for BDNF and NT-4/5, and TrkC is a receptor for 
NT-3 (Figure 23.16). In addition, all neurotrophins acti- 
vate the p75 receptor protein. The interactions between 
neurotrophins, Trks, and p75 demonstrate another level 
of selectivity and specificity of neurotrophin signaling. All 
neurotrophins are secreted in an unprocessed form that 
undergoes subsequent proteolytic cleavage. The Trk recep- 
tors have high affinity for processed ligands, while the p75 
receptor has high affinity for unprocessed neurotrophins 
but low affinity for the processed ligands. The expression 
of a particular Trk receptor subtype or p75 therefore confers 
the capacity for distinct neurotrophin responses. Since Trk 
and p75 receptors are expressed only in subsets of neurons, 
and neurotrophins are available from different classes of 
targets (see Figure 23.14), selective binding between ligand 
and receptor likely accounts for some of the specificity of 
neurotrophic interactions. 
FIGURE 23.16 
Neurotrophin receptors and their specificity. (A) The Trk family of receptor tyro- 
sine kinases for the neurotrophins. TrkA is primarily a receptor for NGF, TrkB a receptor for BDNF and 
NT-4/5, and TrkC a receptor for NT-3. Because of the high degree of structural homology among both 
the neurotrophins and the Trk receptors, there is some degree of cross-activation between factors and 
receptors. For example, NT-3 can bind to and activate TrkB under some conditions, as indicated by the 
dashed arrow. These distinct receptors allow various neurons to respond selectively to the different neu- 
rotrophins. (B) The p75 low-affinity neurotrophin receptor binds all neurotrophins at low affinities (as its 
name implies). This receptor confers the ability to respond to a broad range of neurotrophins upon fairly 
broadly distributed classes of neurons in the peripheral and central nervous systems.

Trk receptors, via stimulation of their intercellular tyro- 
sine kinase domain and subsequent phosphorylation of tar- 
get proteins, engage three distinct second messenger path- 
ways that alter functions of proteins (via phosphorylation 
and other posttranslational modifications) or that change 
gene expression in the target cell (Figure 23.17A). These re- 
ceptors activate the small GTPase Ras, which then activates 
a family of cytoplasmic protein kinases—the mitogen acti- 
vated protein (MAP) kinases—to elicit a variety of cellular 
responses, including changes in gene expression. Signaling 
from the Trk receptors via Ras and MAP kinases is thought 
to regulate neurite outgrowth in response to neurotrophin 
signaling at the cell surface. Trk receptors also activate two 
enzymes that modify or release phospholipid second mes- 
sengers—phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphoinositol 3 
(PI3) kinase—that influence function of existing proteins in 
the cell or cause changes in gene expression. Phospholipase 
C-dependent signaling preferentially influences cellular re- 
sponses that lead to activity-dependent synapse plasticity 
(see Chapter 24). PI3 kinase interacts with pathways that 
regulate the activity of AKT, a cytoplasmic kinase that mod- 
ulates proteins that either prevent or promote cell death. 
The last of the neurotrophin receptors, P75, also engages 
three different intercellular signaling pathways. One of 
these is mediated by Rho GTPases (which function in much 
the same way as Ras) that influence neurite growth. The 
second P75-dependent pathway leads to activation of the

genes involved in apoptosis. Finally, P75 can also engage 
nuclear factor KB (NF-«B), which enhances expression of 
genes that promote cell survival. Thus, the final functional 
influence of any neurotrophin depends on (1) the receptor 
it encounters, and (2) that receptor's likelihood of engag- 
ing diverse intercellular signaling pathways that influence 
growth, change, or cell death. 
The subtlety and diversity of neuronal circuits is set dur- 
ing later stages of neural development-by different com- 
binations of neurotrophins, their receptors, and signal 
transduction mechanisms. These mechanisms in concert 
determine the numbers of neurons, their shape, and their 
patterns of connections. Presumably, disruption of these 
neurotrophin-dependent processes, either during develop- 
ment or in the adult brain, can result in neurodegenerative 
conditions in which neurons die due to lack of appropri- 
ate trophic support, or fail to make and maintain appro- 
priate connections due to failure to grow. Such disruption 
has devastating consequences for the circuits that the cells 
define and for the behaviors controlled by those circuits. 
Indeed, the pathogenic mechanisms of developmental dis- 
orders such as autism and schizophrenia, as well as neu- 
rodegenerative diseases as diverse as amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheim- 
er's diseases, may all reflect abnormalities of neurotrophic 
regulation.

Neurons in the developing brain must integrate a variety of 
signals to determine where to send their axons, what cells 
to form synapses upon, how many synapses to make and 
retain, and whether to live or die. A remarkable transient 
cellular specialization, the growth cone, is responsible for 
axon growth and guidance. Growth cones explore the em- 
bryonic environment and determine the direction of axon 
growth as well as recognizing appropriate targets. Their 
motile properties allow growth cones to approach, select, or 
avoid a target according to modulation of the actin and mi- 
crotubule cytoskeleton by numerous signaling mechanisms, 
many of which involve changes in intracellular Ca?*. The 
instructions that elicit growth cone responses come from

transmitted by neurotrophins, molecules made by neuronal 
targets in small quantities that bind to a variety of recep-

ences—cell survival or death, process growth, and modu- 
lation of synaptic activity—help determine which neurons 
remain in a neural circuit, how they are connected, and how 
they continue to change. Defects in the early guidance of 
axons or subsequent trophic regulation of synaptogenesis 
have been implicated in a variety of congenital neurological 
syndromes and developmental disorders, and neurotrophic 
dysfunction in the adult CNS may underlie degenerative 
pathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

MOopDIFICATION OF 
NEURAL CIRCUITS AS A 
RESULT OF EXPERIENCE 
Overview 
THE RICH DIVERSITY OF PERSONALITIES, abilities, and behaviors generated 
by individual human brains derives from both genetic and environmental influences 
on developing neural circuits. To achieve this diversity, patterns of neuronal activity, 
including those elicited by experience, modify the synaptic connections of the devel- 
oping brain established by the intrinsic cellular and molecular processes described in 
the previous two chapters. This activity-mediated influence is greatest during tem- 
poral windows called critical periods. As humans (and other mammals) mature, the 
cellular mechanisms that modify neural connectivity become less effective, and the 
brain becomes increasingly refractory to the lessons of experience. Many of the effects 
of postnatal activity are transduced via signaling pathways that modify intracellular 
calcium levels and thus influence local gene expression, neurotrophic interactions, 
and synapse growth and stability. Much of our knowledge of the influence of activ- 
ity on neural circuits comes from studies of the mammalian visual system, where 
differences in input from each eye influence patterns of connections in the visual 
cortex. Beyond the primary visual areas, changes in the structure of the human cere- 
bral cortex from birth through late adolescence indicate that experience-dependent 
mechanisms likely shape patterns of connectivity that influence complex behaviors. 
These mechanisms may be compromised in disorders that result in intellectual dis- 
ability, developmental delay, autism, or psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. 
Neural Activity and Brain Development 
In 1949, the psychologist D. O. Hebb hypothesized that the coordinated activity of a 
presynaptic terminal and a postsynaptic neuron strengthens the synaptic connection 
between them. Hebb's postulate, as it has come to be known, was originally formu- 
lated to explain the cellular basis of learning and memory, but the general concept 
has been widely applied to situations involving long-term modifications in synaptic 
strength, including those that occur during development of neural circuits. In this 
context, Hebb's postulate implies that synaptic terminals strengthened by correlated 
activity during development will be retained or sprout new branches, whereas those 
terminals that are persistently weakened by uncorrelated activity will eventually lose

Hebb's postulate and the 
development of synaptic inputs. In this 
drawing, a postsynaptic neuron is shown with 
two sets of presynaptic inputs, each with a differ- 
ent pattern of electrical activity. Activity patterns, 
Input

are represented by the short vertical bars. In the 
example here, the three correlated inputs at the 
top are better able to activate the postsynaptic 
cell. These inputs cause the postsynaptic cell to 
fire a pattern of action potentials that follows the 
Input 
pattern seen in the input. As a result, the activity 
2 
of the presynaptic terminals and the postsyn- 
aptic neuron is highly correlated. According to 
Hebb's postulate, these synapses are therefore 
strengthened. The two additional inputs relay a 
different pattern of activity that is less well corre- 
lated with the majority of the activity elicited in 
the postsynaptic cell. These synapses gradually 
weaken and are eventually eliminated (right- 
hand side of figure), while the correlated inputs 
form additional synapses. 
their hold on the postsynaptic cell (Figure 24.1; see also 
Chapter 22). 
This formulation of the role of activity in influencing the 
ongoing organization of neural circuits provided an initial 
clue to understanding two obvious phenomena in brain 
development. First, behaviors not initially present in new- 
borns emerge and are shaped by experience throughout 
early life; and second, the brain continues to grow after 
birth. Clearly, the combined contribution of cellular changes 
in pre- and postsynaptic elements and the resulting change 
in patterns of action potential firing by individual neurons 
must have a central role in these two processes. The parallel 
growth of dendritic and axonal branches and the addition 
of synaptic connections early in life must account for a sig- 
nificant portion of postnatal brain growth (Figure 24.2A,B) 
and perhaps provide a substrate for enhanced behavioral 
capacities. Not surprisingly—especially if Hebb's postulate 
is correct—there is a subsequent decline in synapse num- 
ber during adolescence (see Figure 24.2B). This suggests 
that synaptic connections and related neuronal growth are 
the ultimate targets of activity-dependent change during 
early postnatal life—initially for progressive construction, 
and subsequently for selective elimination of connections. 
From birth through early adulthood, these events occur in 
synchrony with the acquisition of sensory and motor abili- 
ties, the capacity for social interaction, and increasingly so- 
phisticated cognitive behaviors. These coincidences suggest 
that the combination of activity-dependent modification of 
connections initially suggested by Hebb and corresponding 
brain growth and behavioral changes during early life must 
underlie how each individual's brain ultimately develops to 
meet the challenges of adapting to a dynamic environment.

The electrical activity initiated by exposure and interac- 
tion with the environment following birth is a key element 
in the construction of any individual's nervous system. In- 
trinsic mechanisms (including those that constrain axon 
growth, initiate the formation of topographic maps, and 
establish the first synapses; see Chapter 23) establish the 
general circuitry required for most behaviors. These cellular 
and molecular mechanisms, however, do not yield a final 
pattern of connectivity. "Normal" experiences evidently 
validate initial wiring and preserve, augment, or adjust the 
normal arrangement. In the case of "abnormal" experi- 
ences, the mechanisms allowing these adjustments result 
in more dramatic anatomical (and ultimately behavioral) 
changes. Presumably, such changes facilitate maximal 
adaptive function of the nervous system in the face of a 
radically altered environment or a compromised capacity of 
the individual to acquire information from the environment 
(e.g., sensory impairments such blindness or deafness). The 
eventual decline of the capacity to remodel cortical (and 
subcortical) connections most likely explains changes in the 
capacity of the brain to acquire new information and di- 
rect new behaviors over a lifetime—a concept with obvious 
educational, psychiatric, and social implications. 
Critical Periods 
For most animals, the behavioral repertoire for basic sur- 
vival, including foraging, fighting, and mating strategies, 
largely relies on patterns of connectivity established by 
intrinsic developmental mechanisms. Indeed, embryonic 
mechanisms and their developmental consequences are 
sufficient to create some remarkably sophisticated innate

or "instinctual" behaviors, including the complex reper- 
toire for parental identification, feeding, and responding to 
predators seen in newborn birds and mammals (Box 24A; 
see also Box 31A). Nevertheless, the nervous systems of 
animals with increasingly complex repertoires of behaviors, 
including humans, clearly adapt to and are influenced by 
the particular circumstances of an individual's environment 
beyond innate behavioral capacities. These environmental 
factors are especially influential in early life, during tem- 
poral windows called critical periods—the time when 
experience and neural activity that reflects that experience 
have maximal effect on the acquisition or skilled execution 
of a particular behavior. Some behaviors, such as parental 
imprinting in hatchling birds (the event by which the hatch- 
ling recognizes its "parent") are expressed only if animals 
have certain specific experiences during a sharply restricted 
time (hours or days) in early postnatal (or posthatching) 
development (see Box 24A). On the other hand, critical 
periods for sensorimotor skills and complex behaviors last 
longer and end far less abruptly. In some cases, such as 
the acquisition of language in humans, detailed instructive 
influences from the environment (i.e., exposure to language 
and opportunities for mimicry and repetition) are required 
for an extended period to ensure normal development of 
the behavior. The availability of instructive experiences 
from the environment, as well as the neural capacity to 
respond to them, is key for successful completion of the 
critical period. These instructive influences are paralleled in 
some non-human species in which complex communica- 
tion is important for territorial and reproductive behaviors. 
In some songbirds, male birds acquire the capacity to pro- 
duce species-specific song by mimicking tutor birds during 
a limited period of postnatal life (Box 24B). If this essential 
instruction is withheld or disrupted, the birds are not effec- 
tive in using communication to define their territories and 
compete for mates. 
Although they vary widely in both their duration and 
the behaviors affected, all critical periods share some basic 
properties. Each critical period encompasses the time dur- 
ing which a given behavior is especially susceptible to—in- 
deed, requires—specific environmental influences in order 
to develop normally. These influences can be as subtle as 
the ongoing stimuli of light or sound encountered by an 
infant, or the precisely articulated instruction in one's native 
(or a foreign) language required to achieve fluent speech 
and accurate comprehension. Once a critical period ends, 
the core features of the behavior are largely unaffected by 
subsequent experience. Conversely, failure to be exposed 
to appropriate stimuli during the critical period is difficult 
or impossible to remedy subsequently. In most mammals, 
including humans, critical periods seem to rely particularly 
upon changes in organization and function of circuits in the 
cerebral cortex. Thus, much of our subsequent discussion of 
critical periods will focus on the consequences of experience

CHAPTER 24 
BOX 24A Built-In Behaviors 
_ The idea that animals possess an innate 
_ set of behaviors appropriate for a 
_ world not yet experienced has always 
been difficult to accept. However, the 
| preeminence of instinctual responses 
_ is obvious to any biologist who looks 
at what animals actually do. Perhaps 
_ the most thoroughly studied examples 
occur in young birds. Hatchlings 
_ emerge from the egg with an elaborate 
_ set of innate behaviors. First, of course, 
_ is the complex behavior that allows the 
- chick to escape from the egg. Having 
- emerged, a variety of additional abili- 
ties indicate how much early behavior is 
"preprogrammed." 
In a series of seminal observations 
based on his work with geese, Konrad 
_ Lorenz showed that goslings follow 
the first large, moving object they see 
and hear during their first day of life. 
Although this object is normally the 
mother goose, Lorenz found that gos- 
lings will imprint on a wide range of 
animate and inanimate objects present- 
ed during this period, including Lorenz 
himself. The window for imprinting in 
goslings is less than a day; if animals 
are not exposed to an appropriate stim- 
ulus during this time, they will never 
form the appropriate parental relation- 
ship. Once imprinting occurs, however, 
it is irreversible, and geese will continue 
to follow inappropriate objects (male 
conspecifics, people, or even inanimate 
objects). 
In many mammals, auditory and 
visual systems are poorly developed at 
birth, and maternal imprinting relies 
on olfactory and/or gustatory cues. For 
example, during the first week of life 
(but not later), infant rats develop a 
lifelong preference for odors associated 
with their mother's nipples. As in birds, 
this filial imprinting plays a role in their 
social development and later sexual 
preferences. 
Imprinting is a two-way street, with 
parents (especially mothers) rapidly

geese. (Photograph courtesy of H. Kacher.) 
forming exclusive bonds with their off- 
spring. This phenomenon is especially 
important in animals such as sheep that 
live in large groups or herds in which 
all the females produce offspring at 
about the same time of year. Ewes have 
a critical period 2-4 hours after giving 
birth during which they imprint on the 
scent of their own lamb. After about 4 
hours, they rebuff approaches by other 
lambs. 
The relevance of this work to pri- 
mates was underscored in the 1950s by 
Harry Harlow and his colleagues at the 
University of Wisconsin. Harlow isolat- 
ed monkeys within a few hours of birth 
and raised them in the absence of either 
a natural mother or a human substitute. 
In the best known of these experi- 
ments, the baby monkeys had one of 
two maternal surrogates: a "mother" 
~ 
constructed of a wooden frame cov- 
ered with wire mesh that supported a 
nursing bottle, or a similarly shaped 
object covered with soft terrycloth but 
without any source of nourishment for 
the young monkey. When presented 
with this choice, the baby monkeys 
preferred the terrycloth mother and 
spent much of their time clinging to 
it, even though the feeding bottle was 
with the wire mother. Harlow took this 
to mean that newborn monkeys have 
a built-in need for maternal care and 
have at least some innate idea of what 
a mother should feel like. A number of 
other endogenous behaviors have been 
studied in infant monkeys, including 
a naive monkey's fear reaction to the 
presentation of certain objects (e.g., 
a snake) and the "looming" response 
(fear elicited by the rapid approach of 
any formidable object). Most of these 
built-in behaviors have analogs in 
human infants. 
Taken together, these observations 
make plain that many complicated 
behaviors, emotional responses, and 
other predilections are well established 
in the nervous system prior to any sig- 
nificant experience, and that the need 
for certain kinds of early experience for 
normal development is predetermined. 
These built-in behaviors and their neu- 
ral substrates have presumably evolved 
to give newborns a better chance of 
surviving in a reliably dangerous world.

_ Anyone witnessing a child learning to 
talk cannot help but be amazed at how 
quickly language development takes 
place. This facility contrasts with the 
adult acquisition of a new language, 
_ which can be a painfully slow process 
and rarely, if ever, produces complete 
fluency. In fact, many learned behaviors 
are acquired during a critical period in 
early life when experience exerts an 
especially potent influence on subse- 
quent behavior. Particularly well charac- 
terized is the critical period for learning 
courtship songs by oscine songbirds 
such as canaries and finches. In these 
species, the quality of early sensory 
exposure is the major determinant of 
subsequent perceptual and behavioral 
capabilities. Furthermore, developmen- 
tal periods for learning these and other 
behaviors are restricted during post- 
natal life, suggesting that the nervous 
system changes in some manner to 
become refractory to further experience. 
Understanding how critical periods 
are regulated has many implications,

not least the possibility of reactivating 
enhanced learning capacity in adults. 
Such periods are often highly special- 
ized for the acquisition of species-typical 
behaviors, however, and are not merely 
times of general enhanced learning. 
Avian song learning illustrates the 
interactions between intrinsic and 
environmental factors in this devel- 
opmental process. Many birds sing to 
attract mates, but oscine songbirds are 
special in that their courtship songs are 
dependent on auditory and vocal expe- 
rience. The sensitive period for song 
learning comprises an initial stage of 
sensory acquisition, when the juvenile 
bird listens to and memorizes the song 
of a nearby adult male tutor (usually 
of its own species), and a subsequent 
stage of vocal learning, when the young 
bird matches its own song to the now- 
memorized tutor model via auditory 
feedback. This sensory motor learning 
stage ends with the onset of sexual 
maturity, when songs become acousti- 
cally stable, or crystallized. In all species 
(C) 
studied to date, young songbirds are 
especially impressionable during the 
first 2 months after hatching and 
become refractory to further exposure 
to tutor song as they age. The impact of 
this early experience is profound, and 
the memory it generates can remain 
intact for months, perhaps years, before 
the onset of the vocal practice phase. 
Even constant exposure to other songs 
after sensory acquisition during the 
sensitive period ends does not affect 
this memory. The songs heard dur- 
ing sensory acquisition, but not later, 
are those that the bird vocally mimics. 
Early auditory experience is crucial to 
the bird's Darwinian success. In the 
absence of a tutor, or if raised only in 
the presence of another species, birds 
produce highly abnormal "isolate" 
songs or songs of the foster species, 
neither of which succeeds in attracting 
females of their own kind. 
Two other features of song learning 
indicate an intrinsic predisposition for

Cellular and Molecular Correlates 
of Activity-Dependent Plasticity 
during Critical Periods 
In order to understand how experience changes neural cir- 
cuits during critical periods, we need to know how patterns 
of activity are transduced to modify connections and make 
those modifications permanent. Clearly, the steps that initi- 
ate these processes must rely on signals generated by syn- 
aptic activity associated with sensory experience, perceptual 
and cognitive processing, or motor performance. Neu- 
rotransmitters and a number of other signaling molecules, 
including neurotrophic factors, are obvious candidates for 
initiating the changes that occur with correlated or repeated 
activity, including that driven by experience. Indeed, mice 
that lack genes for a number of neurotransmitter-synthe- 
sizing or degrading enzymes exhibit changes in experience- 
dependent plasticity of the visual cortex and other cortical 
regions. Without doubt, the effects of correlated excitatory 
neurotransmission, particularly that via glutamate trans- 
duced by NMDA receptors (which are capable of detecting 
local correlated synaptic activity and modifying signaling 
in the postsynaptic cell; see Chapter 8), are key for under- 
standing activity-dependent competition and circuit modi- 
fication during development as well as synaptic plasticity in 
the adult. Similarly, the local and global effects of modified 
neurotrophin signaling include altered synaptic plasticity 
during critical periods. Thus, when these signaling mol- 
ecules are manipulated experimentally, or when the genes 
encoding neurotrophic ligands or receptors are mutated, 
some critical period phenomena are altered. One major tar- 
get of all of these molecular signaling processes is appar- 
ently the network of local inhibitory connections made by 
GABAergic neurons. Regulation of the number and place- 
ment of local inhibitory synapses, as well as the expression 
of GABA receptors at postsynaptic sites, all seems to be 
copy the song of their own species, 
even with no external reinforcement.

exquisitely sensitive to changes in levels of electrical activity 
during early postnatal life. Thus, the activity and experi- 
ence-dependent regulation of inhibitory connectivity has 
become a major focus for understanding the molecular and 
cellular mechanisms of activity and experience-dependent 
postnatal construction of neural circuits. 
Intriguingly, neurotransmitters and other secreted mole- 
cules (such as neurotrophins) that influence critical periods 
are all thought ultimately to modulate levels of intracel- 
lular Ca?*, particularly in postsynaptic cells (Figure 24.3). 
Increased Ca? in the affected cells can activate a number of 
kinases, including Ca**/calmodulin kinase (CaMK) II or IV, 
leading to phosphorylation-dependent modifications of the 
cytoskeleton and changes in dendritic and axonal branch- 
ing. In addition, changes in Ca** can activate other kinases 
that translocate to the nucleus, including the extracellular 
signal-regulated kinases (ERKs; see Chapter 7). Once in- 
side the nucleus, ERKs can activate transcription factors 
such as CREB (cyclic nucleotide response element binding 
transcription factor) via phosphorylation. Particularly dur- 
ing critical periods, these kinases may facilitate activation 
of histone-modifying enzymes, leading to chromatin con- 
formations that enhance gene expression—including genes 
that are essential for synapse construction or stabilization. 
Such changes may include (but are unlikely to be limited 
to) transcription of neurotrophin genes such as BDNF. As 
the critical period draws to a close, it is possible that such 
modification of chromatin-binding proteins diminishes, 
thus making altered transcription (and corresponding plas- 
tic changes) more difficult. 
Local increase of neurotrophins, especially if secretion 
is limited to synapses from "stabilized" inputs, may lead to 
greater local elaboration of synaptic endings, additional den- 
dritic growth, and the net increase of connectivity between 
pre- and postsynaptic partners. GABAergic interneurons are 
particularly sensitive to altered BDNF signaling. This is con- 
sistent with the presumed role for local inhibitory circuits in 
consolidating the connections that are sorted out by activity- 
dependent competitive interactions during the critical pe- 
riod. It is also possible that activity-dependent mechanisms

signaling. (A) A target neuron, showing two possible sites of action—the cell soma and

or sustained activity leads to increased Ca** conductances and increased intracellular 
Ca?+ concentration, which results in activation of Ca?*/calmodulin kinase II or IV (CaMKII/ 
IV) as well as ERK, and their subsequent translocation to the nucleus. ERK and CaMKIl/ 
IV then activate Ca?*-regulated transcription factors such as CREB, as well as other chro- 
matin binding proteins (not shown). The target genes for activated CREB may include 
neurotrophic signals such as BDNF, which when secreted by a cell may help stabilize or 
promote the growth of active synapses on that cell. (C) Local increases in Ca'* signaling 
in distal dendrites due to correlated or sustained activity may lead to local increases in 
Ca?* concentration that modify cytoskeletal elements (actin- or tubulin-based structures), 
perhaps through the activity of kinases such as CaMKII/IV operating in the cytoplasm 
rather than the nucleus. Changes in these cytoskeletal elements lead to local changes in 
dendritic structure. In addition, increased local Ca** concentration may influence local 
translation of transcripts in the endoplasmic reticulum, including transcripts for neu- 
rotransmitter receptors and other modulators of postsynaptic responses. Increased Ca** 
may also influence the trafficking of these proteins, their insertion into the postsynaptic 
membrane, and their interaction with local scaffolds for cytoplasmic proteins (see Figure

distribution of matrix components (includ- 
ing chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) and 
enzymes that can modify or cleave these 
molecules. These matrix molecules and 
modulating enzymes might further influ- 
ence the location and stability of subsets of 
synapses. Whether this sequence is correct 
or complete remains uncertain, but it pro- 
vides a plausible scenario for the molecular 
and cellular events underlying activity-de- 
pendent plasticity. 
Critical Periods in Visual 
System Development 
Fundamental understanding of how 
changes in connectivity might contribute 
to critical periods that influence behav- 
ioral capacity has come from studies of the 
developing visual system in animals with 
highly developed visual abilities, particu- 
larly cats and monkeys. The work of Da- 
vid Hubel and Torsten Wiesel provided 
key observations that defined how activity 
and experience shape connections in the 
primary visual cortex. This work, which in 
1982 led to a Nobel Prize in Physiology or 
Medicine for Hubel and Wiesel, was pur- 
sued in the visual system because this sys- 
tem is extremely amenable to the sorts of 
experimental manipulations necessary to 
test the relationship between experience, 
activity, and circuitry. 
It is relatively easy to either deprive or 
augment visual experience in an experi- 
mental animal; eyes can be sutured shut, 
or animals can be reared in illumination 
conditions ranging from total darkness to 
maximal light. Such control of sensory ex- 
perience is almost impossible in any other 
modality—it is much harder to deprive 
an animal of auditory, somatosensory, 
olfactory, or taste stimuli. Moreover, the 
organization of the visual pathways pro- 
vides ideal opportunities to evaluate how 
experience influences ongoing function 
and connections. Information from the 
two eyes is first integrated in the primary 
visual (striate) cortex (see Chapters 11 and 
12), where most afferents from the lateral 
geniculate nucleus of the thalamus ter- 
minate. In some mammals—carnivores, 

BOX 24C Transneuronal Labeling with Radioactive Amino Acids 
Unlike many brain structures, ocular 
~ dominance columns are not easily vis- 
ible by means of conventional histol- 
_ ogy. Thus, the striking cortical patterns 
evident in cats and monkeys were 
- not seen until the early 1970s, when 
_ the technique of anterograde trac- 
_ ing using radioactive amino acids was 
_ introduced. In this approach, an amino 
- acid commonly found in proteins (usu- 
ally proline) is radioactively tagged 
_ and injected into the area of interest. 
Neurons in the vicinity take up the 
label from the extracellular space and 
_ incorporate it into newly made proteins. 
- Some of these proteins are involved in 
the maintenance and function of the 
neuron's synaptic terminals; thus, they 
_ 
are shipped via anterograde axonal 
transport from the cell body to nerve 
terminals, where they accumulate. 
After a suitable interval, the tissue is 
Transneuronal transport. A neuron in the 
retina is shown taking up a radioactive 
amino acid, incorporating it into proteins, 
and moving the proteins down the axons 
and across the extracellular space between 
neurons. This process is repeated in the 
thalamus and, eventually, the label accu- 
mulates in the thalamocortical terminals in 
layer 4 of the primary visual cortex.

anthropoid primates, and humans—the afferent terminals 
form an alternating series of eye-specific domains in cortical 
layer 4 called ocular dominance columns (Figure 24.4), 
Ocular dominance columns can be visualized by injecting 
tracers such as radioactive amino acids into one eye; the 
tracer is then transported along the visual pathway to spe- 
cifically label the geniculocortical terminals (i.e., synaptic 
terminals in the visual cortex) corresponding to that eye 
fixed and sections are made, placed on 
glass slides, and coated with a sensitive 
photographic emulsion. The radioactive 
decay of the labeled amino acids in the 
proteins causes silver grains to form in 
the emulsion. After several months of 
exposure, a heavy concentration of sil- 
ver grains accumulates over the regions 
that contain synapses originating from 
the injected site. For example, injections 
into the eye will heavily label the termi- 
nal fields of retinal ganglion cells in the 
lateral geniculate nucleus. 
Transneuronal transport takes this 
process a step further. After tagged 
proteins injected into living animals 
reach the axon terminals, a fraction is 
actually released into the extracellular 
space, where the proteins are degraded 
into amino acids or small peptides 
that retain their radioactivity. An even 
smaller fraction of this pool of labeled 
amino acids is taken up by the postsyn- 
aptic neurons, incorporated again into 
proteins, and transported to synaptic 
terminals of the second set of neurons. 
Because the label passes from the pre- 
synaptic terminals of one set of cells to 
the postsynaptic target cells, the process 
is called transneuronal transport. By 
such transneuronal labeling, the chain

of connections originating from a par- 
ticular structure can be visualized. In 
the case of the visual system, proline 
injections into one eye label appropriate 
layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus 
(as well as other retinal ganglion cell 
targets such as the superior colliculus), 
and subsequently the terminals in the 
visual cortex of the geniculate neurons 
receiving inputs from that eye. Thus, 
when sections of the visual cortex are 
viewed with dark-field illumination to 
make the silver grains glow a brilliant 
white against the unlabeled back- 
ground, ocular dominance columns in 
layer 4 are easily seen (see Figure 24.4).

and respond to visual stimuli seen by both eyes. Ocular 
dominance is thus seen in the domains (stripes) in cortical 
layer 4, in which all neurons are driven exclusively by one 
eye or the other; and by the degree that individual corti- 
cal neurons beyond layer 4 (i.e., in layers 2-3 and 5-6) are 
driven by both eyes. The clarity of these patterns of con- 
nectivity and the precision by which experience via the two 
eyes can be manipulated led to the series of experiments 
described in the following section. These experiments 
ereatly clarified the neurobiological processes underlying 
critical periods, integrating changes in functional innerva- 
tion with change in patterns of connectivity. 
Effects of Visual Deprivation on 
Ocular Dominance 
The clear distinctions between activation of visual cortical 
neurons by one or the other eye via the retino-geniculo- 
cortical pathways have been the primary measure of how 
peripheral experience influences visual development. As

the primary visual cortex of an adult macaque. The 
diagram illustrates the labeling procedure (see also Box 24C). 
Following transynaptic transport of the radioactive label, the 
distribution of ipsilateral (I) versus contralateral (C) retinal 
ganglion cell axon terminals is seen in the lateral geniculate 
nucleus (LGN; lower left). Geniculocortical terminals (from the 
labeled LGN layers) related to the injected eye are visible as a 
pattern of light stripes in an autoradiogram (lower right) of a 
section through layer 4 in the plane of the cortex (that is, as if 
looking down on the cortical surface). The dark areas are the 
zones occupied by geniculocortical terminals related to the 
unlabeled eye. (LGN micrograph courtesy P. Rakic; ocular dom- 
inance columns from LeVay, Wiesel, and Hubel, 1980.) 
described in Chapter 12, if an electrode 
is passed at a shallow angle through the 
cortex while the responses of individual 
neurons to light stimulation of one or the 
other eye are being recorded, detailed 
assessment of ocular dominance can be 
made at the level of individual cells (see 
Figure 12.11). The original studies of vi- 
sual cortical plasticity and critical periods 
were performed using a similar physi- 
ological approach. Accordingly, visual 
cortical neurons were divided into seven 
"ocular dominance" groups based on 
their degree of response to either the con- 
tralateral or ipsilateral eye (Figure 24.5). 
Group 1 cells are driven only by stimulation of the contra- 
lateral eye; group 7 cells are driven entirely by the ipsilat- 
eral eye, and neurons driven equally well by either eye are 
assigned to group 4. Based on this measurement scheme, 
ocular dominance distribution in all layers but layer 4 in 
primary visual cortex is roughly Gaussian in a normal adult 
subject (cats were used in these experiments). Most cells 
were activated to some degree by both eyes (distributed 
around a mean defined by "group 4" cells), and about a 
quarter were more activated by either the contralateral or 
ipsilateral eye (Figure 24.5A). 
This normal distribution of ocular dominance at the level 
of single cortical neurons can be altered by visual experience. 
When one eye of a kitten was sutured closed early in life and 
the animal then matured to adulthood (which takes about 
6 months), a remarkable change was observed. Once the 
eyelid was opened, electrophysiological recordings showed 
that very few cortical cells could be driven from the de- 
prived (previously sutured) eye. Recordings from the retina 
and lateral geniculate layers in response to direct electrical

Effect of early eyelid closure of one eye on 
the distribution of cortical neurons driven by stimulation

one of the seven ocular dominance categories, defined based 
on the frequency of action potential activity elicited from visual 
cortical neurons following illumination in the relevant eye. In all 
three cases, the experimental readings were performed on cats 38 
months after birth, at which time a penlight was shined into both 
wide-open eyes to elicit responses in the visual cortex. (A) Ocular 
dominance distribution of single-unit recordings from a large num- 
ber of neurons in the primary visual cortex of normal adult cats. 
Cells in group 1 were activated exclusively by the contralateral eye, 
cells in group 7 by the ipsilateral eye. There were no cells that were 
not responsive (NR) to light stimulation in the retina. (B) One eye 
stimulation in the deprived eye (as opposed to light-elicited 
electrical responses) indicated that these more peripheral 
stations in the visual pathway worked quite normally. Nev- 
ertheless, the ocular dominance distribution in the visual 
cortex had shifted; the eye that remained open was uniquely 
able to drive most cortical cells (Figure 24.5B). Thus, the ab- 
sence of cortical cells that responded to stimulation of the 
closed eye was not a result of retinal degeneration or a loss 
of retinal connections to the thalamus. Rather, the deprived 
of a newborn kitten was closed from 1 week after birth until 2.5 
months of age. After 2.5 months, the eye was opened and the kit- 
ten matured normally to 38 months. Note that the deprivation was 
relatively brief—the sutured eye had been open for 35.5 months 
of the cat's life. Even so, light presented to the open but transiently 
deprived eye elicited no electrical responses in visual cortical neu- 
rons. The only visually responsive cells responded to the ipsilateral 
(non-deprived) eye. (C) A much longer period of monocular depri- 
vation in an adult cat showed little effect on ocular dominance, 
although overall cortical activity is diminished. Most of the respon- 
sive cells were driven by both eyes. In addition, some cells (groups 
1 and 2) are uniquely or mostly responsive to the deprived eye.

eye had been functionally disconnected from the visual cor- 
tex. Consequently, such animals are behaviorally blind in 
the deprived eye. This "cortical blindness," or amblyopia, is 
permanent (see next section). Even if the formerly deprived 
eye remains open, little or no recovery occurs. 
Remarkably, the same manipulation—closing one eye— 
performed in adulthood has no effect on the responses 
of cells in the mature visual cortex. (Figure 24.5C). If one 
eye of an adult cat was closed for a year or more, both the

ocular dominance distribution measured across all cortical 
layers and the animal's visual behavior were indistinguish- 
able from normal when tested through the reopened eye. 
Thus, sometime between when a kitten's eyes open (about 
a week after birth) and 1 year of age, visual experience de- 
termines how the visual cortex is wired with respect to eye 
dominance. At the height of this critical period (about 4 
weeks of age in a cat), as little as 3 or 4 days of eye closure 
profoundly alters the ocular dominance profile of the striate 
cortex (Figure 24.6). After this time, deprivation or manipu- 
lation has little or no permanent, detectable effect. In fact,

FIGURE 24.6 
Consequences of a short period of 
monocular deprivation at the height of the criti- 
cal period in the cat. (A) Just 3 days of deprivation 
produced a significant shift of cortical activation in favor 
of the non-deprived eye. (B) Six days of deprivation 
produced a shift of cortical activation in favor of the non- 
deprived eye that is almost as complete as that elicited 
by 2.5 months of deprivation (see Figure 24.5B). (After 
Hubel and Wiesel, 1970.) 
eye closure is effective only if the deprivation occurs 
during the first 3 months of a kitten's life. In keeping 
with the ethological observations described earlier in 
the chapter, Hubel and Wiesel called this period of sus- 
ceptibility to visual deprivation the critical period for 
ocular dominance development. Similar experiments 
in monkeys have shown that the same phenomenon 
occurs in primates, although the critical period is longer 
(up to about 6 months of age). 
Visual deprivation during the critical period must 
result in cortical connectivity changes that influence 
the functional response properties of individual neu- 
rons—especially since neither retinal nor retinogenicu- 
late activity is altered. Subsequent anatomical studies 
established that the physiological changes were due to 
changes in patterns of connections. In monkeys, the 
stripelike pattern of geniculocortical axon terminals 
in layer 4 that defines ocular dominance columns is 
already present at birth, and this pattern reflects the 
functional segregation of inputs from the two eyes 
(Figure 24.7A; also see Figure 24.4). Indeed, the early 
formation of this pattern in layer 4 reflects a significant 
amount of segregation of the lateral geniculate nucleus 
axons that relay information from one eye or the other,

vation on the pattern of ocular domi- 
nance columns in the macaque. (A) In 
normal monkeys, ocular dominance columns 
are seen as alternating stripes of roughly 
equal width. (B) The picture is quite different 
after monocular deprivation. This dark-field 
autoradiograph shows a reconstruction of 
several sections through layer 4 of the prima- 
ry visual cortex of a monkey whose right eye 
was sutured shut from 2 weeks to 18 months 
of age, when the animal was sacrificed. Two 
weeks before death, the normal (left) eye was 
injected with radiolabeled amino acids (see 
Box 24C). The columns related to the non- 
deprived eye (white stripes) are much wider 
than normal; those related to the deprived 
eye are shrunken. (A from Horton and 
Hocking, 1999; B from Hubel et al., 1977.) 

548 
CHAPTER 24 
and this early segregation occurs even in the absence of 
meaningful visual experience. Subsequent observations 
have confirmed this initial experience-independent segre- 
gation, and there is some indication that specific molecular 
signals may distinguish LGN cells innervated by one eye or 
the other. In addition, spontaneous electrical activity, which 
occurs independently in each retina, may influence this 
non-visually guided process of early segregation. Thus, the 
visual cortex is clearly not a blank slate on which the effects 
of experience are inscribed. Nevertheless, animals deprived 
from birth of vision in one eye develop abnormal patterns 
of ocular dominance stripes in the visual cortex, presumably 
due to the altered patterns of activity caused by deprivation 
(Figure 24.7B). The stripes related to the open eye are sub- 
stantially wider, and the stripes representing the deprived 
eye are correspondingly diminished. The absence of cortical 
neurons that respond physiologically to the deprived eye is 
not simply a result of the relatively inactive inputs wither- 
ing away. If this were the case, one would expect to see 
areas of layer 4 devoid of any thalamic innervation. Instead, 
inputs from the active (open) eye take over some—but not 
all—of the territory that formerly belonged to the inactive 
(closed) eye. These inputs then dominate the physiological 
responses of the target cortical neurons. 
These results suggest competitive interaction between 
the two eyes during the critical period, reminiscent of Hebb's 
description of synaptic plasticity but in the context of devel- 
opment. In normal animals the equivalent amount of syn- 
aptic territory driven by each eye is retained (and sharpened 
in terms of segregation of ocular dominance stripes in layer 
4 of the cortex) if both eyes experience roughly comparable 
levels of visual stimulation. However, when an imbalance in 
visual experience is induced by monocular deprivation, the 
active eye gains a competitive advantage and replaces many 
of the synaptic inputs from the closed eye. In this case, even 
though LGN axons arising from neurons innervated by the

closed eye are retained in the cortex (albeit with much less 
extensive terminals and fewer functional synapses), few if 
any neurons fire action potentials when light is presented 
to the deprived eye. These observations in experimen- 
tal animals have important implications for children with 
birth defects or ocular injuries that result in an imbalance 
of inputs from the two eyes. Unless the imbalance is cor- 
rected during the critical period, the child may ultimately 
have poor binocular fusion, diminished depth perception, 
and degraded acuity; in other words, the child's vision may 
be significantly and permanently impaired. 
The idea that a competitive imbalance underlies the al- 
tered distribution of inputs after deprivation has been con- 
firmed by suturing shut both eyes shortly after birth. This 
manipulation equally deprives all visual cortical neurons of 
normal experience during the critical period. The arrange- 
ment of ocular dominance recorded some months later is, 
by either electrophysiological or anatomical criteria, much 
closer to normal than if just one eye is closed. Thus, the 
balance of inputs, not the absolute level of activity, is a key 
feature for shaping the normal pattern of connections. Al- 
though several peculiarities in the response properties of 
cortical cells deprived of normal light-dependent vision 
are apparent, roughly normal proportions of neurons re- 
sponsive to the two eyes are present. Because there is no 
imbalance in visual activity (both sets of related cortical in- 
puts being deprived), both eyes retain their territory in the 
cortex. If disuse atrophy of the closed-eye inputs were the 
main effect of deprivation, then binocular deprivation dur- 
ing the critical period would cause the visual cortex to be 
largely unresponsive. 
Experiments using techniques that label individual axons 
from distinct layers in the lateral geniculate nucleus have 
shown in greater detail what happens to the arborizations of 
individual lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons in layer 
4 of visual cortex after visual deprivation (Figure 24.8). At the

od, axons terminating in layer 4 of the primary

of branches compared with those from the 
open eye. (B) Deprivation for longer periods

level of single axons, loss of cortical territory related to the 
deprived eye and concomitant expansion of the open eye's 
territory are reflected in decreased size and complexity of the 
arborizations of LGN neurons related to the deprived eye, 
and increased growth and complexity of the arborizations 
related to the open eye (i.e., those arising from LGN cells 
innervated by the open eye). Individual axon arbors can be 
substantially altered after as little as 1 week of deprivation. 
This finding highlights the ability of developing thalamic 
and cortical neurons to rapidly remodel their connections 
(presumably making and breaking synapses) in response to 
environmental circumstances during the critical period. 
In the visual system, the action potentials of the thala- 
mocortical inputs related to one eye are presumably bet- 
ter correlated with each other than with the activity related 
to the other eye—at least in layer 4. If sets of correlated 
inputs tend to dominate the activity of groups of locally 
connected postsynaptic cells, this relationship would ex- 
clude uncorrelated inputs (Box 24D describes a particularly 
striking example of this principle). Thus, patches of cortex 
Any good statistician will tell an eager 
student "correlation is not causation." 
In other words, it is not wise to draw 
strong conclusions solely from the coin- 
cidence of two events occurring in the 
same place at the same time. While this 
is wise advice for cautiously interpreting 
a link between the increase in urban ice 
cream sales and street crime, it is less 
useful for considering the implications 
of how correlated neural activity leads 
to segregated patterns of connectivity. 
The causal role for correlation of neural 
activity with the generation of periodic 
segregated patterns of inputs—such as 
ocular dominance columns in the visual 
cortex—was given compelling support 
by creating, experimentally, a situation 
in which two sets of highly correlated 
inputs were forced to innervate a target 
territory that normally receives input 
from only one source. This sort of "aug- 
mentation" experiment is the equiva- 
lent of "gain-of-function" experiments

Thus, while most investigators 
agreed that the consequences of visual

removal (the "loss of function" experi- 
ment) pointed toward a primary role for 
correlated activity shaping connections 
in the visual system, the definitive "gain

opportunity for each), but adequate dif- 
ferences in correlated activity between 
each eye to facilitate competition and, 
potentially, segregation of connections.

_ eye was able to differentiate somewhat 
_ normally. It generated all of the usual 
_ retinal cell types, was sensitive to light, 
~ and made neuronal connections with 
_ the central target structure of the two 
- normal eyes—the optic tectum (the 
_ equivalent of the superior colliculus in 
_ mammals). This experimental oddity 
provided the long sought "augmenta- 
_ tion" experiment. Moreover, the experi- 
ment demonstrated clearly that corre- 
_ lated activity was a primary mechanism 
for segregating inputs. 
The three-eyed frogs would have 
been unremarkable—as well as some- 
| what unattractive—if it were not for the 
_ dramatic change that occurred when 
the third eye innervated one of two 
_ normally singly innervated tecta. In 
a two-eyed frog, each eye exclusively 
_ innervates the optic tectum on the con- 
tralateral side. No partial decussation 
leads to binocular innervation, and the 
input from each eye is distributed in 
one continuous band of axon terminals 
in the retinal-recipient layer of the tec- 
tum. When input from a third eye must 
be accommodated, however, a dramatic 
change occurs. The third eye innervates 
one of the two tecta selectively, and its 
axon terminals become segregated from 
that of the normal eye into periodic 
bands. These bands are of the same 
size and pattern as ocular dominance 
columns in the mammalian visual cor- 
tex. Their boundaries are quite sharp, 
and the dendrites of tectal cells within 
each band tend not to transgress the 
territory innervated by the other band. 
Moreover, the development of this pat- 
tern relies on normal electrical activity 
in both eyes that doubly innervate the 
tectum. The cellular basis of this appar- 
ently activity-dependent segregation is 
mediated by NMDA-dependent mech- 
anisms that are thought generally to 
underlie Hebbian phenomena in which 
correlated activity leads to segregated 
patterns of synaptic input. 
This visual augmentation experiment 
confirms the interpretation of visual 
deprivation experiments in mammals. 
When a correlated, visually driven set of 
inputs is added to another set of similar 
inputs that normally do not segregate, 
the higher degree of correlation of 
activity within each set of inputs (ver- 
sus between the inputs from the two 
independent eyes) leads to a periodic 
segregation of connections. Conversely, 
when one set of inputs is removed 
from a system where there is normal 
innervation by two eyes, the segregated 
pattern is disrupted, and the remaining 
input changes to a continuous, or 
dramatically expanded, pattern of con- 
nectivity driven by the intact eye. Here, 
correlation is indeed causation—the 
correlated activity of two distinct sets 
of visual inputs from two independent 
eyes causes segregation of connectiv- 
ity in the target region. This segrega- 
tion presumably reflects the Hebbian 
mechanisms that are thought to govern 
competitive synapse formation and 
elimination throughout the developing 
(and mature) brain.

innervated exclusively by inputs representing one eye or 
the other could arise. In this scenario, ocular dominance 
column rearrangements in layer 4 are generated by correla- 
tion between inputs carrying similar patterns of activity, and 
by competition between inputs carrying dissimilar patterns. 
Manipulating Competition 
To specifically test the role of correlated activity in driving 
the competitive postnatal rearrangement of cortical con- 
nections, it is necessary to create a situation in which activ- 
ity levels in each eye remain the same but the correlations 
between the two eyes are altered. This circumstance can 
be created in experimental animals by cutting one of the 
extraocular muscles in one eye. This condition, in which the 
two eyes can no longer be aligned, is called strabismus (a 
condition that is also recognized clinically in children; see 
the next section). The major consequence of strabismus is 
that objects in the same location in visual space no longer 
stimulate corresponding points on the two retinas at the 
same time. As a result, differences in the visually evoked 
patterns of activity between the two eyes are far greater 
than normal. Unlike monocular deprivation, however, the 
overall amount of activity in each eye remains roughly the 
same; only the correlation of activity arising from corre- 
sponding retinal points is changed. Accordingly, the ana- 
tomical pattern of ocular dominance columns in layer 4 
of cats in which input from both eyes remains active but 
highly asynchronous is sharper than normal. Apparently, 
the total independence of the two eyes further enhances the

correlations between ipsilateral versus contralateral activ- 
ity. In addition, ocular asynchrony prevents the binocular 
convergence that normally occurs in cells above and below 
layer 4; ocular dominance histograms from such animals 
show that cells in all layers are driven exclusively either by 
one eye or the other (Figure 24.9). Evidently, strabismus 
not only accentuates the competition between the two sets 
of thalamic inputs in layer 4, but also prevents binocular 
interactions in the other layers, which are mediated by local 
connections originating from cells in layer 4. 
Amblyopia, Strabismus, and Critical 
Periods for Human Vision 
Developmental phenomena in the visual systems of experi- 
mental animals accord with clinical problems seen in chil- 
dren who have experienced similar deprivation. The loss of 
acuity, diminished stereopsis, and problems with fusion that 
arise from early deficiencies of visual experience is called 
amblyopia (Greek, "dim sight"). These functional difficul- 
ties are all believed to reflect the essential contribution made 
by normal binocular input and competition for defining, in 
an experience-dependent manner, the cortical circuitry nec- 
essary for binocular vision and depth perception, during the 
critical period for visual cortical development. 
In humans, amblyopia is most often the result of stra- 
bismus. Depending on the extraocular muscles affected, the 
misalignment can produce convergent strabismus, called eso- 
tropia ("crossed eyes"); or divergent strabismus, called exo- 
tropia ("wall eyes"). These alignment errors, both of which 
produce double vision, are surprisingly common, affecting

electrophysiological recordings in (A) normal adult cats 
and (B) adult cats in which strabismus was induced during 
the critical period. The number of binocularly driven cells 
(groups 3, 4, and 5) is sharply decreased as a consequence 
of strabismus; most of the cells are driven exclusively by 
stimulation of one eye or the other. This enhanced segrega- 
tion of the inputs presumably results from the greater dis- 
crepancy in the patterns of activity between the two eyes 
as a result of surgically interfering with normal conjugate 
vision. This pathological state is thought to enhance the rel- 
ative degree of correlation within inputs from each eye and 
decrease the possibility of correlation between eye inputs. 
(After Hubel and Wiesel, 1965.) 
about 5% of children. In some of these individuals, the 
response of the visual system is to suppress input from 
one eye by mechanisms that are not completely un- 
derstood but which are thought to reflect competitive 
interactions during the critical period. Presumably, the 
inputs to the LGN from the properly aligned eye are 
competitively advantaged, and thus the corresponding 
LGN inputs are accorded more territory in the visual cortex. 
Functionally, the suppressed eye eventually comes to have 
very low acuity and may render an individual effectively blind 
in that eye. Early surgical correction of ocular misalignment 
(by adjusting the lengths of extraocular muscles) has become 
an essential treatment for strabismic children. 
Another cause of visual deprivation in humans is cata- 
racts, which can be caused by several congenital condi- 
tions and which render the lens opaque. Diseases such as 
onchocerciasis ("river blindness," the result of infection by 
the parasitic nematode Onchocerca volvulus) and trachoma 
(caused by the parasitic bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis) 
affect millions of people in tropical regions, often inducing 
corneal opacity in one or both eyes. A cataract in one eye is 
functionally equivalent to monocular deprivation in experi- 
mental animals. Left untreated in children, this defect also 
results in an irreversible effect on the visual acuity of the de- 
prived eye. If either the cataract or corneal opacity is removed 
before about 4 months of age, however, the consequences of 
this monocular deprivation are largely avoided. As expected 
from Hubel and Wiesel's work, bilateral cataracts—which are 
similar to binocular deprivation in experimental animals— 
produce less dramatic deficits even if treatment is delayed. 
Apparently, unequal competition during the critical period 
for normal vision is more deleterious than the complete dis- 
ruption of visual input that occurs with binocular deprivation. 
In keeping with the findings in experimental animals, 
the visual abilities of individuals monocularly deprived of 
vision as adults (for example, by cataracts or corneal scar- 
ring) are much less compromised, even after decades of 
deprivation, when vision is restored (although there may 

552 
CHAPTER 24 
be important psychological consequences of restoring sight 
after prolonged binocular blindness, engagingly described 
by the neurologist Oliver Sacks, among others). Nor is there 
any evidence of anatomical change in this circumstance. 
For instance, a patient whose eye was surgically removed 
in adulthood showed normal ocular dominance columns 
when his brain was examined postmortem many years 
later. Thus, one can detect evidence of critical-period phe- 
nomena for visual cortical development and behavior in the 
visual system of humans based on careful examination of 
patients with ophthalmic disease or other lesions. 
Evidence for Critical Periods in Other 
Sensory Systems 
Although the neural basis of critical periods has been 
most thoroughly studied in the mammalian visual system, 
similar phenomena exist in the auditory, somatic sensory, 
and olfactory systems as well as in motor pathways. Ex- 
periments on the role of auditory experience and neural 
activity in owls (who use auditory information to localize 
prey) indicate that neural circuits for auditory localization, 
like mammalian visual circuits, are shaped by experience 
(Table 24.1). Thus, deafening an owl or altering its neural 
activity during early postnatal development compromises 
the bird's ability to localize sounds and capture prey and 
can alter the neural circuits that mediate these capacities. 
TABLE 24.1 Critical Periods and Molecular Regulators for Some Neural Systems 
The development of song in many bird species provides 
another example of auditory system critical periods as well 
as critical periods for motor control of a complex behav- 
ior (see Box 24B). In the somatic sensory system, there is a 
critical period during which cortical maps can be changed 
by experience. In mice or rats, for instance, the anatomical 
patterns of "whisker barrels" in the somatic sensory cortex 
(see Chapter 9) can be altered by abnormal sensory experi- 
ence (or by removing subsets of sensory receptors such as 
whiskers) during a narrow window in early postnatal life. In 
the olfactory system, behavioral studies (outlined in Chap- 
ter 15) indicate that exposure to maternal odors for a limited 
period can alter the ability to respond to such odorants—a 
change that can persist throughout life. 
Clearly, critical periods are common in the development 
of sensory perception and related motor skills. The primary 
evidence for these critical periods comes from deprivation 
experiments analogous to those done in the visual system, 
complemented by analysis using pharmacological ap- 
proaches or genetically modified animals in which major 
neurotransmitter synthetic pathways are disabled, essen- 
tial neurotransmitter receptors such as NMDA receptors 
are lost, or major signaling molecules (e.g., the calcium/ 
calmodulin kinases, BDNF, the neurotrophin receptors, 
or, in the case of sexually dimorphic song behaviors in 
birds, gonadal steroids such as estrogen and testosterone) 
have been disrupted. In each instance, these molecular

The Development of Language: 
A Critical Period for a Distinctly 
Human Behavior 
The series of experimental and clinical observations in the 
visual system of cats, monkeys, and humans described above 
provides the most complete description of the phenomenon 
of the critical period and its underlying physiological mecha- 
nisms. These studies raise the question of whether critical 
periods can be documented for even more complex behav- 
iors, including cognitive function and, in humans, language. 
While cellular and physiological evidence is not yet avail- 
able, a number of behavioral observations have defined a 
critical period for language acquisition and production. 
Exposure to language from birth onward is essential for 
the development of appropriate capacity to comprehend 
and produce meaningful communication. The various forms 
of early language exposure, including the "baby talk" that 
parents and other adults often use to communicate with 
infants and small children, may actually serve to empha- 
size important perceptual distinctions that facilitate proper 
language production and comprehension. To be effective, 
this linguistic experience must occur in early life. The re- 
quirement for perceiving and practicing language (as op- 
posed to specific auditory, visual, or motor skills) during a 
critical period is apparent in studies of language acquisition 
in congenitally deaf children, whose language acquisition 
(i.e., sign language) relies on seeing and moving the hands 
and fingers (the equivalent of spoken and heard language) 
rather than on listening and moving the lips, tongue, and 
larynx. Whereas most hearing and speaking babies be- 
gin producing speechlike sounds ("babbling") at about 7 
months, congenitally deaf infants show obvious deficits in 
their early vocalizations and fail to develop language if not 
provided with an alternative form of symbolic expression 
such as sign language (see Chapter 27). If, however, deaf 
children are exposed to sign language at an early age (from 
approximately 6 months onward, which is particularly likely 
for the children of deaf, signing parents), they begin to 
"babble" with their hands, just as a hearing infant babbles 
audibly (Figure 24.10). This manual babbling suggests that, 
regardless of the modality, early experience shapes lan- 
guage behavior. Children who have acquired speech but 
lose their hearing before puberty also suffer a substantial 
decline in spoken language, presumably because they are 
unable to hear themselves or others talk and thus lose the 
opportunity to refine their speech by auditory feedback dur- 
ing the final stages of the critical period for language. 
The auditory details of the language an individual hears 
during early life shapes both the perception and production

Manual "babbling" in deaf infants. The 
two infants studied here were raised by deaf, signing parents. 
Babbling was judged by scoring hand positions and shapes that 
showed some resemblance to the components of American Sign 
Language and comparing these scores with those of manual 
babble in three hearing infants. In these deaf infants with sign- 
ing parents, meaningful hand shapes increase as a percentage of 
manual activity between ages 10 and 14 months. Hearing chil- 
dren raised by hearing, speaking parents do not produce similar 
hand shapes. (After Petitto and Marentette, 1991.) 
of speech. Many of the thousands of human languages and 
dialects use appreciably different speech sounds called pho- 
nemes to produce spoken words (examples are the phonemes 
ba and pa in English; see Chapter 27). Very young human 
infants can perceive and discriminate between differences 
in all human speech sounds, and are not innately biased 
towards phonemes characteristic of any particular language. 
However, this universal perceptual capacity does not persist. 
For example, adult Japanese speakers cannot reliably dis- 
tinguish between the r and / sounds in English, presumably 
because this phonemic distinction is not made in Japanese 
and thus is not reinforced by experience during the criti- 
cal period. Nonetheless, 4-month-old Japanese infants can 
make this discrimination as reliably as 4-month-olds raised 
in English-speaking households (as indicated by increased 
suckling frequency or head turning in the presence of a 
novel stimulus). By 6 months of age, however, infants begin 
to show preferences for phonemes in their native language 
over those in foreign languages, much as deaf infants do 
for moving digits that suggest signs. By the end of their first 
year, they no longer respond robustly to phonetic elements 
that are peculiar to non-native languages. This provides ad- 
ditional evidence for the role of experience in shaping lan- 
guage capacity, as well as suggesting a critical period for the 
acquisition of phonetic perception and production. 
The ability to perceive, learn, and produce distinct pho- 
nemes with clarity approximating, if not equaling, those of

Learning language. (A) A critical period for learn-

grammar and vocabulary declines from approximately age 7 onward.

native speakers, as well as the ability to acquire a sense of 
the rules of grammar and usage in a language (see Chap- 
ter 27) persists for several more years, as evidenced by the 
fact that children can usually learn to speak a second lan- 
guage without accent and with fluent grammar until about 
age 7 or 8. After this age, however, performance gradually 
declines no matter what the extent of practice or exposure 
(Figure 24.11A). Changes in the patterns of activity in lan- 
guage regions of the brain in children versus adults suggest 
that the relevant neural circuits may undergo functional or 
structural modifications during the critical period for lan- 
guage (Figure 24.11B). Comparisons of patterns of activity 
in children ages 7-10 with the patterns of adults performing 
the same specific word-processing tasks suggest that differ- 
ent brain regions are activated for the same task in children 
versus adults. While the significance of such differences is 
not clear—they may reflect anatomical plasticity associated 
with critical periods, or distinct modes of performing lan- 
guage tasks in children versus adults—there is nevertheless 
an indication that brain circuits change to accommodate lan- 
guage function during early life, with very different patterns 
of activity seen in adulthood. Thus, although the cellular 
basis is difficult to study, it is likely that activity elicited by 
language experience leads to rearrangement of connectivity, 
analogous to the much better documented changes shaped 
by experience during the critical period in the visual cortex. 
Human Brain Development, 
Activity-Dependent Plasticity, 
and Critical Periods 
The advent of high-resolution, noninvasive imaging tech- 
niques has made it possible to reevaluate some basic aspects 
of human brain development in the context of physiologi- 
cal and behavioral understanding of critical periods and the 
accompanying changes in neuronal growth that have been 
discerned in animal experiments. In the late 1980s, studies in

multiple cortical areas in the rhesus monkey demonstrated 
what had been suggested by less detailed analysis of syn- 
apses in the human visual cortex: The number of synapses 
throughout the cortex (not just in the visual cortex) increased 
during prenatal and a limited period of postnatal life, de- 
clined during a protracted period that included much of 
adolescence, and reached a steady state in early adulthood 
(Figure 24.12). This pattern of an initial increase followed by 
a decline in synapse numbers indicated that critical periods 
may be mediated first by local growth of neural elements 
in an activity-dependent manner, followed by a subsequent 
elimination of some synapses—perhaps the cellular equiva- 
lent of the consequences of Hebbian competition—and the 
selective growth and stabilization of these synapses (see Fig- 
ure 24.1). These quantitative observations suggested a cellu- 
lar basis for activity-dependent plasticity and critical-period 
phenomena throughout the cerebral cortex. 
This suggestion received compelling support from a re- 
markable series of studies begun in the late 1990s and not 
completed until the end of the first decade of the new mil- 
lennium. A group of investigators at the National Institute 
for Mental Health did longitudinal MRI scans of the devel- 
oping brain in 13 children ages 4 through 20 to measure the 
growth of the gray matter (the location of cell bodies, axon 
terminal branches, dendrites, and synapses) throughout the 
cortical mantle. The study's results paralleled those pre- 
dicted from the analyses of rhesus monkeys: Gray matter 
grows throughout the cortex during early life, then declines

over a protracted period of late childhood and early adoles-

distinctions in this overall trajectory of early growth fol- 
lowed by protracted loss of gray matter volume. Primary 
sensory cortices appear to have more robust early growth; 
and decline is more prolonged in higher order association 
cortices, including prefrontal, temporal, and parietal re-

nally. In these studies, males and females were analyzed 
separately (Figure 24.13B). Although the absolute size of 
the brain is distinct in the two sexes, the overall trajectory 
of gray matter volume growth and decline is parallel. This 
process is specific to the gray matter, since white matter 
has a continual increase in both sexes during the same time 
period of postnatal life. 
The elaboration followed by selective elimination of 
connections in the cerebral cortex—inferred from the in- 
crease, then decrease in gray matter volumes—may indeed 
underlie the remarkable capacity of the human brain to 
acquire and refine behavioral capacity from birth through 
early adulthood. The cessation of this process is intrigu- 
ingly coincident with the time in life when the process of 
learning new information and skills becomes increasingly 
difficult. Moreover, this prolonged process of experience- 
driven construction of cortical circuits seems to be altered in 
several disorders in which the development of cortical con- 
nections is thought to be the primary target for pathological 
change including autism, schizophrenia, and attention defi- 
cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In children with ADHD, 
the rate of cortical growth during early postnatal life is de- 
layed and the overall magnitude of growth is diminished 
compared with that of typically developing children (Figure 
24.14A). These deficits in gray matter growth are greatest in 
association cortical areas that mediate cognitive, emotional, 
and social behaviors. Not only is growth diminished and

slowed; decline in volume is enhanced. Thus, in children 
with ADHD, gray matter volume declines more dramati- 
cally, resulting in smaller cortical gray matter volumes in 
adulthood (Figure 24.14B). 
These observations of postnatal brain development in 
living human subjects allow one to infer (but do not prove) 
that experience- and activity-dependent mechanisms dur- 
ing critical periods are primarily responsible for much of 
what we recognize as normal behavioral development, so- 
cial development, and learning. This implies that the final 
target (although not necessarily the initial cause) of several 
behavioral and psychiatric disorders may include the activ- 
ity- and experience-dependent processes that shape and— 
under normal circumstances—optimize those connections 
that mediate complex behaviors. 
Summary 
An individual animal's history of interaction with its envi- 
ronment—its "experience"—helps shape its neural circuitry 
and thus determines subsequent behavior. Experience dur- 
ing specific times in early life, referred to as critical periods, 
helps shape behaviors as diverse as maternal bonding and 
the acquisition of language. Correlated patterns of activ- 
ity are thought mediate critical periods by stabilizing con- 
currently active synaptic connections and weakening or

eliminating connections whose activity is divergent. The 
cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in critical 
periods rely on the activity of several neurotransmitters, 
receptors, and intracellular signaling cascades that modify 
gene expression in response to changes in synaptic activ- 
ity in a target cell. Genes for neurotrophins such as BDNF, 
extracellular matrix components, and neurotransmitter re- 
ceptors are all targets for altered expression in response to 
synaptic activity during critical periods. The most accessible 
and thoroughly studied example of a critical period is that 
responsible for the establishment of normal vision. These 
studies show that experience is translated into patterns of 
neuronal activity that influence the function and connectiv- 
ity of neurons in the visual cortex. When normal patterns 
of activity are disturbed during the critical period in early 
life (experimentally in animals or by pathology in humans), 
connectivity in the visual cortex is altered, as is visual func- 
tion. If not reversed before the end of the critical period, 
these structural and functional alterations of brain circuitry 
are difficult or impossible to change. Observations of the 
addition and elimination of synapses throughout the cere- 
bral cortex in animals, and parallel analysis of the increase 
and decrease of cortical gray matter volumes in children 
and adolescents, indicate that a full range of human behav- 
iors—including those compromised in conditions such as 
autism, schizophrenia, and ADHD—may be shaped by ac- 
tivity and experience-dependent addition and subsequent 
elimination of synaptic connections during critical periods 
that begin at birth and end in early adulthood.

REPAIR AND 
Overview 
THE ABILITY OF BRAIN TISSUE TO ALTER, RENEW, OR REPAIR itself (beyond 
the molecular or cellular changes associated with synaptic plasticity) is limited. Unlike 
many other organs—notably the skin, lungs, intestine, and liver—that continuously 
generate new cells, human brains do not produce large numbers of new neurons 
once the initial complement is established (from mid-gestation through early post- 
natal life). Nevertheless, some nervous system repair does occur after injury. In the 
periphery, axons can regrow through vacated peripheral nerve sheaths and eventu- 
ally reinnervate sensory specializations in the skin or synaptic sites on muscles. In 
contrast, the modest recovery seen after brain injury is usually attributed to reorgani- 
zation of function using remaining, intact circuits rather than repair of damaged brain 
tissue. In the brain, few existing neurons can grow a new axon if the original axon is 
severed or injured, nor can neurons replace dendrites lost due to local tissue damage 
or degenerative disease. Three barriers restrain central nervous system regenera- 
tion. First, the consequences of local injury to brain tissue often lead to neuronal 
death. Second, several other cell classes, particularly glial cells, actively inhibit axon 
growth. Third, although neural stem cells are retained in the adult brain, most are 
constrained in their ability to divide, migrate, and differentiate. There are a few ex- 
amples, however, where these impediments are circumvented. Efforts to understand 
these exceptions provide a foundation for ongoing research into potential therapies 
for brain repair following traumatic injury or degeneration due to pathologies such 
as Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's diseases. 
The Damaged Brain 
Many organs are capable of a great deal of repair and regeneration. The epithelial cells 
of the epidermis and intestinal lining are constantly lost and replaced, as are blood 
cells. Broken bones knit and wounds heal. Transplant surgeries have demonstrated 
that the adult liver has previously unsuspected regenerative abilities. However, the 
brain, especially in mammals, is generally refractory to repair. This deficiency was 
noted clinically at the dawn of medical history in ancient Egypt (Figure 25.1), and the 
REGENERATION IN 
THE Nervous SysTEM 

560 
CHAPTER 25 
understanding of the structure and function of nervous tis- 
sue gained in the intervening two millennia has reinforced 
a sense of hopelessness. The realization that nervous tissue 
is made up of many classes of highly branched, intercon- 
nected nerve cells that communicate via electrical impulses 
made it clear that repairing nervous tissue presents a far 
ereater challenge than regenerating the liver. Moreover, as 
postmortem analyses and histological studies progressed, it 
became clear that specifically localized lesions accompany 
the behavioral deficits seen after brain damage, and that 
these lesions remain visible even many years after the in- 
jury. In such patients, there appears to be little repair of 
damaged tissue; the injured region is characterized either 
by a fluid-filled cyst or by "scar tissue" that lacks the histo- 
logical integrity of neighboring intact brain regions. Thus, 
adaptive changes in brain function following injury are un- 
likely to reflect wholesale replacement or remodeling of the 
cellular constituents of the brain. 
Although still widely held, the view that the brain, once 
damaged, could never be restored to its previous state has 
been challenged over the past century and continues to be 
vigorously debated. Modern studies of functional recovery 
after brain injury support the notion that some improve- 
ment seen in patients following neural trauma reflects the 
reorganization of intact circuits rather than the regrowth 
or replacement of damaged neurons. Nevertheless, prom- 
ising evidence for the possibility of brain repair has come 
from a better understanding of the developmental mecha- 
nisms used to construct neural tissue in the first place. 
FIGURE 25.1 
An ancient Egyptian papyrus acknowledges 
the difficulty of repairing the brain and spinal cord. The 
symbols in brown translate to: When you examine a man with a 
dislocation of a vertebra of his neck, and you find him unable to 
move his arms, and his legs... Then you have to say: a disease one 
cannot treat. (From Case and Tessier-Lavigne, 2005.) 
Functional Reorganization 
without Repair 
Neurologists have long recognized that, over time, patients 
who suffer localized strokes or sustain injuries to distinct 
brain regions often recover some of the deficits seen im- 
mediately after the trauma. Movement in paralyzed limbs 
can improve (especially if physical therapy is included in 
the treatment plan), and communication impairments may 
diminish with intensive speech therapy. Such recovery is 
not thought to reflect regrowth or replacement of damaged 
neurons. Instead, the available evidence indicates undam- 
aged brain regions eventually become reorganized to sup- 
port, at least in part, functions whose primary representa- 
tion was disrupted. The best understanding of functional 
recovery comes from studies of the primary motor cortex. 
Motor deficits are lateralized and localized to distinct body 
parts and therefore can be studied precisely. Recovery, in 
terms of force generation and accuracy of movement, can 
be measured reliably over time. Finally, cognition and com- 
munication is often intact in patients with primary motor 
cortex lesions, making characterization of deficits as well as 
rehabilitation easier. 
We know from observations made in animals that cir- 
cuits in the adult primary motor cortex retain some capac- 
ity for use-dependent plasticity, suggesting a biological 
mechanism for reorganization and recovery. The plastic- 
ity of the primary motor cortex reflects that region's rich 
array of horizontally spreading axonal connections: at any 
point in the cortex, there is functional access to other spa- 
tial locations in the motor map. Connections that might 
not be maximally active when the system is intact can be 
"unmasked" when there is damage elsewhere. Indeed, if 
as few as one-fifth of the neurons contributing to the rep- 
resentation of a distinct movement are left intact, fairly 
complete functional recovery can occur. This recovery may 
be due to altered GABAergic inhibition regulated by some 
horizontal connections. In addition, plastic changes that fa- 
vor functional recovery—similar to long-term potentiation 
(LTP) or long-term depression (LTD; see Chapter 8)—are 
made at individual synapses between intact excitatory or 
inhibitory neurons. There may be some local sprouting of 
axon branches or dendrites from intact neurons to further 
strengthen remaining connections. Finally, there may be 
altered activity in the ipsilateral motor cortex (if it is intact). 
The presumed consequences of motor cortex plasticity 
can be seen in stroke patients using functional MRI of the 
motor cortex in parallel with observing the patient's prog- 
ress through rehabilitation therapies. This imaging provides 
a record of the overall metabolic activity of cortical regions 
left intact after brain damage, although it does not directly 
measure synaptic activity. The most thorough studies have

Altered cortical activity patterns are cor- 
related with functional recovery after a focal stroke. (A) 
Functional MRI map of diminished activity compared with age- 
matched control subjects following a middle cerebral artery 
(MCA) stroke. Regions of maximally diminished activity are red; 
orange and yellow reflect moderate changes. The data reflect 
the average of changes from six patients with comparable MCA 
strokes projected onto an idealized brain surface. There is a 
statistically significant bilateral decline in activity in much of the 
precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex; blue arrows); the decline 
is slightly enhanced (red) contralateral to the lesion. There is 
also decline in activity in supplementary motor areas (asterisks). 
Finally, visual cortex activity is diminished. (B) Improvement of 
been of patients with focal strokes in the subcortical white 
matter. In these persons, the amount of cortical activity, 
particularly in the hand region of the motor map, declines 
with improved function (Figure 25.2A). Indeed, those with 
poorer outcomes did not show as extensive a decline in ec- 
topic cortical activation. This surprising finding can be best 
appreciated by following differences in cortical activity in a 
single patient over time (Figure 25.2B,C). As hand move- 
ment improved in a patient with focal pontine stroke (com- 
promising axons from upper motor neurons in the hand 
representation), focal activity in the hand representation in 
the primary motor cortex declined. Activity in supplemen- 
tary motor cortex, as well as the primary and secondary vi- 
sual cortices both ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion, 
also diminished (see Figure 25.2B). 
Similar observations have been made in patients with 
focal strokes that compromise complex functions such as

is seen as an increased "recovery score," which measures perfor- 
mance on a battery of tasks that require hand-grasping and con- 
trolled movement. (C) Areas of diminished (red) and increased

primary motor cortex. This composite image shows bilateral 
diminished activity in the primary and supplementary motor 
areas, as well as in the visual cortex. (From Ward et al., 2003a,b.) 
language. Activation of remaining brain circuits changes 
over time following rehabilitation and functional recovery; 
however, the direction and localization of these changes is 
more variable than changes that occur in the motor cortex. 
Thus, neural circuits that remain following focal brain dam- 
age can reorganize, based on changing patterns of activa- 
tion, to accommodate functional recovery, even if rules for 
reorganization remain elusive. The limited nature of this 
reorganization and its absence in patients with more pro- 
found impairments indicate the difficulty of regaining nor- 
mal function after the brain has been damaged. 
Three Types of Neuronal Repair 
The possibilities and limits of neuronal regeneration in a 
damaged brain (rather than functional reorganization of in- 
tact neurons) rest on three types of repair. The first type is the 

562 
CHAPTER 25 
regrowth of axons, either from nerve cells in peripheral gan- 
elia or from central nerve cells whose peripherally projecting 
axons are severed (Figure 25.3A). This scenario requires a 
reactivation of the developmental processes for axon growth 
and guidance, as well as those for initial synapse formation. 
In addition, such repair may require activity-dependent com- 
petitive mechanisms to insure proper quantitative matching

of newly regrown afferents to temporarily denervated tar- 
gets. This first type of repair is seen primarily when sensory 
or motor nerves are damaged in the periphery, leaving the 
nerve cell bodies in the relevant sensory and autonomic gan- 
glia or the spinal cord intact. This peripheral nerve regeneration 
is the most easily accomplished type of repair in the nervous 
system, and the most clinically successful. 
FIGURE 25.3 
Three types of nervous system repair or regeneration. (A) In periph- 
eral nerve regeneration, when peripheral axons are severed, the neuron, whether in a 
peripheral ganglion or in the central nervous system, regenerates the distal portion of the 
axon. (B) Repair of existing neurons at and around a site of injury in the central nervous 
system. Prior to injury, glial cells (dark green) are quiescent. Immediately following the 
injury, the glial cells grow, axons and dendrites degenerate, and connections are lost. 
Following recovery, some modest axon and dendrite growth may be seen, but the hyper- 
trophic glial cells remain to form a "scar" at the site of the tissue damage. (C) Neuronal 
replacement depends on the maintenance of a neural stem cell (dark purple). Following 
injury, this stem cell proliferates and gives rise to new neuroblasts that then differentiate 
and integrate into the damaged tissue. These new neurons (dark purple) make connec- 
tions with existing cells.

Post-recovery 

The second type of repair is restoration of damaged central 
nerve cells that, although injured, nevertheless survive (Fig- 
ure 25.3B). This response requires first that nerve cells be 
capable of restoring their damaged processes and connec- 
tions to some level of functional integrity. Thus, new den- 
drites, axons, and synapses must grow from an existing cell 
body. To achieve this, several developmental mechanisms 
must be re-engaged, including appropriate regulation of 
cell polarity to distinguish dendrites and axons; adhesion 
signals to direct process extension; and trophic signaling 
to support growth (see Chapter 22). This type of repair re- 
quires the cooperative regrowth of existing neuronal and 
glial elements in a more complex environment than that of 
the peripheral nervous system. It fails in the injured cen- 
tral nervous system, however, most likely because of local 
overgrowth of glial cells and their production of signals that 
inhibit neuron growth. One possible reason for glial over- 
growth is the delicate balance of immune system-mediated 
clearance of damaged tissue. Damage to brain tissue elic- 
its a local inflammatory response that supports glial rather 
than neuronal growth. The subsequent loss of trophic sup- 
port to damaged axons and dendrites (due to inaccessibil- 
ity of targets obscured by glial overgrowth) along with the 
action of inflammatory cytokines (released by macrophages 
and other immune cells in response to tissue damage) may 
suppress reactivation of cellular mechanisms for dendritic 
and axonal regrowth as well as those for synapse formation. 
The third type of repair is the wholesale genesis of new 
neurons to replace those that have been lost, whether 
through normal wear and tear or as a result of traumatic 
damage (Figure 25.3C). Such adult neuronal genesis occurs 
rarely, and its mechanisms are controversial. The genesis 
of peripheral olfactory receptor neurons (see Chapter 15) 
is an example of this type of ongoing repair; the growth 
of newly generated axons from these new olfactory recep- 
tor neurons resembles other instances of peripheral nerve 
regeneration. For such repair to occur, several criteria must 
be met. First, nervous tissue must retain a population of 
multipotent neural stem cells (see Box 22A) able to give rise 
to all of the cell types of the brain region that has been 
damaged. Second, these neural stem cells must be present 
in a distinct region—a "niche"—that retains an appropri- 
ate environment for the genesis and differentiation of new 
nerve cells and glia. Third, the regenerating tissue must 
preserve the capacity to recapitulate the migration, process 
outgrowth, and synapse formation necessary to reconstitute 
local functional networks of connections as well as long- 
distance connections. 
The remainder of this chapter considers each of these 
three types of brain repair and regeneration. For the most 
part, the extent of repair possible in the mammalian brain 
appears quite limited. Some other vertebrate species 
(and many more invertebrate species) exhibit the capac- 
ity for axon regrowth, neuron replacement, and tissue

regeneration. These examples in insects and other animals 
suggest to some that a better understanding of cellular and 
molecular biology could lead to treatments that promote 
the repair of damaged neural tissue in mammals, includ- 
ing humans. 
Peripheral Nerve Regeneration 
In the early 1900s, the British neurologist Henry Head 
provided a particularly dramatic account of repair in the 
peripheral nervous system. By this time it had become 
clear that damage to a peripheral nerve resulted in a 
gradual but usually incomplete restoration of sensory and 
motor function. The speed and precision of this recovery 
could be facilitated by the surgical reapposition of the two 
ends of the severed nerve. Apparently, if regeneration oc- 
curred in an environment that restored continuity of the 
existing nerve sheath, functional recovery would be far 
greater. Head's interest in this possibility culminated in 
a somewhat idiosyncratic approach to documenting the 
extent of regeneration of damaged peripheral sensory and 
motor nerves. Rather than continue evaluating recovery in 
" patients with traumatic injuries that were variable in loca- 
tion and extent of tissue damage, he performed a precise 
nerve transection and reapposition experiment on himself, 
documenting the results as a personal narrative. In his 
1905 paper, Head wrote: 
On April 25, 1903, the radial (ramus cutaneus radialis) 
and external cutaneous nerves were divided (cut) in the 
neighborhood of my elbow, and after small portions had 
been excised, the ends were united with silk sutures. 
Before the operation the sensory condition of the arm 
and back of the hand had been minutely examined and 
the distances at which two points of the compass could 
be discriminated had been everywhere measured. 
Head, Rivers, and Sherren, 1905, Brain 28: 99-115 
Head went on to monitor the return of sensation and move- 
ment to the parts of his hand that had been rendered insen- 
sitive and paralyzed by the lesion (Figure 25.4). His obser- 
vations emphasized several important aspects of peripheral 
nerve regeneration in this one-of-a-kind experiment. The 
first indication of recovery was a difference in the return of 
general sensitivity to pressure and touch that was not well 
localized (a sensitivity he called "protopathic"), beginning 
at approximately 6 weeks and lasting about 13 weeks. Head 
thus concluded that "the protopathic system regenerates 
more rapidly and with greater ease. It can triumph over 
want of apposition and the many disadvantages that are 
liable to follow traumatic division of a nerve." 
Head also experienced a set of sensations that recovered 
more slowly and with less restoration to his recollection of 
his original sensory state. These phenomena included sen- 
sitivity to light touch, temperature discrimination, pinprick,

and two-point discrimination, as well as fine motor control 
(which he referred to as "epicritic" abilities). In fact, these 
faculties were not fully recovered over the 2 years between 
Head's surgical injury and the paper he wrote. He wrote 
"the fibers of this system are more easily injured, and re- 
generate more slowly, than those of the protopathic system. 
They are evidently more highly developed and approach 
more nearly to the motor fibres that supply voluntary mus- 
cle in the time required for their regeneration." 
These remarkable observations were the first to distin- 
guish between the recuperative abilities of various classes of 
dorsal root ganglion cells and spinal motor neurons during 
the process of peripheral reinnervation. The distinction is 
presumably related to the initial specificity between differ- 
ent classes of dorsal root ganglion cell and motor axons 
and their targets during development—a specificity that 
relies on a variety of molecular signals, including several 
different neurotrophins (see Figure 23.17). The importance 
of this spectrum of cues in regeneration is reviewed in the 
following section.

prick), and the dotted line shows regions 
that were insensitive to light touch, (e.g., 
a wisp of cotton). The lower panel shows 
the region of Head's hand and thumb that 
regained sensation after an initial period of 
recovery (2-6 months). The various marks 
within the re-sensitized region indicate "hot" 
and "cold" spots that were more or less sensi- 
tive to stimulation (B from Head, Rivers, and 
Sherren, 1905.) 
The Cellular and Molecular Basis of 
Peripheral Nerve Repair 
The cellular basis of peripheral nerve regeneration provides 
perhaps the clearest example of the relationship between 
the mechanisms that repair neural damage and those used 
to promote initial axon growth and synapse formation dur- 
ing development. Even though the molecular mechanisms 
are similar, the environment for adult peripheral nerve re- 
pair is far different than that in the embryo (Figure 25.5A). 
The major cellular elements that contribute to peripheral 
axon regrowth and the reinnervation of targets are Schwann 
cells, the glial cells that myelinate peripheral axons; and 
macrophages, immune system cells that clear the degener- 
ating remains Of severed axons (Figure 25.5B). In addition to 
their respective roles in supporting intact axons and remov- 
ing debris, both of these adult cell types secrete molecules 
that are essential for successful regeneration. In this pro- 
cess, the Schwann cell plays a dominant role in insuring the 
appropriate cellular and molecular milieu for regeneration 
following injury. 
When a peripheral axon is severed, the axon segment 
distal to the site of the cut degenerates; when the axon is 
crushed, however, more rapid recovery occurs because the 
damaged distal segments provide a helpful guide to the 
regenerating proximal axons (Figure 25.5C). Completely 
severed axons degenerate and their remains are cleared by 
macrophages. Thus, only Schwann cells in the distal stump 
of the nerve and the basal lamina components secreted by

cells. (B) Degeneration and regeneration in an idealized single peripheral nerve "tube" 
of perineurium/basal lamina. Once the axon is cut, the distal portion degenerates and 
is phagocytosed by macrophages. After the debris is mostly cleared, the proximal axon 
stump transforms into a growth cone, and this growth cone interacts with the adja- 
cent Schwann cells. The image next to the drawing shows this step in peripheral nerve 
regeneration imaged in a living mouse after peripheral nerve damage. The nascent 
growth cones can be seen at the site of the cut, and in a few cases growing beyond it 
into the distal stump. Finally, the axon has regrown past the site of the cut, which is now 
repaired. (C) Regeneration is more efficient after crushing versus cutting a nerve. This 
panel shows a nerve adjacent to that which was cut in the same animal shown in (B). The 
remaining axons have recovered far more rapidly, and there is extensive regeneration 
across the site of the crush. (D) Activity and use can influence peripheral axon regrowth. 
The fibular nerve in the leg of a mouse was transected and a significant length of nerve 
removed. Subsets of axons are labeled using a fluorescent reporter transgene as in panel 
(C). A heterologous graft of peripheral nerve from a donor mouse was positioned as a 
ste 
"bridge" (between the arrows in each nerve shown). After the graft was complete, over 
200 mm 
the course of two additional weeks, the mice were either left to recover while pursu- 
ing their normal cage activities (left) or given a regime of exercise on a treadmill (right). 
Exercised mice showed significantly more nerve growth through the graft and recovered 
function more rapidly. (B,C photos from Pan et al., 2003; D from Sabatier et al. 2009.)

position of distal and proximal nerve segments facilitates 
precise regeneration and better recovery of function, espe- 
the Schwann cell are available to stimulate and guide re- 
generation (see Figures 25.5C and Figure 25.6). The extra- 
cellular matrix, within the spaces defined by Schwann cell 
processes, provides a conduit of sorts for the regenerating 
axons. These remaining components in the distal peripheral 
nerve, referred to as bands of Bungner, are composed of 
a relatively orderly array of Schwann cells, matrix compo- 
nents, immune cells, and connective tissue. The extracellu- 
lar matrix associated with axon fascicles (also referred to as 
the basal lamina, although a peripheral nerve is not really 
an epithelium) in the nerve before damage is more or less 
cially of fine touch and movement (Henry Head's "epicritic" 
abilities; see above). Indeed, this sort of surgical reapposi- 
tion, now done using microscopic guidance, remains the 
primary therapeutic approach to peripheral nerve injury. 
The regenerating axons express integrins (see Figure 
23.4A) that mediate recognition of the matrix; subsequent 
intracellular signaling facilitates growth. If an injury is so 
extensive that much of the nerve is lost, new Schwann cells 
can be generated by Schwann cell precursors remaining in 
the damaged proximal nerves. These new cells can then pro- 
vide an appropriate environment to support the extension 

566 
CHAPTER 25 
of a newly generated growth cone from the axon stump. 
Nevertheless, the absence of a nearby distal stump makes 
regeneration limited and imprecise and dramatically dimin- 
ishes the recovery of function. 
In some cases, nerve damage is so extensive that the 
proximal and distal nerves cannot be directly rejoined, and 
reasonable recovery cannot be achieved without additional 
surgical intervention. In such cases, surgeons attach both 
proximal and distal ends to a nearby intact nerve in the 
hope that growth will occur via the existing healthy nerve. 
The other option is to take a length of nerve from a do- 
nor (this is primarily done in experimental animals) and 
attach the proximal and distal ends to this heterologous 
graft (Figure 25.5D, left). Additional approaches include 
development of biomaterials that can substitute for the 
lost length of peripheral nerve and serve as a scaffold for 
the migration and differentiation of Schwann cells from 
the proximal nerve stump to provide a replacement nerve 
sheath. The success of such interventions relies on control 
of mechanical forces around the injured nerve after surgical 
repair, minimizing inflammation and infection, and, even- 
tually, moderate increased activity or training of the injured 
muscles that are innervated by the nerve. Thus, modest ex- 
ercise training in injured animals whose peripheral nerves 
have been repaired by nerve grafts significantly improves 
the extent of nerve growth (Figure 25.5D, right). 
The Schwann cell is the essential mediator of periph- 
eral axon regrowth through any conduit, under any cir- 
cumstances. Schwann cells provide molecular support 
that facilitates regeneration by recreating a molecular 
Proximal to injury 
environment similar to the milieu that supports axon guid- 
ance and growth during early development (Figure 25.6). 
Schwann cells secrete extracellular matrix molecules such 
as laminin, fibronectin, and collagens that provide a sub- 
strate for growth cone extension. In response to axon injury, 
Schwann cells increase the amount of cell surface adhesion 
molecules such as 
N-CAM, LI, and N-cadherin on their 
surfaces, and regenerating axons express complementary 
cell surface adhesion molecules. Schwann cells near the site 
of injury in the distal end of the nerve increase expression 
and secretion of a number of neurotrophins such as BDNF 
(thought to be especially crucial for motor axon growth). 
Trk and P75 neurotrophin receptors are elevated following 
injury on the newly generated growth cones of regenerat- 
ing peripheral axons. It is likely that this local availability of 
neurotrophins acts to promote a "growth" state (i.e., trophic 
effects) for the damaged axons as well as defining a local 
target distal to the site of damage that directs axon growth 
(i.e., tropic effects). 
FIGURE 25.6 
Molecular and cellular responses that pro- 
mote peripheral nerve regeneration. The Schwann cell is 
essential for this process. Once the macrophages have cleared 
the debris from the degenerating peripheral stump, the Schwann 
cells proliferate, express adhesion molecules on their surface, 
and secrete neurotrophins and other growth-promoting signal- 
ing molecules. In parallel, the parent neuron of the regenerating 
axon expresses genes that restore it to a growth state. The gene 
products are often receptors, or signal transduction molecules, 
that allow the cell to respond to the factors provided by the 
Schwann cell.

In response to these environmental changes orchestrated 
by the Schwann cell, the regenerating peripheral neurons 
also change. Regenerating sensory or motor neurons mod- 
ify gene expression and protein trafficking in the cell body 
to accommodate regrowth. The dynamics of the actin and 
microtubule cytoskeleton must be restored to a "growth" 
state so that growth cone navigation and axon extension 
can occur; changes in gene expression enable this, and 
the genes that are switched on include several associated 
with axon growth during development. A good example is 
growth-associated protein-43 (GAP43). GAP43 is normally 
found in growing axons in the embryo but is also seen at 
high levels following axotomy and the initiation of regrowth 
in the periphery as a result of increased gene expression. In 
addition, many of the signaling mechanisms that modulate 
the cytoskeleton and directed axon extension in develop- 
ment must be reactivated to support regeneration. 
Schwann cells and the milieu they create stimulate pe- 
ripheral axon regrowth, so it would seem that the peripheral 
nerve environment might have growth-promoting capacity 
for central nervous system axons as well. This is indeed the 
case. In experimental animals, severed axons in the optic 
nerve (recall that the optic nerve and retina, although physi- 
cally in the periphery, are actually parts of the central ner- 
vous system) or spinal cord can be provided with a periph- 
eral nerve graft that offers the Schwann cell, basal lamina, 
and connective tissue components that normally support 
peripheral nerve regeneration (Figure 25.7A). Central ax- 
ons grow readily through the peripheral nerve graft. Some 
of these axons can even make synapses in the target terri- 
tory to which the distal end of the graft is connected (Figure 
25.7B). Such experiments show that Schwann cells define 
an environment in the peripheral nerve sheath that is par- 
ticularly well adapted to initiate and support the regrowth of 
damaged adult axons, whether they project to the periphery 
or normally remain within the central nervous system. Why

FIGURE 25.7 
Growth-promoting properties of periph-

of damaged axons in the CNS. (A) Severed axons from the 
optic nerve are apposed to a peripheral nerve graft. The axons, 
which would normally not regenerate through the optic nerve 
(recall that the optic nerve, while physically in the periphery, is 
wholly within the central nervous system), now grow through 
~ the peripheral nerve graft to reach the superior colliculus, a nor- 
mal target for retinal ganglion cells. (B) Regenerated axons make 
synapses with targets in the superior colliculus. The dark material 
is an electron-dense, intracellularly transported tracer that identi- 
fies specific synaptic terminals (arrowheads) as emanating from 
a regenerated retinal axon. (A after So and Aguyao, 1985; B from 
Vidal-Sanz et al., 1991.) 
this same set of highly useful events does not normally occur 
in the central nervous system is an essential and challenging 
question that will be considered later in this chapter. 
Regeneration of Peripheral Synapses 
The extension of axons from mature sensory, autonomic, 
or motor neurons is only the first step in peripheral nerve 
regeneration. The next essential event in successful recov- 
ery of function is reinnervation of appropriate target tissues 
and reestablishment of synaptic connections. This process 
must occur for all three classes of peripheral axons (sensory, 
motor, and autonomic); however, it has been most thor- 
oughly characterized at the neuromuscular junction and in 
the peripheral autonomic system (Box 25A). Because of the 
relative ease of identifying and visualizing synaptic sites on 
muscle fibers, the regenerating neuromuscular junction has 
been studied in great detail (Figure 25.8A,B). The ability to 
define major molecular constituents—synaptic extracellular 
matrix, postsynaptic receptors, and related proteins—gives 
insight into the stability of a denervated synaptic site after 
damage, as well as the changes that accompany reinnevera- 
tion (Figure 25.8C).

CHAPTER 25 
_ The peripheral autonomic system 
has been studied in detail for more 
than a century with respect to neural 
regeneration. The accessibility and 
_ regenerative properties of peripheral 
_ axons allow a variety of investigations 
_ to be done with relative ease. Most 
_ of these studies have been done in 
_ 
the mammalian sympathetic system. 
_ Preganglionic sympathetic fibers, like 
_ other peripheral axons, regenerate 
_ when they are severed. Toward the end 
_ of the nineteenth century, the English 
physiologist John Langley, working 
- at Cambridge University, found that 
_ sympathetic end organ responses (e.g., 
_ 
blood vessel constriction, piloerection, 
_ and pupillary dilation) recovered a few 
weeks after cutting the preganglionic 
nerve to the superior cervical ganglion. 
As indicated in Figure A, the normal 
_ innervation of this and other sympa- 
thetic ganglia is selectively organized in 
that preganglionic axons arising from 
different spinal segments innervate 
particular functional classes of cells in 
the ganglion. Langley found that after 
reinnervation the end organ responses 
were organized much as before; thus, 
stimulation of T1 elicited its particular 
constellation of largely nonoverlapping 
end organ effects compared to stimula- 
tion of the preganglionic axons arising 
from T4. 
Modern experiments confirmed 
Langley's observations and showed 
further that the normal pattern of 
innervation observed with intracellular 
recording is indeed reestablished fol- 
lowing regeneration of the pregangli- 
onic axons. Selective reinnervation also 
occurs in parasympathetic ganglia. The 
chick ciliary ganglion has two function- 
ally and anatomically distinct popula- 
tions of ganglion cells: the ciliary cells 
and the choroidal cells. Because these 
ganglion cell types can be separately 
identified and are in turn innervated by 
preganglionic axons with different con- 
duction velocities, one can ask whether 
these two populations are reinnervated 
by the same classes of axons that con- 
tacted them in the first place. As in 
the mammalian sympathetic system, 
BOX 25A Specific Regeneration of Synaptic Connections in Autonomic Ganglia 
appropriate contacts are reestablished 
during reinnervation. 
The accurate reinnervation of dif- 
ferent classes of sympathetic neurons 
is especially remarkable because the 
ganglion cells innervated by a particular 
spinal segment (and that innervate a 
particular target) are distributed more 
or less randomly through the ganglion. 
This arrangement implies that recog-

elements must occur at the level of the 
target cells. One way to explore the 
implication that ganglion cells bear 
some more or less permanent identity 
is to transplant different sympathetic 
chain ganglia from a donor animal to a 
host where the ganglia can be exposed 
to the same segmental set of pregangli- 
onic axons during reinnervation. One 
can then ask whether two different 
ganglia, normally innervated by differ- 
ent sets of axons, are selectively rein- 
nervated by axons arising from different 
spinal segments. 
As seen in Figure B, different sym- 
pathetic chain ganglia (in this case, the 
superior cervical ganglion and the fifth 
thoracic ganglion) are indeed distin- 
guished by the preganglionic axons in 
the host cervical sympathetic trunk. A

Evidence that synaptic connections between mammalian neurons form according to spe- 
cific affinities between different classes of pre- and postsynaptic cells. (A) In the superior 
cervical ganglion, preganglionic neurons located in particular spinal cord segments (11, 
for example) innervate ganglion cells that project to particular peripheral targets (the 
eye, for example). Establishment of these preferential synaptic relationships indicates that 
selective neuronal affinities are a major determinant of neural connectivity. (B) In a trans- 
plantation experiment, guinea pig donor ganglia C8 (superior cervical ganglion; control) 
and T5 (fifth thoracic ganglion) were transplanted into the superior cervical bed of a 
host 
animal. The graph shows the average postsynaptic response of neurons in the transplant- 
ed ganglia to stimulation of different spinal segments. Although there is overlap, the neu- 
rons in transplanted T5 ganglia are clearly reinnervated by a more caudal set of segments 
than are the transplanted C8 neurons. (B after Purves et al., 1981.) 

BOX 25A (continued) 
the fifth thoracic ganglion transplanted 
to that position, on the other hand, is 
reinnervated by an overlapping but cau- 
dally shifted subset of the thoracic spinal 
cord segments that normally contribute 
to the cervical sympathetic trunk. This 
more caudal innervation approximates 
the original segmental innervation of the 
fifth thoracic ganglion. 
, 
These results indicate that ganglion 
cells carry with them a property that

biases the innervation they receive, in 
confirmation of Langley's original con- 
cept of "chemoaffinity" as a basis for the 
selectivity of target cell innervation (see 
Chapter 23).

When skeletal muscle fibers are denervated, the origi- 
nal neuromuscular synaptic sites remain intact for weeks. 
Indeed, even specialized components of the basal lamina 
that mark synaptic sites remain in the absence of the syn- 
apse itself. At these or nearby sites, many secreted signal- 
ing molecules are either increased or decreased in both the 
muscle cells and the Schwann cells near the denervated 
end plate sites. Presumably, the neurotrophins whose 
expression is increased at the denervated neuromuscular 
junction—NGF and BDNF—enhance the tropic and trophic 
signaling necessary to recapitulate target recognition and 
synaptogenesis. Those that are diminished (NT3 and NT4) 
may be more important for the maintenance of established 
synapses. Their decline may insure that denervated synaptic 
sites are not refractory to innervation by a newly arrived 
regenerated axon.

CHAPTER 25 
The clustering of acetylcholine receptors that defines the 
postsynaptic membrane specialization also remains, as does 
the local scaffolding of proteins that retain the acetylcholine 
receptors at the synaptic specialization on the muscle fiber 
(Figure 25.8B,C). The secreted factor neuregulin and its re- 
ceptors, involved in the initiation of receptor clustering (see 
Chapter 23), remain expressed at the denervated synapse. 
In addition, the extracellular matrix components that distin- 
guish the synaptic portion of the muscle basal lamina are 
maintained when mature muscle fibers are denervated. This 
matrix includes specialized forms of laminin (synaptic, or S 
laminin) normally found at the neuromuscular synapse. In 
addition, the proteoglycan agrin is key for initiating or main- 
taining the synaptic site in muscle fiber via stimulation of 
the muscle kinase receptor MUSK. Finally, molecules that 
are normally bound to the matrix (including acetylcholin- 
esterase, the enzyme that degrades ACh at the neuromus- 
cular synapse; see Chapter 6) are maintained at denervated 
sites. It is also likely that the extracellular matrix localizes 
and concentrates the secreted growth factors produced at 
the synapse by specialized perisynaptic Schwann cells upon 
denervation. Accordingly, this highly organized region of 
the basement membrane, in concert with the postsynaptic 
receptor proteins and Schwann cells, defines the site of re- 
innervation. In fact, even if the muscle fiber is eliminated, 
motor axons recognize these specialized sites (maintained 
in "tubes" of basal lamina that normally surround muscle 
fibers) as optimal locations for reinnervation. 
Molecular specificity, however, provides only one part 
of the instructions needed to reestablish synapses after pe- 
ripheral nerve regeneration. Activity-dependent processes 
similar to those that eliminate polyneuronal innervation 
at neuromuscular synaptic sites during development (de- 
scribed in Chapter 24) are also essential for restoring func- 
tion after peripheral nerve damage. There is a fair degree 
of imprecision in the reinnervation of specific targets, as is 
evident in Henry Head's description of the slowness and 
imprecision of his recovery of fine motor and sensory func- 
tion. This result has been confirmed by more recent stud- 
ies in which reinnervation is observed over time in adult 
animals with experimentally damaged peripheral motor 
nerves (see Figure 25.8C). The subsequent regeneration 
can be fairly faithful to the original pattern, or it can be im- 
precise. Imprecision is due not only to inappropriate target 
matching, but to the return of polyneuronal innervation at 
neuromuscular synapses during regeneration and reinner- 
vation and its consequences for muscle control. Much of 
this innervation is eventually eliminated, presumably via 
the same activity-dependent mechanisms that operate dur- 
ing the early postnatal period, when supernumerary axons 
are eliminated from the developing synapse (see Figure 
23.11). If electrical activity is blocked during regeneration, 
either in the muscle fiber or in the afferent nerve, multiple 
innervation of the end plate sites remains. 
Regeneration after Damage 
to the Central Nervous System 
The second type of repair that occurs following damage to 
the adult brain involves the stabilization and regrowth of 
neurons and processes within an injured region of the cen- 
tral nervous system (spinal cord or brain). With the excep- 
tion of spinal cord and brainstem motor neurons, whose 
axons project into the periphery and therefore have access 
to instructions for the relatively successful peripheral regen- 
eration described above, there is very little long-distance 
axon growth or reestablishment of functional connections 
within the central nervous system following injury. The lim- 
ited regrowth of damaged CNS axons, even those whose 
cell bodies remain intact, largely accounts for the relatively 
poor prognosis following brain or spinal cord damage. 
Damage to the central nervous system usually occurs in 
one of three ways. First, the brain or spinal cord can be in- 
jured acutely by external physical trauma (blunt forces to the 
head or body; Box 25B). A second type of damage is caused 
by hypoxia, a lack of oxygen usually created by locally di- 
minished blood flow (ischemia) due to a vascular occlu- 
sion (e.g., stroke; see Box B in the Appendix) or by a global 
deprivation of oxygen (e.g., drowning or cardiac arrest). 
The third type of damage arises from neurodegenerative dis- 
eases such as Alzheimer's. All three sources result in some 
neuronal death, either immediately or over time. In cases 
of physical damage or severe hypoxia, neurons die quite 
rapidly. When the insult is less severe, some neurons can 
survive and some local axonal or dendritic growth occurs, 
but others die (presumably because of the loss of trophic 
support from their target). Because central axons have little 
ability to regenerate, a key to optimal recovery from brain 
injury lies with the complex cellular events that support the 
survival of those neurons that have not been killed outright 
and whose processes remain relatively intact. 
Cellular and Molecular 
Responses to Injury 
There are two major reasons for the differences between 
successful peripheral regeneration and the limited regen- 
eration in the central nervous system. First, damage to brain 
tissue tends to engage the mechanisms that lead to necrotic 
and apoptotic cell death for nearby neurons whose process 
have been severed. Second, the cellular changes at the site 
of injury do not recapitulate developmental signaling that 
supports growth. Instead, a combination of glial growth and 
proliferation along with microglial activity (microglia have 
immune functions that lead to local inflammation) actively 
inhibits growth. Finally, there is an upregulation of growth- 
inhibiting molecules related to the chemorepellent factors 
that influence axon trajectories during development. Again, 
why these inhibitory phenomena occur is a central question

We often use the same words to 
_ describe contests on the battlefield or 
_ playing field. One side "attacks" the 
other, defenses and offenses are "infil- 
_ trated," and in the end, one side might 
be declared to have "killed" the other—a 
horrible reality in war, an enthusias- 
_ tic metaphor in sports. Until recently, 
_ however, it was not known that soldiers 
and athletes could sustain the same 
_ serious brain injuries on the battlefield 
_ and playing field. It appears that con- 
cussive injuries due to explosions and 
_ blunt trauma in a theater of war cause 
brain damage similar to that caused by 
punches and full body hits in the box- 
ing ring, on the hockey rink, or on the 
_ 
football field. Recent efforts both by the 
U.S military and by sports organizations 
acknowledge this dangerous parallel. 
- These efforts have led to a better under- 
standing of the relationship between 
- 
closed head traumatic brain injuries 
(TBI), behavioral changes, and long-term 
pathology that results in mood, memory, 
and cognitive difficulties accompanied by 
degenerative changes in patients' brains. 
Single or repeated high-energy forces 
_ 
delivered to the head cause TBI. Such 
forces (whether from the detonation 
of an explosive device, the concussive 
force of a boxing punch, or a hockey or 
football hit) overwhelm the ability of the 
skull and the fluid-filled cushion created 
by the subarachnoid space to protect the 
brain from shearing forces. These forces 
can cause acute bleeding around the 
meninges or within brain tissue. In addi- 
tion, blast waves, hard blows, and their 
sequelae cause distension of the long 
axons in white matter pathways, sever- 
ing the axon from its parent cell body. 
Such immediate cellular damage may be 
accompanied by long-term neurodegen- 
erative changes, especially in the brains 
of individuals who sustain repeated TBI. 
While tissue damage and degen- 
eration is thought to be the ultimate 
consequence of TBI, many primary 
symptoms are behavioral. Upon impact 
or immediately thereafter, individuals 
sustaining TBI experience loss of con- 
sciousness, followed by loss of memory 
of events before or immediately after the

injury, altered mental state (disorienta- 
tion, confusion), and mild to moderate 
neurological deficits (diminished somatic 
or cranial nerve reflexes). Following 
these immediate symptoms, there may 
be sustained changes in the behavior of 
the individual including altered mood 
(especially depression), cognitive impair- 
ment, impulsivity, and distorted sensory 
perception. Headaches and lethargy are 
often reported, and many TBI patients 
exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD). Of course, for 
soldiers, it is difficult to disentangle the 
direct consequences of a concussive 
force delivered to the head in an instant, 
and the physiological consequences of 
ongoing stress of warfare. 
Even more insidious, however, are 
the potential long-term consequences 
for victims of TBI. Depending on the 
severity and frequency 
of injuries, TBI 
victims may be at risk for recurrent 
headaches, depression, early onset mild 
cognitive impairment, or more severe 
dementia. Indeed, there are anecdotal 
reports of athletes (especially boxers 
and football players) who have had 
such difficulties. John Grimsley, a line- 
backer for the Houston Oilers in the late 
1980s and early 1990s (Figure A), had 
already begun experiencing memory 
loss and irritability before his death at 
age 45 of an accidental gunshot wound. 
Upon post mortem examination, Mr. 
Grimsley's brain was found to have 
numerous depositions of Tau protein 
(Figure B), the primary constituent of 
: 
neurofibrillary tangles that are one of the 
— 
hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease pathol- 
ogy (see Box 31D). In contrast, post 
mortem examination of a 65-year-old 
control individual with no history of TBI 
and no cognitive impairment showed 
no obvious Tau depositions (Figure C). 
Subsequent analysis of a small number 
of athletes with a history of TBI and 
signs of cognitive impairment, altered 
mood, and memory loss has revealed 
similar pathology. The neurological 
and behavioral deficits that follow TBI, 
paired with post mortem degenera- 
tive pathology, are now classified as a

of cell death that occurs after direct damage to the brain.

limited ability of the brain to repair itself 
once damage has occurred.

which the carotid artery was transiently constricted. Nissl stain (see 
Chapter 1) was used to visualize cell bodies. The lighter region (i.e., 
little or no staining) shows the extent of cell damage and loss caused 
by this brief deprivation of oxygen. Cells in the higher magnifica- 
tion image were stained for the neuronal marker Neu-N (red) and 
for activated caspase-3 (yellow), indicative of neurons undergoing 
apoptosis. (B) Model of the primary mechanism for neuronal apopto- 
sis after injury. Apoptosis can be elicited by excitotoxicity via excess 
glutamate, or by the binding of inflammatory cytokines to receptors 
in the neuronal membrane. In addition, loss of neuronal connections 
to a target and resultant deprivation of trophic support can initiate 
apoptosis. Any or all of these stimuli result in the removal of the 
anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. Cytochrome c is then released from mito- 
chondria, activating caspase-3 and obligating the cell to apoptotic 
death as caspase-3 stimulates destructive changes in downstream 
molecules. (A from Back et al., 2002.)

In such cases, there is a clear loss of cells in the hypoxic 
region (Figure 25.9A). Where such cell loss has occurred, 
there is also enhanced activation of caspase-3, an enzyme 
that, when activated, obligates a cell to die via apoptosis 
(Figure 25.9B). This genetically regulated mechanism can

be elicited by growth factor deprivation, by hypoxia, or by 
DNA damage and other cellular stress. The transection of 
axons presumably can lead to growth factor deprivation by 
removing the target source for the parent neurons. DNA 
damage and cellular stress (including changes in oxidative 
metabolism and damage from oxygen free radicals)—es- 
tablished triggers for apoptosis—have been suggested to 
underlie some neurodegenerative diseases. 
A major source of cellular stress is glutamatergic over- 
stimulation caused by bursts of abnormal activity arising 
after local brain damage. Such overstimulation can also 
arise from epileptogenic foci and the seizure activity gen- 
erated at these sites. This elevated activity and its conse- 
quences are referred to as excitotoxicity and, if unchecked, 
can lead to neuron death (see Box 6C). Following injury or 
seizure, large amounts of neurotransmitters are released.

This enhanced signaling modifies the effectiveness of 
members of the Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic molecules, 
which normally oppose changes in mitochondrial function 
that reflect oxidative stress. Diminished Bcl-2 activity al- 
lows cytochrome c to be liberated from mitochondria into 
the cytoplasm, where it facilitates activation of caspase-3. 
Activated caspase-3 can then cause the fragmentation of 
nuclear DNA, membrane and cytoskeletal changes, and ul- 
timately cell death (see Figure 25.9B). Thus, one of the key 
determinants of the long-term effects of damage to adult 
neural tissue is the extent to which the damage activates 
apoptosis either directly due to immediate cellular dam- 
age, or due to excitoxicity following excess neurotransmitter 
release in response to brain injury. 
As might be expected from cellular mechanisms of pe- 
ripheral nerve injury, glial cells found at the site of injury 
contribute to the degenerative and regenerative processes 
that occur after brain damage; however, central glia differ 
from Schwann cells in their response to injury. Brain injury 
elicits responses from all three glial classes—astrocytes, oli- 
godendroglia, and microglia—that actively oppose neuronal 
_tegrowth (Figure 25.10). Such cells, referred to as activated 
glia, seem less susceptible to the stimuli that result in neu- 
ronal apoptosis after injury. Thus, local growth and change 
among glial cells is preserved while neighboring neurons 
die. Most brain lesions cause local proliferation of other- 
wise quiescent glial precursors, as well as extensive growth 
of processes from existing glial cells within or around the 
site of injury. These reactions lead to glial scarring (Figure 
25.11A) accompanied by increased secretion of a number of 
signals from activated astrocytes, oligodendroglial cells, and 
microglia. These signals include transforming growth factor 
(TGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), tissue necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF-a), interleukins, interferon-y, and insulin-like 
growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (Figure 25.11B). Depending on the 
cellular target (neuron or glial cell), these signals (some of 
which are cytokines, most of which serve signaling roles 
in the immune system) can either promote cell death and 
phagocytosis (see Figure 25.9) or provide protective signals 
for remaining nerve cells. Depending on the type of injury 
and the time elapsed since its occurrence, local glia either 
alter the relationships among the remaining nerve cells, or 
they become the dominant cell type in the damaged region 
by replacing lost neurons and degenerated processes—te- 
sulting in the long-term glial scar.

CHAPTER 25 
Axon Growth after Brain Injury 
One unfortunate consequence of glial scarring is an 
impediment to axon growth beyond the site of the le- 
sion. The reasons for this barrier action (beyond the

obvious physical interference) are not well understood, 
but it is clear that astroctyes within the glial scar pro- 
duce several molecules that inhibit axon growth. These 
include semaphorin 3A, several ephrins, and Slit (see 
Figures 23.4 and 23.5). The receptors for each of these

membrane protein NogoA. Lingo! and PirB/LILRB2 are receptors 
for the myelin-associated proteins MAG (myelin-associated glyco- 
protein) and OMgp (oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein). TNFRs 
bind the inflammatory cytokine TNF-a. Integrins bind a number of 
extracellular matrix proteins, and two classes of cytokine receptors 
bind pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines released by astrocytes, 
oligodendroglia, or macrophages at sites of injury. (B after Kolodkin 
and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011.) 

molecules are upregulated on the growth cones of axons 
that approach the glial scar, resulting in local distortions 
of the axon. In addition, matrix components that inhibit 
axon growth (particularly tenascin and chondroitin sul- 
fate proteoglycan) are enriched in the extracellular spaces 
within the glial scar. Thus, the proliferation and hyper- 
trophy of glial cells, and their expression of chemorepel- 
lent or growth-inhibiting molecules, dominates the tis- 
sue reaction to focal brain injury (Figure 25.11; see also 
Figure 25.10A). There is considerable speculation about 
why the CNS response to injury inhibits regeneration—for 
example, the mature brain may place a premium on stable 
circuits and thus does not easily accommodate wholesale 
growth and change. There is no easy way, however, to 
confirm or refute such hypotheses. 
Several additional inhibitory molecules prevent axon 
growth in the CNS, most of which are related to brain my- 
elin. Most of these molecules are produced by central oli- 
godendrocytes (which are included in glial scars). Several 
observations suggest that brain myelin, which is produced 
by oligodendroglia, inhibits axon growth, including the di- 
minished ability of axons to grow on substrates enriched 
in myelin-associated proteins such as myelin-associated 
glycoprotein (MAG; see Figure 25.11B). This is something 
of a puzzle, since MAG is also produced by Schwann cells, 
but does not appear to be an impediment for peripheral 
regeneration. 
The most unusual factor, however, is a molecule known 
as NogoA. NogoA is selectively expressed in oligodendrog- 
lial cells; it is not found in Schwann cells. In the early 1990s, 
Martin Schwab and his colleagues raised a polyclonal anti- 
serum to proteins isolated from glial scars and found that this 
antiserum, when applied locally to a damaged area, could 
promote axon growth through the glial scar; this antiserum 
also recognized NogoA. Given the promise of identifying 
a major inhibitory factor that, if blocked, might lead to im- 
proved regeneration of long axon pathways in the CNS, No- 
goA became a major focus of research on brain repair. These 
efforts resulted in a thorough characterization of NogoA and 
its receptor, but little resolution of the role in regeneration or 
therapeutic potential of this unusual protein. In experiments 
in which the NogoA gene or its receptor is inactivated in 
mice, there is no clear indication of significantly enhanced 
regeneration across sites of experimentally induced injury. 
Other experimental therapeutic approaches for treating 
spinal cord injury have had limited efficacy at best. There 
is some indication that peripheral glial cells in the olfactory 
nerve (called olfactory ensheathing cells), which support 
ongoing growth of axons from newly generated olfactory 
receptor neurons (see Figure 15.7), also may provide a more 
supportive substrate for the regrowth of damaged CNS ax- 
ons. However, this approach, like most others based on cel- 
lular or molecular observations in animal models, has yet to 
be validated clinically in humans. 
REPAIR AND REGENERATION IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 
575 
Neurogenesis in the Mature 
Central Nervous System 
Few issues in modern neuroscience have engendered as 
much controversy and consternation as the ability of the 
adult nervous system to generate new neurons in response 
to acute or degenerative damage to neural tissue. Until the 
advent of neuronal birthdating techniques (see Box 22D), 
there was no reliable way to assess the extent of cell pro- 
liferation and mitotic activity in the mature brain. Indeed, 
the neurogenesis that occurs in the peripheral olfactory 
epithelium of all mammals (see Chapter 15) remained the 
only unchallenged example for decades. Clinical experi- 
ence, buttressed by animal studies, indicated that the ma- 
ture brain was unlikely to undergo significant regeneration 
of functional nerve cells; however, there was a sense that 
some lower vertebrates (including frogs and birds) have 
a greater capacity than mammals for neurogenesis in re- 
sponse to brain injury. These animals also appeared able to 
support extensive reintegration of new or regrown axons 
and dendrites into existing circuits. This was recognized by 
the early 1950s, when several behavioral and anatomical 
studies of frogs evaluated reinnervation and topographic 
mapping of the optic tectum by eyes whose optic nerve had 
been damaged (see Chapter 23). The issue of whether this 
sort of repair was accompanied by the addition, differen- 
tiation, and maintenance of new neurons remained mostly 
unaddressed by these studies. 
The ability to label cells undergoing mitosis and to track 
their progeny led to a clear—albeit discouraging—assess- 
ment of the potential for generating new neurons in the 
adult mammalian brain. Quite simply, there did not seem 
to be extensive addition of neurons after the completion 
of pre- and early postnatal development. While this con- 
clusion had extensive support, some reservations were 
raised as early as the mid 1960s. Joseph Altman and his 
colleagues, then at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology, found that small numbers of granule neurons in 
the hippocampus and olfactory bulb in guinea pigs and 
rats could be heavily labeled with tritiated thymidine (a 
DNA component used to mark dividing cells; see Box 22D) 
injected at adult ages. Their work suggested that these 
(likely) inhibitory interneurons might be added to the brain 
during adulthood, either replacing or augmenting the co- 
hort generated during development. At the time, however, 
the lack of additional markers that identified these cells 
securely as neurons led other investigators to conclude 
that many, if not all, of these cells were newly generated 
glia rather than neurons. Moreover, it seemed relatively 
unlikely that proliferative activity of already differentiated 
neurons might generate such cells. 
Modern approaches have led to a much clearer under- 
standing of the identity of the sources and progeny of mi- 
totically active cells in the adult brain of many vertebrates, 

576 
CHAPTER 25 
including mammals. A low level of glial cell 
proliferation does indeed continue through- 
out life. Moreover, it is clear that existing, 
differentiated neurons do not de-differenti- 
ate and divide. Instead, at distinct locations 
in the brains of several species—including 
humans—there are regions where neural 
stem cells are maintained in the adult brain. 
As discussed in Chapter 22, the neural stem 
cells of the embryonic nervous system give 
rise to the full complement of cell classes 
found in neural tissue—i.e., neurons, astro- 
cytes, and oligodendroglia (see Box 22A), as 
well as to more neural stem cells. Appar- 
ently, mature central nervous systems in 
several vertebrates provide an environment 
that supports the maintenance of such mul- 
tipotent neural precursors. The extent to 
which these stem cells give rise to neurons 
that replace or augment existing populations 
varies depending on species, brain region, 
and the conditions (e.g., growth, seasonal 
change, injury) that influence neurogenesis 
in the adult brain. 
Adult Neurogenesis in Non- 
mammalian Vertebrates 
Observations in several non-mammalian 
vertebrate species, particularly in teleost fish 
and songbirds, make a strong case for the ca- 
pacity of adult vertebrate brains to add new 
neurons and incorporate them into func- 
tional circuits that guide behavior. One of 
the first thoroughly characterized examples 
of ongoing vertebrate adult neurogenesis is 
from the goldfish. Goldfish, like many other 
fish, continue to grow throughout their life- 
times. Their body growth is matched by the 
growth of sensory structures in the periph- 
ery, particularly the eye. By the early 1970s, 
several investigators had recognized that 
growth of the eye was accompanied by the 
generation of new retinal neurons. Subse- 
quent work showed that these neurons are 
generated from a subset of precursor or stem 
cells that form a ring around the entire mar- 
gin of the goldfish retina (Figure 25.12A). 
These cells are capable of generating all of 
the cell classes in the goldfish retina (with 
the exception of rod photoreceptors, which 
are regenerated by a distinct precursor cell; 
see Chapter 11 for a review of retinal cell 
classes). The new neurons integrate into the

Adult neurogenesis in non-mammalian vertebrates. (A) Given 
favorable environmental conditions, teleost fish such as goldfish grow throughout 
their entire adult lives; the growth of the fish's body is matched by the growth of its 
eyes and brain. The retina grows by adding new neurons generated from a population 
of stem cells distributed in a ring at the very margin of the retina (red). These stem cells 
give rise to all retinal cell types except the rods (which are regenerated from precursors 
found in the existing differentiated region of the retina). (B) In a process of ongoing 
adult neurogenesis, male songbirds such as the canary lose and replace significant 
numbers of neurons in forebrain nuclei that control the production and perception of 
song. These song-control centers include the HVC (higher vocal center), RA (robustus 
archistriatus), and "area X," which is the equivalent of the caudate nucleus in the mam- 
malian brain. In HVC, a population of radial stem cells is maintained. The cell bodies 
are adjacent to the ventricular space, and their processes extend into the neuropil of 
the nucleus. A subset of neurons is retained in the nucleus as new ones are added. 
Neuroblasts migrate from the ventricular zone along the radial processes of the precur- 
sor cells and then integrate into circuits with existing neurons. (A after Otteson and

existing retina in rings, or annulae, between the precursor 
cells at the periphery and the existing differentiated retina— 
much like yearly growth rings being added to tree trunks. 
The axons of the new retinal ganglion cells enter and grow 
through the optic nerve and tract to reinnervate the optic 
tectum. Most of this axon growth happens along the extra- 
cellular matrix deposited at the glial limiting membrane of 
the optic nerve—the equivalent of the basal lamina conduits 
made by Schwann cells in the periphery. Regeneration of 
all retinal cell classes can also happen in response to a local 
injury of existing retinal tissue; however, the details of how 
this repair is completed are somewhat different than that for 
ongoing addition of cells. As surprising as these remarkable 
capacities are, it is perhaps equally surprising that the optic 
tectum in the brain adds new neurons to accommodate the 
quantitative expansion of the retinal projection. These cells 
are not added in complementary rings; instead, populations 
of new neurons are added as crescents to the back of the 
tectum. Accordingly, the geometry of adult neurogenesis in 
the periphery and brain are mismatched. This divergence 
requires that new retinal inputs be constantly remapped 
along with existing retinal projections. Thus, there must be 
a great deal of dynamism in synaptic connections in the 
optic tectum of the adult goldfish. Connections must be 
made, broken, and re-made to maintain the integrity of the 
retinotopic map as the fish grows throughout its lifetime. 
An equally striking example of adult neurogenesis is 
found in several species of songbirds, including the canary 
and the zebra finch. This ongoing neurogenesis occurs in 
several regions of the avian brain; however, it has been 
most thoroughly studied in the structures that control vo- 
calization and perception of song (Figure 25.12B; see also 
Box 24B). In most male songbirds, there is continual loss 
and addition of neurons in these regions. In some, the cycle 
of loss and regeneration follows mating seasons and is un- 
der the control of gonadal steroids (see Chapter 30), while 
in others it occurs constantly. Although it is tempting to 
speculate that the new neurons are a substrate for flexible 
acquisition or production of songs, no definitive evidence 
confirms this speculation. Moreover, many birds that have 
significant amounts of adult neurogenesis in song-control 
regions show very little flexibility in their song after the 
critical period for song learning is complete in early life. 
Regardless of the behavioral consequences, it is estimated 
that birds replace most of the neurons in several song con- 
trol centers of their brain several times over a lifetime. The 
new neurons are generated from neural stem cells found in 
a limited region of the neural tissue immediately adjacent to 
the forebrain lateral ventricles. Stem cell bodies are found 
in this zone, and their radial processes (much like the radial 
glia that are the stem cells of the developing mammalian 
neocortex; see Chapter 22) extend into song control cen- 
ters (see Figure 25.12B). These cells function both as pre- 
cursors, generating new neurons via asymmetric divisions, 
REPAIR AND REGENERATION IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

and as migration guides that constrain the translocation of 
new neurons from the ventricular zone to the song con- 
trol nuclei. Many of the new neurons integrate themselves 
into existing circuits and have functional properties that are 
consistent with a contribution to song production or percep- 
tion. Nevertheless, a significant number die before they can 
fully differentiate, suggesting that there may be limits to the 
capacity of newly generated neurons to establish sufficient 
trophic support and activity-dependent validation to sur- 
vive. Such effects would be similar to the processes that limit 
neuron numbers during initial development in many spe- 
cies. A key feature of adult neurogenesis in the avian brain is 
that there is always a balance of existing, long-lived neurons 
and newly generated neurons. Thus, even this compelling 
example of adult neurogenesis occurs in the context of sig- 
nificant stability in the mature brain. 
Neurogenesis in the Adult 
Mammalian Brain 
Over the past decade, the mechanisms and extent of 
neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain have been 
examined (or reexamined) in mice, rats, monkeys, and 
humans. Clearly, defining the capacity for ongoing neu- 
ronal replacement in specific CNS regions would provide 
a model for how regeneration might be elicited following 
brain injury or to combat neurodegenerative disease. The 
results of these efforts to understand neurogenesis in the 
adult brain are quite clear. New nerve cells in the central 
nervous system are generated reliably in just two regions, 
the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus (Figure 25.13A). 
In addition to these two sites, there is clear evidence that 
olfactory receptor neurons in the periphery are continually 
replaced (see Figure 15.7). 
In the CNS, new nerve cells are primarily interneurons, 
either granule cells and periglomerular cells in the olfactory 
bulb (see Chapter 15), or granule cells in the hippocampus 
(see Chapters 8 and 31). These newly generated olfactory 
or hippocampal interneurons are apparently the progeny 
of precursor or stem cells located close to the surface of 
the lateral ventricles, relatively near to either the bulb or 
hippocampus. (In each case, however, some translocation 
from the site of final mitosis is required; see below.) New 
neurons with long-distance projections have not been ob- 
served in either the bulb or hippocampus. At least some 
new nerve cells become integrated into functional synap- 
tic circuits (Figure 25.13B,C); however, most new neurons 
generated in the adult brain die before being integrated 
into existing circuitry. No one has yet explained the func- 
tional significance of restricting neurogenesis to just these 
few regions in the adult brain, and the ultimate behavioral 
consequences for the addition of such cells in mammals 
remains unclear. Moreover, the death of most newly gener- 
ated neurons suggests that there may be a premium placed

on stability in the mammalian brain, thus limiting oppor- 
tunities for new neurons to join existing circuits. Neverthe- 
less, the fact that new neurons can be generated in at least 
a few adult brain regions shows that this phenomenon can 
occur in the mammalian CNS. 
Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms 
of Adult Neurogenesis 
In regenerating tissues such as intestine or lung, stem 
cells are found in a distinct location, or niche. Presumably 
there is a local environment within the stem cell niche,

Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian 
brain. (A) Neural precursors in the epithelial lining of the 
anterior lateral ventricles in the forebrain (a region called 
the anterior subventricular zone, or SVZ) give rise to post- 
mitotic neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb via a 
distinctive pathway known as the rostral migratory stream 
or RMS. Neuroblasts that migrate to the bulb via the RMS 
become either olfactory bulb granule cells or periglomerular 
cells; both cell types function as interneurons in the bulb. 
(B) In the mature hippocampus, a population of neural 
precursors is resident in the basal aspect of the granule cell 
layer of the dentate gyrus (the subgranular zone, or SGZ). 
These precursors give rise to postmitotic neuroblasts that 
translocate from the basal aspect of the granule cell layer to 
more apical levels. In addition, some of these neuroblasts 
elaborate dendrites and a local axonal process and appar- 
ently become GABAergic interneurons within the dentate 
gyrus. (C) A newly generated granule neuron (labeled green 
using a genetic marker) is contacted by GABAergic synapses

established by secreted signals as well as cell surface mol- 
ecules, conducive to the maintenance of stem cells as well 
as to the division and initial differentiation of cells that will 
reconstitute the adult tissue. In the adult mammalian olfac- 
tory bulb and hippocampus, new neurons are generated 
from the subgranular zone (SGZ) or anterior subventricu- 
lar zone (SVZ). The SGZ is a region of cells immediately 
adjacent to the granule cell layer of the hippocampus (see 
Figure 25.13B). The SVZ is a cell-dense region adjacent to 
the ventricular space found in the anterior aspect of the cor- 
tical hemispheres (Figure 25.14A; also see Figure 25.13A). 
These zones are quite similar to the neurogenic zones seen 
in lower vertebrates (see Figure 25.12). Adult stem cells

at the ventricular surface. The ciliated epen- 
dymal cells form a tight epithelial boundary 
separating cerebrospinal fluid from brain 
tissue. Immediately adjacent are neural 
stem cells, whose processes are intercalated 
between the ependyma and all other cell 
types. These stem cells are also often seen in 
proximity to blood vessels. Transit amplify- 
ing cells are also found in this domain, and 
their progeny—the neuroblasts—are often 
clustered close by prior to adhering to glia 
that guide them into the rostral migratory 
stream (see Figure 25.15). (B) Isolation and 
propagation in vitro of neural stem cells

and transit amplifying cells that has been 
generated clonally from a single founder dis-

epithelium. The adjacent three panels show 
differentiated cell types generated from the 
neurosphere. From left to right: oligoden-

can be isolated not only from the SVZ near the olfactory 
bulb (Figure 25.14B) and dentate gyrus, but also from sub- 
ventricular regions of the cerebellum, midbrain, and spinal 
cord. When isolated and maintained in culture, these stem 
cells can give rise to additional stem cells or to neurons and 
glia, depending on the experimental conditions (see Figure 
25.14B). In vivo, however, at sites beyond the olfactory bulb 
and hippocampus, stem cells do not appear to produce new 
neurons that are integrated into adjacent CNS regions. 
In the SVZ and SGZ, neural stem cells have many 
characteristics similar to astrocytes, including expressing 
multiple molecules that are also seen in astrocytes. Thus, 
similar to the developing brain (as well as in avian brains; 
see Figure 25.13B), the multipotent neural stem cell has an 
apparent glial rather than neuronal identity (see Chapter 
22). Furthermore, they are often found in close proximity 
to blood vessels, suggesting that they may be regulated by 
circulating as well as local signaling molecules. Although 
the route of delivery is different, this proximity to signals 
suggests that these precursors, like their developing coun- 
terparts, rely on cell-cell signaling to guide proliferation 
and differentiation. It is also possible that circulating signals

relay information about the overall physiological state of the 
animal, thus linking broader homeostatic mechanisms with 
neurogenesis in the adult brain. 
In order to generate differentiated neurons and glia, the 
neural stem cell must give rise to an intermediate precur- 
sor cell class, generally referred to as a transit amplifying 
cell. These cells retain the ability to divide; however, their 
cell cycles are much faster than those of stem cells, and 
they divide asymmetrically. After each cell division, a tran- 
sit amplifying cell gives rise to a postmitotic neuroblast or 
elioblast, plus another transit amplifying cell that reenters 
the cell cycle for an additional round of asymmetric divi- 
sion. Transit amplifying cells are limited in their number 
of divisions, and eventually their potential for generating 
postmitotic blast cells is exhausted. Thus, for neurogenesis 
to proceed, the transit amplifying cells must be replenished 
from the stem cell population. Neuroblast and glioblast 
cells are no longer competent to divide, and they move 
away from the SGZ or SVZ into regions of the olfactory 
bulb or hippocampus where mature neurons or glia are 
found. In the hippocampus, this distance is relatively small, 
and the cells undergo a modest displacement to reach their 
final position. For newly generated neurons destined for 
the olfactory bulb, however, the distance from the SVZ 
to the olfactory bulb is considerable. A specific migratory 
route, defined by a distinct subset of glial cells, facilitates 
migration of newly generated neurons from the anterior 
subventricular zone to the bulb. This route is referred to as 
the rostral migratory stream (Figure 25.15; also see Figure

migrating neurons in the RMS, via the ErbB4 neuregulin receptor. 
Finally, polysialyated N-CAM on the surfaces of newly generated 
neurons facilitates migration through the RMS. (C) Electron micro-

25.13A), and within it, neuroblasts move along channels 
defined by the surfaces of elongated glial cells (these glial 
cells do not have stem cell properties). In this migratory 
pathway, as at other sites of cell migration or axon growth, 
an extracellular matrix, presumably secreted by the glial 
cells, facilitates migration. In addition, the migrating cells 
express the polysialyated form of the neural cell adhesion 
molecule 
N-CAM, which promotes cell-cell interactions 
that facilitate migration. Secreted signaling molecules also 
influence migration in the rostral migratory stream. In this 
case, neuregulin, which also influences axon guidance and 
synapse formation in the periphery, facilitates motility via 
interaction with the ErbB4 neuregulin receptor. Thus, in 
the rostral migratory stream, a number of developmentally 
regulated adhesion molecules and secreted signals medi- 
ate migration of new neurons through otherwise mature 
brain tissue. 
Identification of molecular mediators of adult neuro- 
genesis remains a major focus of current research. The 
most attractive hypothesis, and one that has support from 
the available data, is that the signaling molecules and 
transcriptional regulators used to define neural stem cells 
early in development are either retained or reactivated to 
facilitate neurogenesis in the adult. Accordingly, many of 
the inductive signaling molecules described in Chapter 22 
as mediators of the specification of neural precursors and 
their progeny in the neural plate and neural tube are also 
active in adult subventricular zones. These include Sonic 
hedgehog (Shh), members of the fibroblast growth factor 
(FGF) family, TGF-8 family members (including the bone 
morphogenetic proteins or BMPs), and retinoic acid (RA). 
Similarly, many of the adhesion molecules that influence 
cell migration during neural development (see Figures 
23.3-23.5) also influence the migration of newly gener- 
ated neurons, especially those destined for the olfactory 
bulb that must move through the rostral migratory stream. 
Adult Neurogenesis, Stem Cells, 
and Brain Repair in Humans 
These examples of addition or replacement of neurons in 
the adult brains of fish, birds, rats, and mice provide clear 
examples of how new neurons may be integrated into exist- 
ing circuits, presumably preserving, replacing, or augment- 
ing function. In most cases, neuron replacement is gradual 
and likely related to ongoing low-level neurogenesis rather 
than to wholesale reconstitution of brain tissue in response 
to injury. Nevertheless, the limited capacity to replace neu- 
rons in an adult brain has offered some promise that, under 
the right conditions, neuron replacement might be used to 
repair the injured brain. In humans, the entire subventricu- 
lar zone of the cerebral hemispheres provides a supportive 
environment for neural stem cells. At present, however, 
there is no evidence that adult neurogenesis occurs out- 
side of the hippocampus. The rostral migratory stream is 
absent in humans, suggesting that ongoing neurogenesis 
in the ventricular zone does not produce new neurons 
that migrate to olfactory bulb. Moreover, the available evi- 
dence suggests that there is no neurogenesis in the adult 
cerebral cortex (Box 25C)—an observation that establishes 
a much higher threshold for the possibility of stem cell- 
mediated repair of cortical circuitry damaged by trauma, 
hypoxia, or neurodegenerative disease. Cell replacement 
therapies have been attempted in a relatively small number

The presence of stockpiles of nuclear 
weapons in an ever-increasing number 
of nations has always been a heavy 
burden for world affairs. It therefore 
_ May come as a surprise that the nuclear 
_ weapons testing carried out during the 
_ height of the Cold War (from the early 
_ 1950s through 1963) might play a posi- 
_ 
tive, if unanticipated, role in resolving a 
major conflict in neuroscience. 
In the late 1990s, a consensus 
_ emerged that the hippocampus and 
olfactory bulb are sites of gradual, lim- 
ited addition of new neurons in the 
adult brain of all mammalian species, 
including humans. This consensus, 
however, did not extend to the ques- 
tion of whether new neurons are added 
to the cerebral cortex in adulthood. If 
adults do indeed add new neurons in 
significant numbers, such a mecha- 
nism would demand revision of cur- 
rent notions of plasticity, learning, 
and memory; it would also offer new 
avenues for treating traumatic, hypoxic, 
and neurodegenerative cortical dam- 
age. Several reports in the mid 1990s, 
including some from experiments on 
non-human primates, suggested that 
there might be substantial addition of 
neurons to the adult cortex. Despite the 
provocative nature and exciting impli- 
cations of these findings, several other 
laboratories had difficulty replicating 
the surprising and controversial results. 
The disparities engendered a polarized 
debate with no easy resolution. Clearly, 
what was needed was an independent 
means of assessing neurogenesis in the 
adult cortex, preferably in humans. 
In a unique approach—and in one 
of the more successful searches for evi- 
dence of weapons of mass destruction 
in the last several years—Jonas Friesen 
and colleagues at the Karolinska 
Institute in Stockholm took advan- 
tage of fluctuations in environmental 
exposure to radioisotopes from nuclear 
weapons testing to evaluate when corti- 
cal neurons are indeed generated over 
an individual's lifetime (see Bhardwaj, 
2006). Their method relied on the rec- 
ognition that the normally steady state 
of the isotope carbon-14 ("C) in Earth's

atmosphere had been dramatically 
altered for a brief period between the 
mid 1950s and the early 1960s. During 
this time, many countries conducted 
multiple tests of nuclear weapons, 
introducing large amounts of ionizing 
radiation into the atmosphere and 
nearly doubling the atmospheric con- 
centration of "C, The Atomic Test Ban 
treaty of 1963 (which was adhered to by 
most countries until fairly recently) put 
a fairly abrupt end to this frightening 
period in human history, and atmo- 
spheric "C levels declined exponentially 
(Figure A). 
This change in atmospheric C con- 
centration provided a natural version 
of experimental birthdating techniques 
described in Box 22D. Rather than 
injecting a bolus of tritiated thymi- 
dine or BrdU into the subject, people 
of varying ages had been naturally 
exposed to a "bolus" of "C that was 
incorporated into DNA being synthe- 
sized at the time. Thus, regardless of 
the age of the subject, cortical neurons 
generated between 1955 and 1963 
should have a higher concentration of 
4C in their nucleus than those gener- 
ated before or after that time frame. 
To assess neurogenesis in this inge- 
nious way, the researchers obtained 
autopsy samples from the cerebral cor- 
tices of seven individuals born between 
1933 and 1973. The logic was that those 
born before 1955 would have signifi- 
cant numbers of "C labeled neurons 
due to exposure as adults only if there 
was indeed adult cortical neurogenesis. 
If there was no adult neurogenesis, 
(A) Changes in atmospheric '*C levels 
(right) and the availability of the isotope 
for incorporation into mitotic neurons at 
different times between 1955 (the start of 
frequent nuclear testing) and 1963 (when 
the Atomic Test Ban Treaty was put in 
place). Neurons generated between 1963 
and 1970, whether in adults or in individ- 
uals who underwent gestation and birth 
during that time frame, would incorpo- 
rate significant amounts of "*C into their 
nuclear DNA. (After Au and Fishell, 2006.) 
only those individuals born during (or 
shortly after) 1955-1963 should have 
4C-containing cortical neurons. To 
insure that only cortical neurons were 
assessed, dissociated cortical cells were 
labeled fluorescently with a neuron- 
specific marker and then sorted so that 
a comparison could be made between 
fluorescent-tagged neurons and the 
non-fluorescent glia and supporting 
cells (non-neurons). "C levels were 
then measured using accelerator mass 
spectroscopy. 
The results were very clear: 
Individuals born before 1955 had no 
cortical neurons with elevated "C lev- 
els; thus, no neurons had been gener- 
ated in their adult cortices (Figure B, 
top). In contrast, individuals born after 
1955, but before the return of C levels 
to baseline, had significant numbers of 
M4C_labeled neurons; furthermore, the 
neuronal level of *C corresponded to 
the atmospheric level around the time 
of their gestation and birth (Figure B, 
bottom). The different values for the 
non-neural cells indicate that these 
cells turn over, so their "*C content 
declines because of dilution by subse- 
quent rounds of DNA synthesis and cell 
division. 
To amplify this result, Friesen and 
colleagues studied a group of patients 
who had skin cancers and whose treat- 
ment included injections of thymidine 
analogs such as BrdU. They then

Furthermore, in both cases, the neuronal 
level of '*C corresponded to the atmo- 
spheric level at around the time of their 
gestation and birth. The slightly elevated 
levels for non-neural cells in the 1952 indi- 
vidual, and the lower levels in the 1968

however, BrdU does label glial cells, 
recognized with antibodies against glial 
fibrillary protein (Figure C). This obser- 
vation, especially when taken together 
with the "C study, argues strongly 
against significant neurogenesis in the 
adult cerebral cortex.

overall effectiveness of such treatments has been limited. 
Furthermore, the extent to which truly undifferentiated hu- 
man neural stem cells can be made to acquire and maintain 
characteristics of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia 
nigra (or any other distinctive neuronal identity) as well as 
an appropriate pattern of synaptic connections is unclear. 
Thus, although there is some promise in understanding on- 
going neural replacement in limited regions of the healthy 
adult brain for repairing the damaged brain, the fulfillment 
of this promise may be extremely challenging. 
Summary 
There are three types of repair in the adult nervous sys- 
tem, in addition to functional reorganization of surviving 
neurons and circuits following brain damage. The first and 
most effective is the regrowth of severed peripheral axons 
(usually via the peripheral nerve sheaths once occupied by 
their forerunners) and the reestablishment of sensory and 
motor synapses on muscles or other targets. During this 
regeneration, mature Schwann cells provide many of the 
molecules. The second, and far more limited, type of repair 
is local sprouting or longer extension of axons and dendrites 
at sites of traumatic damage or degenerative pathology in 
the brain or spinal cord. Major impediments to such local 
repair include the death of damaged neurons due to trophic 
deprivation or other stress; inhibition of nerve growth by 
cytokines released during the immune response to brain tis- 
sue damage; and the formation of a glial scar by extensive 
hypertrophy of existing glial cells plus limited proliferation of 
glia at the site of the injury. The pathologic assembly of glial 
cell bodies and processes into a scar erects an impenetrable 
barrier to axon growth. In addition, glia—especially oligo- 
dendroglia, which normally produce CNS myelin—produce 
molecules that inhibit axon growth and synapse formation 
during development. The third type of repair is the ongo- 
ing generation of new neurons in the adult brain. Although 
there is no evidence for wholesale replacement of neurons 
and circuits in most vertebrate brains, the capacity for more 
limited neuronal replacement exists in many species. In 
most mammals, the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus 
are sites of adult neurogenesis. In both brain regions, new 
neurons are generated by neural stem cells retained in spe- 
cific restricted locations, or niches, in the adult brain. Many 
of the molecules that regulate the maintenance, prolifera- 
tion, and differentiation of adult neural stem cells and their 
progeny are used for similar purposes for neural stem cells 
in the embryonic brain. The limited prospects of developing 
this capacity to generate new neurons as a strategy for repair 
following brain injury or degenerative disease continue to 
captivate the imagination of patients and their physicians 
and motivate the efforts of many neuroscientists.

THE AWARENESS OF PHYSICAL and social circumstances 
and the ability to have thoughts and feelings (emotions), to be 
sexually attracted to others, to use language to express these 
things 
to our fellow humans, and to store and access informa- 
tion in memory rank among the most intriguing functions of 
the human brain. Given the importance of these functions for 
human culture, it is not surprising that much of the human 
brain is devoted to these and other complex mental functions. 
The intrinsic interest of these aspects of human behavior is 
unfortunately equaled by the difficulty—both technical and 
conceptual—involved in unraveling their neurobiological 
underpinnings. Nonetheless, over the last century a good deal 
of progress has been made in deciphering the structural and 
functional organization of the relevant brain regions. Especially 
important has been the steady accumulation of case studies 
that, by the signs and symptoms resulting from damage to 
specific brain regions, have indicated much about the primary 
location of the different complex brain functions. More recently, 
the advent of noninvasive brain imaging techniques has pro- 
vided a much deeper understanding of some of these abilities 
in normal human subjects as well as in neurological patients. 
Finally, complementary electrophysiological experiments in 
non-human primates and other experimental animals have 
begun to elucidate the cellular correlates of many of these 
functions. Taken together, these observations have established 
a rapidly growing body of knowledge about the more complex 
aspects of the human brain. This general domain of investiga- 
tion has come to be called cognitive neuroscience and is a field 
that promises to offer greater insight into particularly human 
brain functions.

ASSOCIATION CORTEX 
AND COGNITION 
Overview 
THE ASSOCIATION CORTICES INCLUDE most of the cerebral surface of the 
human brain and are largely responsible for the complex processing that goes on 
between the arrival of input to the primary sensory cortices and the generation of 
behavior. The diverse functions of the association cortices are loosely referred to as 
cognition, which literally means the process by which we come to know the world. 
("Cognition" is perhaps not the best word to indicate this wide range of neural func- 
tions, but it has become part of the working vocabulary of neurologists and neurosci- 
entists.) More specifically, cognition refers to the ability to attend to external stimuli 
or internal motivation; to identify the significance of such stimuli; and to make ap- 
propriate responses. Given the complexity of these tasks, it is not surprising that the 
association cortices receive and integrate information from a variety of sources and 
that they influence a broad range of other cortical and subcortical targets. Inputs to 
the association cortices include projections from the primary and secondary sensory 
and motor cortices, the thalamus, and the brainstem. Outputs from the association 
cortices reach the hippocampus, the basal ganglia and cerebellum, the thalamus, and 
other cortical areas. Initial insight into the function of these cortical regions came 
primarily from observations of human patients with damage to one or another of 
these areas. Subsequent noninvasive brain imaging of normal subjects, functional 
mapping at neurosurgery, and electrophysiological analysis of comparable brain re- 
gions in non-human animals have generally confirmed clinical deductions. Together, 
these studies indicate that, among other functions, the parietal association cortex is 
especially important for attending to stimuli in the external and internal environ- 
ment; that the temporal association cortex is especially important for identifying the 
nature of such stimuli; and that the frontal association cortex is especially important 
for selecting and planning appropriate behavioral responses. 
The Association Cortices 
The preceding chapters have considered in some detail the parts of the brain re- 
sponsible for encoding sensory information and commanding movements (i.e., the 
primary sensory and motor cortices). But these regions account for only a fraction

of the human brain show the association

motor regions of the neocortex are shown 
in yellow. Notice that the primary cortices 
occupy a relatively small fraction of the total 
area of the cortical mantle. The remainder of

association cortices—is the seat of human 
cognitive ability. The term association refers 
to the fact that these regions of the cortex

(perhaps one-fifth) of the cerebral cortex. The consensus has 
long been that much of the remaining cortex is concerned 
with attending to complex stimuli, identifying the relevant 
features of such stimuli, recognizing the related objects, and 
planning appropriate responses (as well as storing aspects of 
this information). Collectively, these integrative abilities are 
referred to as cognition, and it is evidently the association 
cortices in the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes that make 
cognition possible. (The extrastriate cortex of the occipital 
lobe is equally important in cognition; its functions, how- 
ever, are largely concerned with vision, and much of what is

These areas of the cerebral cortex are referred to collectively 
as the association cortices (Figure 26.1). 
An Overview of Cortical Structure 
Before delving into a more detailed account of the func- 
tions of the different regions of the association cortices, it is 
important to have a general understanding of cortical struc- 
ture and the organization of its canonical circuitry. Most of 
the cortex that covers the cerebral hemispheres is neocor- 
tex, defined as cortex that has six cellular layers, also called 
FIGURE 26.2 
Structure of the human neocortex, including the 
association cortices. (A) Summary of the cellular composition of the six layers 
of the neocortex. (B) Based on variations in the thickness, cell density, and other 
histological features of the six neocortical laminae, the human brain can be divided 
into some 50 cytoarchitectonic areas, typically those recognized by the neuroanat- 
omist Korbinian Brodmann in his seminal 1909 monograph (see Box 26A). 

laminae. Each layer comprises more or less dis- 
tinctive populations of cells based on their differ- 
ent densities, sizes, shapes, inputs, and outputs. 
The laminar organization and basic connectivity 
of the human cerebral cortex are summarized in 
Figure 26.2A and Table 26.1. Despite an overall 
uniformity, regional differences based on these 
laminar features have long been apparent (Box 
26A), allowing investigators to identify numer- 
ous subdivisions of the cerebral cortex (Figure 
26.2B). These histologically defined subdivisions 
are referred to as cytoarchitectonic areas, and, 
over the years, a zealous band of neuroanato- 
mists has painstakingly mapped these areas in 
humans and in many of the more widely used 
laboratory animals. 
Early in the twentieth century, cytoarchitectonically 
distinct regions were identified with little or no knowl- 
edge of their functional significance. Eventually, studies 
of patients in whom one or more of these cortical areas 
had been damaged, supplemented by electrophysiologi- 
cal mapping in both laboratory animals and neurosurgical 
patients, supplied this information. This work showed that 
many of the regions neuroanatomists had distinguished 
on histological grounds are also functionally distinct. 
Thus, cytoarchitectonic areas can sometimes be identified

by the physiological response properties of their constitu- 
ent cells, and often by their patterns of local and long- 
distance connections. 
Despite significant variations among different cytoarchi- 
tectonic areas, the circuitry of all cortical regions has some 
common features (Figure 26.3). First, each cortical layer 
has a primary source of inputs and a primary output tar- 
get. Second, each area has connections in the vertical axis 
* (called columnar or radial connections) and connections in 
the horizontal axis (called lateral or horizontal connections). 
Third, cells with similar functions tend to be arrayed in ra- 
dially aligned groups that span all the cortical layers and 
receive inputs that are often segregated into radial bands or 
columns. Finally, interneurons within specific cortical layers 
give rise to extensive local axons that extend horizontally in 
the cortex, often linking functionally similar groups of cells. 
The particular circuitry of any cortical region is a variation 
on this canonical pattern of inputs, outputs, and vertical and 
horizontal patterns of connectivity. 
Unique Features of the 
Association Cortices 
The connectivity of the association cortices is appreciably 
different from primary and secondary sensory and motor 
cortices, particularly with respect to inputs and outputs. 
For instance, two thalamic nuclei that are not involved 
in relaying primary motor or sensory information provide 
much of the subcortical input to the association cortices: 
the pulvinar projects to the parietal association cortex, 
while the medial dorsal nuclei project to the frontal as- 
sociation cortex. Several other thalamic nuclei, including 
the anterior and ventral anterior nuclei, innervate the as- 
sociation cortices as well. 
Unlike the thalamic nuclei that receive peripheral sen- 
sory information and project to primary sensory cortices, 
the input to these association cortex-projecting nuclei 
comes from other regions of the cortex. In consequence, the 
signals coming into the association cortices via the thala- 
mus reflect sensory and motor information that has already

res 
| picture of brain structure at the 
2 es 
_ histological level. The most striking 
_ feature revealed in this way is the 
_ distinctive lamination of the cortex 
_ in humans and other mammals, as 
' seen in the figure. Humans have 
three to six cortical layers, depend- 
_ ing on the area of cortex. These 
layers, or laminae, are designated 
| with the numerals 1-6 (or with 
Roman numerals I-VI). Laminar 
subdivisions are indicated with 
_ 
letters (layers 4a, 4b, and 4c of the 
visual cortex, for example). 
Each of the cortical laminae 
in the so-called neocortex (which 
_ covers the bulk of the cerebral 
hemispheres and is defined by 
six layers) has characteristic func- 
tional and anatomical features 
(see Figures 26.2 and 26.3). For 
example, cortical layer 4 is typi- 
cally rich in stellate neurons with 
locally ramifying axons; in the 
primary sensory cortices, these 
neurons receive input from the 
Paleocortex

primary sensory and motor cortices. 
Not all cortex is six-layered neocor- 
tex. The hippocampal cortex, which lies 
deep in the temporal lobe and has been 
implicated in acquisition of declarative 
memories (see Chapter 31), has 
only three or four laminae. The 
hippocampal cortex is regarded 
as evolutionarily more primitive 
and is therefore called archicor- 
tex (archi, "first") to distinguish 
it from the six-layered neocortex. 
Another, presumably even more 
primitive, type of cortex is the 
paleocortex (paleo, "ancient"); 
paleocortex generally has three 
layers and is found on the ven- 
tral surface of the cerebral hemi- 
spheres and along the parahip- 
pocampal gyrus in the medial 
temporal lobe. 
The functional significance 
of different numbers of lami- 
nae in neocortex, archicortex, 
and paleocortex is not known, 
although it seems likely that 
the greater number of layers in 
neocortex reflects more complex

to a lesser degree layer 6, contain 
pyramidal neurons whose axons 
typically leave the cortex. The

been processed in the primary sensory and motor areas of 
the cerebral cortex and is being fed back to the association 
regions. The primary sensory cortices, in contrast, receive 
thalamic information that is more directly related to pe- 
ripheral sense organs (see Unit II). Similarly, much of the 
thalamic input to primary motor cortex is derived from the 
thalamic nuclei related to the basal ganglia and cerebellum 
rather than to other cortical regions (see Unit III). 
A second major difference in the sources of innervation 
to the association cortices is their enrichment in projections 
from other cortical areas, called corticocortical connections 
(see Figure 26.3). Indeed, these connections form the major- 
ity of the input to the association cortices. Ipsilateral cortico- 
cortical connections arise from primary and secondary sen- 
sory and motor cortices, and from other association cortices 
within the same hemisphere. Corticocortical connections 

also arise from both corresponding and noncorresponding 
cortical regions in the opposite hemisphere via the corpus 
callosum and anterior commissure, which together are re- 
ferred to as interhemispheric connections. In the associa- 
tion cortices of humans and other primates, corticocortical 
connections often form segregated radial bands or columns 
in which interhemispheric projection bands are interdigi- 
tated with bands of ipsilateral corticocortical projections. 
Another important source of innervation to the asso- 
ciation areas is subcortical, arising from the dopaminergic 
nuclei in the midbrain, the noradrenergic and serotonergic 
nuclei in the brainstem reticular formation, and cholinergic 
nuclei in the brainstem and basal forebrain. These diffuse 
inputs project to different cortical layers and, among other 
functions, contribute to learning, motivation, and arousal 
(the continuum of mental states that ranges from deep 
sleep to high alert; see Chapter 28). A variety of behavioral 
and psychiatric disorders, including addiction, depression, 
and attention deficit disorder, are associated with dysfunc- 
tion in one or more of these neuromodulatory circuits. 
Current pharmacological therapies for these diseases rely 
on manipulation of signaling via modulatory inputs to the 
association cortices. 
The general wiring plan for the association cortices is 
summarized in Figure 26.4. Despite this degree of intercon- 
nectivity, the extensive inputs and outputs of the associa- 
tion cortices should not be taken to imply that everything 
is simply connected to everything else in these regions. On 
the contrary, each association area is defined by a distinct, 
if overlapping, subset of thalamic, corticocortical, and sub- 
cortical connections. It is nonetheless difficult to conclude 
much about the role of these different cortical areas based 
solely on connectivity. This information is, 
in any event, quite limited for the human 
association cortices; most of the evidence

homologous regions of the brains of experimental animals, 
as well as in humans using noninvasive imaging techniques. 
The Parietal Association Cortex 
Mediates Attention 
In 1941, the British neurologist W. R. Brain reported three 
patients with unilateral parietal lobe lesions in whom the 
primary problem was varying degrees of difficulty paying at- 
tention to objects and events contralateral to the lesion. Brain 
described their peculiar deficiency in the following way: 
Though not suffering from a loss of topographical 
memory or an inability to describe familiar routes, they 
nevertheless got lost in going from one room to another 
in their own homes, always making the same error of 
choosing a right turning instead of a left, or a door on the 
right instead of one on the left. In each case there was a 
massive lesion in the right parieto-occipital region, and it 
is suggested that this ... resulted in an inattention to or 
neglect of the left half of external space. 
The patient who is thus cut off from the sensations which 
are necessary for the construction of a body scheme may 
react to the situation in several different ways. He may 
remember that the limbs on his left side are still there, 
or he may periodically forget them until reminded of 
their presence. He may have an illusion of their absence, 
ie. they may 'feel absent' although he knows that they 
are there; he may believe that they are absent but allow

W. R. Brain, 1941 (Brain 64: pp. 257 and 264) 
This description is generally considered to be the first account 
of the link between parietal lobe lesions and deficits in atten- 
tion or perceptual awareness. Based on a large number of 
patients studied since Brain's pioneering work, these deficits 
are now referred to as contralateral neglect syndrome. 
The hallmark of contralateral neglect syndrome is an in- 
ability to attend to objects, or even one's own body, in a por- 
tion of space, despite the fact that visual acuity, somatic sen- 
sation, and motor ability remain intact. Affected individuals 
fail to report, respond to, or even orient to stimuli presented 
to the side of the body (or visual space) opposite the lesion 
(Figure 26.5). They may also have difficulty performing com- 
plex motor tasks on the neglected side, including dressing 
themselves, reaching for objects, writing, drawing, and, to 
a lesser extent, orienting to sounds. These motor deficits are 
called apraxias (Greek, "no actions"). The signs of the syn- 
drome can be as subtle as a temporary lack of contralateral 
attention that improves rapidly as the patient recovers, or as

profound as permanent denial of the existence of the side of 
the body and extrapersonal space opposite the lesion. Since 
Brain's original description of contralateral neglect and its 
relationship to lesions of the parietal lobe, it has been gener- 
ally accepted that the parietal cortex, particularly the inferior 
parietal lobe, is the primary cortical region (but not the only 
region) governing attention (Figure 26.6A). 
Importantly, contralateral neglect syndrome is typically 
associated with damage to the right parietal cortex. The 
unequal distribution of this particular cognitive function 
between the hemispheres is thought to arise because the 
right parietal cortex mediates attention to both left and right 
halves of the body and extrapersonal space, whereas the left 
hemisphere mediates attention primarily to the right (Figure 
26.6B); this hemispheric bias is thought to arise from special- 
ization of the left hemisphere for language, thereby driving 
attentive functions into the right hemisphere (see Chapter 
27). Thus, left parietal lesions tend to be compensated by the 
intact right hemisphere. In contrast, when the right parietal 
cortex is damaged, there is little or no compensatory capacity 
in the left hemisphere to mediate attention to the left side of 
the body or extrapersonal space. This interpretation has been 
confirmed by noninvasive imaging of parietal lobe activity 
during specific attention tasks carried out by normal subjects. 
Such studies show that neural activity is increased in both 
the right and left parietal cortices when subjects are asked 
to perform tasks in the right visual field requiring selective 
attention to distinct aspects of a visual stimulus such as its 
shape, velocity, or color. However, when a similar challenge 
is presented in the left visual field, typically the right parietal 
cortex is activated, although left parietal cortical activity is 
often observed as well (Figure 26.7). There is also evidence of

preserved attention within the right hemisphere. Bilateral parietal lesions cause

When attention is shifted from the left visual

remains active, but activity is apparent in the 
left parietal cortex as well. This arrangement 
implies that damage to the left parietal lobe 
does not generate right-sided hemineglect 
because the right parietal lobe also serves this 
function. (After Posner and Raichle, 1994.)

field, contralateral neglect patients, as expected, tend to 
eliminate more lines on the right side of the field than on 
the left, consistent with a disruption in attentiveness to the 
left visual field (see Figure 26.5C). The lines they draw, 
however, tend to be biased toward the right side of each 
nonvertical line, no matter where the line happens to fall in 
the visual field. These observations suggest that attentive- 
ness relies on a frame of reference anchored to the locations 
of objects and their relative dimensions. 
Disruptions in spatial frames of reference are also as- 
sociated with lesions of the parietal cortex that are more 
dorsal and medial than those typically associated with 
classical neglect. Such damage often presents as a triad of 
visuospatial deficits known as Balint's syndrome (named af- 
ter the Austro-Hungarian neurologist who first described 
this condition). The three signs are an inability to perceive 
parts of a complex visual scene as a whole (called simultan- 
agnosia), deficits in visually guided reaching (optic ataxia), 
and difficulty in voluntary scanning of visual scenes (ocular 
apraxia). In contrast to classical neglect, optic ataxia and 
ocular apraxia typically remit when movements are guided 
by nonvisual cues. These observations suggest that the pa- 
rietal cortex participates in the construction of spatial rep- 
resentations that can guide both attention and movement. 
"Attention Neurons" in the 
Monkey Parietal Cortex 
These clinical and brain imaging observations do not, how- 
ever, provide much insight into how the nervous system 
represents cognitive information in nerve cells and their 
interconnections. The apparent functions of the association 
cortices implied by clinical observations stimulated a num- 
ber of informative electrophysiological studies in non-human 
primates, particularly macaque (usually rhesus) monkeys. 
As in humans, a wide range of cognitive abilities in mon- 
keys are mediated by the association cortices of the pari- 
etal, temporal, and frontal lobes (Figure 26.8A). Moreover, 
these functions can be tested using behavioral paradigms 
that assess attention, identification, and planning capabili- 
ties—the broad functions assigned to the parietal, temporal, 
and frontal association cortices, respectively, in humans. By 
means of implanted electrodes, recordings from single neu- 
rons in the brains of awake, behaving monkeys are used to 
assess the activity of individual cells in the brain as various 
tasks are performed (Figure 26.8B). 
Neurons in the parietal cortex of monkeys have been 
studied using this approach. The studies take advantage of 
the fact that monkeys can be trained to selectively attend to 
particular objects or events and report their experience ina 
variety of nonverbal ways, typically by looking at a response 
target (thus allowing their eye movements to be monitored) 
or manipulating a joystick. Attention-sensitive neurons can 
be identified by recording electrophysiological changes in

neuronal activity associated with simultaneous changes in 
the attentive behavior of the animal. As might be expected 
from the clinical evidence in humans, neurons in specific 
regions of the parietal cortex of the rhesus monkey are ac- 
tivated when the animal attends to a target, but not when 
the same stimulus is ignored (Figure 26.9A). 
In another study, monkeys were rewarded with different 
amounts of fruit juice (a highly desirable treat) for attending 
to each of a pair of simultaneously illuminated targets (Figure

rate increases dramatically when the monkey attends

given a choice of where to attend, the monkey pays 
increasing attention to a particular visual target when 
more fruit juice reward can be expected for doing so 
(left), and the firing rate of the parietal neuron under 
study increases accordingly (A after Lynch et al., 1977; 
B after Platt and Glimcher, 1999.) 
26.9B). Not surprisingly, the frequency with which monkeys 
attended to each target varied with the amount of juice they 
learned to expect for doing so. Moreover, the activity of some 
neurons in parietal cortex varied systematically as a func- 
tion of the amount of juice associated with each target, and 
therefore the amount of attention paid by the monkey to 
the target. Thus, the primate parietal cortex contains neurons 
that respond specifically when the animal attends to a behav- 
iorally meaningful stimulus, and the vigor of the response 
reflects the amount of attention paid to the stimulus. 
Intuitively, paying attention to a stimulus—whether to 
a face in a crowd or a conversation at a crowded party— 
makes it easier to perceive that stimulus and facilitates ap- 
propriate behavioral responses. Indeed, behavioral studies

in people and animals indicate that attended stimuli are 
responded to more quickly and more accurately than un- 
attended stimuli. Such improvements in perception and 
action suggest that the underlying neuronal response to 
the attended stimulus is somehow improved as well. Re- 
cent neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies sup- 
port this hypothesis. For example, fMRI scans of human 
subjects asked to pay attention to a visual stimulus in the 
lower visual hemifield reveal enhanced neural responses 
to those stimuli in the corresponding retinotopic portion 
of the contralateral occipital cortex (Figure 26.10A; see also 
Chapter 12). Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings 
from single neurons in extrastriate visual cortex in monkeys 
reveal enhanced responses to visual stimuli when they are 
attended compared with when they are unattended (Figure 
FIGURE 26.10

tex. (A) When human subjects are instructed 
to attend to visual stimuli such as numbers and

cortex increases. (B) Responses of a single neu- 
ron in extrastriate visual cortex to a bar flashed

These data suggest that attention improves 
perceptual performance by selectively enhanc- 
ing neuronal responses in the relevant sensory 
cortex. (A from Woldorff et al., 1997; B after

26.10B). Such attention-related enhancement of neuronal 
responses in visual cortex seems likely to be responsible for 
the improvement in the speed and accuracy of behavioral 
responses to attended stimuli. Similar attention-related 
improvements in neuronal sensitivity have been found in 
auditory cortex for sounds and somatosensory cortex for 
tactile stimuli. The increased responsiveness of neurons in 
the sensory cortex to attended stimuli seems likely to be 
driven by inputs from attention-directing neurons in the 
parietal and prefrontal cortex. 
The Temporal Association Cortex 
Mediates Recognition 
Clinical evidence from patients with lesions of the association 
cortex in the temporal lobe indicates that one of the major 
functions of this part of the brain is the recognition and iden- 
tification of stimuli that are attended to, particularly com- 
plex stimuli. Thus, damage to either temporal lobe can result 
in difficulty recognizing, identifying, and naming different 
categories of objects. These disorders, collectively called ag- 
nosias (Greek, "unknown'"), are quite different from the 
neglect syndromes. As noted, patients with right parietal 
lobe damage often deny awareness of sensory information 
in the left visual field (and are less attentive to the left sides 
of objects generally), despite the fact that the sensory systems 
are intact (an individual with contralateral neglect syndrome 
typically withdraws his left arm in response to a pinprick, 
even though he may not admit to the arm's existence). Pa- 
tients with agnosia, on the other hand, acknowledge the 
presence of a stimulus, but are unable to report what it is. 
Agnosias have both a lexical aspect (a mismatching of verbal 
or other cognitive symbols with sensory stimuli; see Chapter 
27) and a mnemonic aspect (a failure to recall stimuli when 
confronted with them again; see Chapter 31).

One of the most thoroughly studied agnosias following 
damage to the temporal association cortex in humans is the 
inability to recognize and identify faces. This disorder, called 
prosopagnosia (Greek prosopon, "face" or "person"), was 
recognized by neurologists in the late nineteenth century and 
remains an area of intense investigation. After damage to the 
inferior temporal cortex, typically on the right, patients are 
often unable to identify familiar individuals by their facial 
characteristics, and in some cases cannot recognize a face 
at all. Nonetheless, such individuals are perfectly aware that 
some sort of visual stimulus is present and can describe par- 
ticular aspects or elements of it without difficulty. 
An example is the case of L.H., a patient described by 
the neuropsychologist N. L. Etcoff and colleagues. L.H. (the 
use of initials to identify neurological patients in published 
reports is standard practice) was a 40-year-old minister and 
social worker who sustained a severe head injury in an auto- 
mobile accident when he was 18. After recovery, he could not 
recognize familiar faces, report that they were familiar, or an- 
swer questions about faces from memory. He could identify 
common objects, could discriminate subtle shape differences, 
and could recognize the sex, age, and even the "likeability" of 
faces. Moreover, he could identify particular people by non- 
facial cues such as voice, body shape, and gait. The only other 
category of visual stimuli he had trouble recognizing was ani- 
mals and their expressions, though these impairments were 
not as severe as for human faces, and he was able to lead a 
fairly normal and productive life. Noninvasive brain imaging

"Recognition Neurons" in the 
Monkey Temporal Cortex 
In keeping with human deficits of recognition following tem- 
poral lobe lesions, neurons with responses that correlate with 
the recognition of specific stimuli are present in the tempo- 
ral cortex of rhesus monkeys (Figure 26.13). The behavior of 
(A) 
Inferior 
temporal 
cortex 
these neurons is generally consistent with one of the major 
functions ascribed to the human temporal cortex, namely, 
the recognition and identification of complex stimuli. For 
example, some neurons in the inferior temporal gyrus of the 
rhesus monkey cortex respond specifically to the presenta- 
tion of a monkey face. These cells are often quite selective; 
some respond only to the frontal view of a face, others only to 
profiles (Figure 26.13B,C). Furthermore, the cells are not eas- 
ily deceived. When parts of faces or generally similar objects 
are presented, such cells typically fail to respond; in fact, the 
only things that confuse face-selective neurons are round or 
fuzzy objects such as apples, clock faces, or toilet brushes— 
all of which are vaguely facelike in appearance. 
In principle, it is unlikely that such "face cells" are tuned 
to specific faces or objects. However, it is not hard to imag- 
ine that populations of neurons differently responsive to 
various features of faces or other objects could act in concert 
to enable the recognition of such complex sensory stimuli. 
The notion of such "population coding" of objects is sup- 
ported by the recent observation that face-selective neu- 
ronal responses in the temporal cortex of monkeys vary in 
intensity with respect to an average face. Both monkeys 
and humans are better at recognizing faces having extreme

this case responds selectively to faces seen 
from the front. Facial images in which parts 
have been scrambled (stimulus 2) or omit- 
ted (stimulus 3) do not elicit a maximal 
response. The cell responds best to different 
monkey faces, as long as they are complete 
and viewed from the front (stimulus 4); the 
cell also responds to a bearded human face 
(stimulus 5), although not quite as robustly. 
An irrelevant stimulus (a hand; stimulus 6) 
does not elicit a response. (C) In this example, 
the neuron being recorded from responds to

features—caricatures—than they are at recognizing less 
distinctive faces, suggesting that faces are identified by 
comparison with a mental standard or norm. Similarly, 
neurons in the inferior temporal cortex of monkeys respond 
much more strongly to caricatures of human faces than to 
an "average" human face, which is represented by the aver- 
age activity of the neuronal population. Such norm-based 
tuning has also been reported for neuronal responses to 
shapes in the inferior temporal cortex. 
Recent studies suggest that such complex response prop- 
erties may be based on a columnar anatomical arrangement 
similar to that in the primary visual cortex (see Chapter 12). 
Each column has been taken to represent different arrange- 
ments of complex features making up an object, the overall 
spatial pattern of neuronal activity representing the object 
in view. In keeping with this general idea, optical imag- 
ing of the surface of the temporal cortex shows that large 
populations of neurons are activated when monkeys view 
an object comprising several different geometric features. 
(A) 
a 
ASSOCIATION CORTEX AND COGNITION 
599 
The locus of this activity in the upper layers of the cortex 
shifts systematically when object features, such as the ori- 
entation of a face, are systematically altered (Figure 26.14). 
Taken together, these further observations suggest that 
object identification relies on graded signals carried by a 
population of neurons rather than on the specific output of 
one or a few cells that are selective for a particular object. 
The Frontal Association Cortex 
Mediates Planning and 
Decision Making 
The functional deficits that result from damage to the hu- 
man frontal lobe are diverse and devastating, particularly if 
both hemispheres are involved. This broad range of clinical 
effects stems from the fact that the frontal cortex has a wider 
repertoire of functions than any other neocortical region 
(consistent with the fact that the frontal lobes in humans 
and other primates are the largest of the brain's lobes and 
comprise a greater number of cytoarchitectonic areas). 
The particularly devastating nature of the behavioral def- 
icits after frontal lobe damage reflects the role of this part 
of the brain in maintaining what is normally thought of as 
an individual's "personality." The frontal cortex integrates 
complex information from sensory and motor cortices, as 
well as from the parietal and temporal association cortices.

_ Long before PET scanning and func- 
_ tional MRI were available to evaluate 
' normal and abnormal cognitive brain 
- function, several "low-tech" methods 
_ provided reliable means of assessing 
_ these operations in human subjects. 
_ From the late 1940s onward, psycholo- 
_ gists and neurologists developed a bat- 
_ tery of behavioral tests—generally 
_ called neuropsychological tests—to 
evaluate the integrity of cognitive func- 
tion and to help localize lesions. 
One of the most frequently used 
| measures is the Wisconsin Card Sorting 
Task illustrated here. In this test, the 
_ examiner places four cards with symbols 
_ 
that differ in number, shape, or color 
before the subject, who is given a set of 
_ response cards with similar symbols on 
_ them. The subject is then asked to place 
an appropriate response card in front 
of the stimulus card based on a sort- 
ing rule established, but not stated, by 
the examiner (i.e., sort by either color, 
_ number, or shape). The examiner then 
indicates whether the response is "right" 
or "wrong." After 10 consecutive correct 
responses, the examiner changes the 
sorting rule simply by saying "wrong." 
The subject must then ascertain the new 
sorting rule and perform 10 correct trials. 
The sorting rule is then changed again, 
until 6 cycles have been completed. 
In 1963, the neuropsycholo- 
gist Brenda Milner at the Montreal 
Neurological Institute showed that 
jig) 
patients with frontal lobe lesions 
have consistently poor performance 
in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. 
By comparing patients with known 
brain lesions as a result of surgery for 
epilepsy or tumor, Milner was able 
to demonstrate that this impairment 
is fairly specific for frontal lobe dam- 
age. Particularly striking is the inability 
of frontal lobe patients to use previ- 
ous information to guide subsequent 
behavior. A widely accepted explana- 
tion for the sensitivity of the Wisconsin 
Card Sorting Task to frontal lobe defi- 
cits is the "planning" aspect of this test. 
To respond correctly, the subject must 
retain information about the previ- 
ous trial, which is then used to guide 
behavior on future trials. Processing this 
sort of information is characteristic of 
normal frontal lobe function. In keeping 
with the conservation of neural func- 
tion between humans and non-human 
primates, rhesus monkeys can also be 
taught to perform a computerized vari- 
ant of the Wisconsin Card Sort Task. 
Lesion studies in monkeys confirm that 
the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex is 
crucial for performing this task, specifi- 
cally for representing the rule (i.e., sort 
by shape, color, or number). Single-unit 
recordings in monkeys showing neu- 
rons whose activity specifically encodes 
particular rules endorse this conclusion.

cal tests have been devised to evaluate

the functional integrity of other cogni- 
tive functions. These include tasks in 
which a patient is asked to identify 
familiar faces in a series of pictures, and 
others in which "distractors" interfere 
with the patient's ability to attend to 
salient stimulus features. An example 
of the latter is the Stroop Test, in which 
patients are asked to read the names 
of colors presented in color-conflicting 
print (for example, the word green 
printed in red ink). This sort of chal- 
lenge evaluates abilities related to both 
attention and identification. 
The simplicity, economy, and accu- 
mulated experience with such tests con-

The result is an appreciation of self in relation to the world 
that allows behaviors to be planned and executed normally. 
When this ability is compromised, the afflicted individual 
often has difficulty carrying out complex behaviors that are 
appropriate to the circumstances. These deficiencies in the 
normal ability to match ongoing behavior to present or fu- 
ture demands are, not surprisingly, interpreted as a change 
in the patient's "character." 
The case that first called attention to the consequences 
of frontal lobe damage was that of Phineas Gage, a laborer 
on the Rutland and Burlington Railroad in mid-nineteenth 
century Vermont. In that era, the conventional method of 
blasting rock involved tamping powder into a hole with a 
heavy metal rod. Gage, a popular and respected crew fore- 
man, was undertaking this procedure one day in 1848 when 
his tamping rod sparked the powder, setting off an explo- 
sion that drove the rod—which was about 1 meter long 
and 4 or 5 centimeters in diameter—through his left orbit 
(eye socket), destroying much of the frontal part of his brain 
in the process. Gage, who never lost consciousness, was 
promptly taken to a local doctor who treated his wound. An 
infection set in, presumably destroying additional frontal 
lobe tissue, and Gage was an invalid for several months. 
Eventually, he recovered and was to outward appearances 
well again. Those who knew Gage, however, were pro- 
foundly aware that he was not the "same" individual that 
he had been before. A temperate, hardworking, and alto- 
gether decent person had, by virtue of this accident, been 
turned into an inconsiderate, intemperate lout who could 
no longer cope with normal social intercourse or the kind 
of practical planning that had allowed Gage the social and 
economic success he enjoyed before. 
The physician who looked after Gage until his death in 
1863 summarized his impressions of Gage's personality as 
follows: 
[Gage is] fitful, irreverent, indulging at times in the 
erossest profanity (which was not previously his custom), 
manifesting but little deference for his fellows, impatient 
of restraint or advice when it conflicts with his desires, at 
times pertinaciously obstinate, yet capricious and vacil- 
lating, devising many plans of future operations, which 
are no sooner arranged than they are abandoned in turn 
for others appearing more feasible. A child in his intel- 
lectual capacity and manifestations, he has the animal 
passions of a strong man. Previous to his injury, although 
untrained in the schools, he possessed a well-balanced 
mind, and was looked upon by those who knew him as a 
shrewd, smart businessman, very energetic and persistent 
in executing all his plans of operation. In this regard his 
mind was radically changed, so decidedly that his friends 
and acquaintances said he was 'no longer Gage.'

Massachusetts Medical Society 2: 339-340)

Another classic case of frontal lobe deficits was that of 
a patient followed throughout the 1920s and 1930s by the 
neurologist R. M. Brickner. Joe A., as Brickner referred to 
his patient, was a stockbroker who at age 39 underwent 
bilateral frontal lobe resection to remove a large tumor. 
After the operation, Joe A. had no obvious sensory or 
motor deficits—he could speak and understand verbal 
communication and was aware of people, objects, and 
temporal order in his environment. He acknowledged his 
illness and retained a high degree of intellectual power, 
as judged from an ongoing ability to play an expert game 
of checkers. Nonetheless, Joe A.'s personality underwent 
a dramatic change. This formerly restrained, modest man 
became boastful of professional, physical, and sexual 
prowess, showed little restraint in conversation, and was 
unable to match the appropriateness of what he said to 
his audience. Like Gage, his ability to plan for the future 
was largely lost, as were much of his earlier initiative and 
creativity. Even though he retained the ability to learn 
complex procedures, he was unable to return to work and 
had to rely on his family for support and care. 
The effects of widespread frontal lobe damage docu- 
' mented by these case studies encompass a wide range of 
cognitive disabilities, including impaired restraint, dis- 
ordered thought, perseveration (repetition of the same 
behavior), and the inability to plan appropriate action. 
Recent studies of patients with focal damage to particular 
regions of the frontal lobe suggest that some of the pro- 
cesses underlying these deficits may be localized. Work- 
ing memory functions (see Chapter 31) are situated more 
dorsolaterally, and planning and social restraint functions 
are located more ventromedially. Some of these functions 
can be clinically assessed using standardized tests such as 
the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task for planning (Box 26B), 
the delayed response task for working memory, and the 
"go-nogo" task for inhibition of inappropriate responses. 
All these observations are consistent with the idea that 
the common denominator of the cognitive functions sub- 
served by the frontal cortex is the selection, planning, and 
execution of appropriate behavior, particularly in social 
contexts. 
More recent brain imaging studies have confirmed the 
important role of the frontal association cortex in plan- 
ning, decision making, and behavioral inhibition; these 
studies corroborate the allocation of these functions to 
specific areas of the frontal lobes hinted at by studies 
of brain-damaged patients. For example, the dorsal and 
lateral aspects of the frontal cortex are activated when 
normal subjects actively suppress a behavioral response 
when an expected pattern of events is violated in order to 
generate the appropriate behavior (Figure 26.15). These 
findings endorse a role for this part of the brain in main- 
taining information in working memory (see Chapter 31) 
and using that information to override automatic reactions

to anticipated events. By contrast, individual preferences 
for different types of rewards are correlated with individ- 
ual differences in brain activation within the ventromedial 
prefrontal cortex, suggesting this part of the brain signals 
the value individuals place on a reward independent of its 
physical attributes (Figure 26.16). Such signals are crucial 
for making adaptive decisions, and the effects of disrupted 
reward processing in ventromedial prefrontal cortex on 
decision making are all too apparent in the disordered 
behavior of patients (such as Phineas Gage) with damage 
to this area. 
Sadly, the effects of damage to the frontal lobes have 
also been documented by the many thousands of frontal 
lobotomies ("leukotomies") performed in the 1930s and 
1940s as a means of treating mental illness (Box 26C). The 
rise and fall of the popularity of this "psychosurgery" pro- 
vides a compelling example of the frailty of human judg- 
ment in medical practice and of the conflicting approaches 
of neurologists, neurosurgeons, and psychiatrists in that era 
to the treatment of mental disease.

"Planning Neurons" in the 
Monkey Frontal Cortex 
In confirmation of the clinical evidence about the function of 
the frontal association cortices in neurological patients, neu- 
rons that appear to be specifically involved in planning have 
been identified in the frontal cortices of rhesus monkeys. 
One behavioral test used to study cells in the monkey 
frontal cortex is called the delayed response task (Figure 
26.17A). Variants of this task are used to assess frontal lobe 
function in a variety of situations, including the clinical 
evaluation of frontal lobe function in humans (see Box 26B). 
In the simplest version of the delayed response task, the 
monkey watches an experimenter place a food morsel in one 
of two wells; both wells are then covered. Subsequently, a 
screen is lowered for an interval of a few seconds to several 
minutes (the delay). When the screen is raised, the monkey 
gets only one chance to uncover the well containing food 
and retrieve the reward. Thus, the animal must decide that 
he wants the food, remember where it is placed, recall that 
the cover must be removed to obtain the food, and keep all 
this information available during the delay so that it can be 
used to get the reward. The monkey's ability to carry out this 
working memory task is diminished or abolished if the area 
anterior to the motor region of the frontal cortex—called the 
prefrontal cortex—is destroyed bilaterally; this result is in 
accord with clinical findings in human patients.

Some neurons in the prefrontal cortex, particularly those 
in and around the principal sulcus (Figure 26.17B), are acti- 
vated when monkeys perform computerized variants of the 
delayed response task, and they are maximally active during 
the period of the delay, as if their firing represented informa- 
tion about the location of the food morsel maintained from 
the presentation part of the trial (i.e., the cognitive informa- 
tion needed to guide behavior when the screen is raised; 
Figure 26.17C,D). Such neurons return to a low level of 
activity during the actual motor phase of the task, suggest- 
ing that they represent working memory and planning (see 
Chapter 31) rather than the actual movement itself. Delay- 
specific neurons in the prefrontal cortex are also active in 
monkeys that have been trained to perform a variant of the 
delayed response task in which well-learned movements are

a level of 90% correct after fewer than 500 
training trials, whereas monkeys with frontal 
lesions perform poorly. (B) Region of record-

Response 
produced in the absence of any cue. Evidently, these neu- 
rons are equally capable of using stored information to guide 
behavior. Thus, if a monkey is trained to associate looking 
at a particular target with a delayed reward, the delay-asso- 
ciated neurons in the prefrontal cortex will fire during the 
delay, even if the monkey shifts his gaze to the appropriate 
region of the visual field in the absence of the target. 

In addition to maintaining cognitive information during 
short delays, some neurons in prefrontal cortex also appear 
to participate directly in longer range planning of sequences 
of movements. When monkeys are trained to perform a 
motor sequence, such as turning a joystick to the left, then 
right, then left again, some neurons in prefrontal cortex fire 
at a particular point in the sequence (such as the third re- 
sponse), regardless of which movement (e.g., left or right) is 
made. Prefrontal neurons have also been found that are se- 
lective for each position in a learned motor sequence, thus 
ruling out the possibility that these neurons merely encode 
task difficulty or proximity to reward as the monkey nears 
the end of the series of responses. When these regions of 
prefrontal cortex are inactivated pharmacologically, mon- 
keys lose the ability to execute sequences of movements 
from memory. These observations endorse the notion, first 
inferred from studies of brain-damaged individuals like 
Phineas Gage, that the frontal lobe contributes specifically 
to the cognitive functions that use stored information to 
plan and guide appropriate sequences of behavior. 
Summary 
The majority of the human cerebral cortex is devoted to 
tasks that transcend encoding primary sensations or 
commanding motor actions. Collectively, the association 
cortices mediate these cognitive functions of the brain— 
broadly defined as the ability to attend to, identify, and act 
meaningfully in response to complex external or internal 
stimuli. Descriptions of patients with cortical lesions, func- 
tional brain imaging of normal subjects, and behavioral and 
electrophysiological studies of non-human primates have 
established the general purpose of the major association 
areas. Thus, parietal association cortex is involved in atten- 
tion and awareness of the body and the stimuli that act on 
it; temporal association cortex is involved in the recognition 
and identification of highly processed sensory information; 
and frontal association cortex is importantly involved in 
guiding complex behavior by planning responses to ongo- 
ing stimulation (or remembered information), matching 
such behaviors to the demands of a particular situation. 
The especially extensive association areas in our species 
compared to those of other primates support the cognitive 
processes that define human culture. Nonetheless, func- 
tional localization, whether inferred by examining human 
patients or by recording single neurons in monkeys, is an 
imprecise business. The observations summarized here are 
merely a rudimentary guide to thinking about how com- 
plex cognitive information is represented and processed in 
the brain, as well as how the relevant brain areas and their 
constituent neurons contribute to such important but still 
ill-defined qualities as personality, intelligence, and other 
cognitive functions that define what it means to be human.

Overview 
ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE CORTICAL FUNCTIONS in humans is the 
ability to associate arbitrary symbols with specific meanings to express thoughts and 
emotions to ourselves and others by means of language, whether in thought, speech, 
or writing. The achievements of human culture rest largely on this kind of com- 
munication, and a person who for one reason or another fails to develop a facility 
for language as a child is severely incapacitated. Studies of patients with damage to 
specific cortical regions and of normal subjects indicate that the linguistic abilities of 
humans depend on the integrity of a number of specialized areas located primarily in 
the association cortices of the temporal and frontal lobes. Understanding functional 
localization and hemispheric lateralization of language is especially important in 
clinical practice. The need to map a patient's language functions for the purpose of 
sparing those cortical areas involved in its comprehension and production has pro- 
vided a rich store of information about the neural organization of this critical human 
attribute. In the vast majority of people, the primary functions for explicitly semantic 
processing are located in the left hemisphere: the links between speech sounds and 
their meanings are mainly represented in the left temporal cortex, and the circuitry 
for the motor commands that organize meaningful speech production is mainly in 
the left frontal cortex. Despite this left-sided predominance of the lexical, grammati- 
cal, and syntactical aspects of language, the emotional (affective) content of speech 
is governed largely by the right hemisphere. Studies of congenitally deaf individuals 
have shown that the cortical areas devoted to sign language are generally the same as 
those that organize spoken and heard communication, suggesting that the regions of 
the brain devoted to language are specialized for symbolic representation and com- 
munication rather than for heard and spoken language as such. A variety of evidence 
indicates that the neural antecedents for some aspects of these abilities are present 
in some non-human animal species. 
Language Is Localized and Lateralized in the Brain 
It has been known for more than a century that two regions in the frontal and tempo- 
ral association cortices of the left cerebral hemisphere are especially important for the

nineteenth century (Figure B). 
Although the physiological details 
are complex, the general operation 
of the vocal apparatus is simple. Air 
expelled from the lungs accelerates as 
it passes through a constricted open- 
ing between the vocal folds called the 
glottis, thus decreasing the pressure in 
the air stream according to Bernoulli's 
principle. As a result, the vocal folds 
come together until the pressure build- 
up in the lungs forces them open again. 
The ongoing iteration of this process 
results in an oscillation of sound wave 
pressure, the frequency of which is 
determined primarily by the muscles

that control the tension on the vocal 
cords. The fundamental frequency of 
these oscillations (the first harmonic)— 
which are the basis of the power in 
voiced speech sounds—ranges from 
about 100 to about 400 Hz, depend- 
ing on the gender, size, and age of the 
speaker. 
The larynx has many other conse- 
quential effects on the speech signal, 
and these create additional speech 
sounds. For instance, the vocal folds 
can open suddenly to produce what 
is called a glottal stop (as in the begin- 
ning of the exclamation "Idiot!"). 
Alternatively, the vocal folds can hold 
an intermediate position for the pro- 
duction of consonants such as h, or they 
can be completely open for "unvoiced" 
consonants such as s or f (i.e., speech 
sounds that don't have the periodic 
quality derived from vocal fold oscil- 
lations). In short, the larynx is impor- 
tant in the production of virtually all 
vocalizations. 
The vocal system as a whole can be 
thought of as a sort of musical instru- 
ment capable of exquisite modulation. 
- 
As in the sound produced by a musi- 
cal instrument, however, the primary 
source of oscillation (e.g., the reed of 
a clarinet or the vocal folds in speech) 
is hardly the whole story. The entire

pathway between the vocal folds and 
the lips (and nostrils) is equally criti- 
cal in determining speech sounds, as is 
the structure of a musical instrument. 
The most important determinants 
of the sound that emanates from an 
instrument are its natural resonances, 
which shape or filter the sound pres- 
sure oscillation. For the vocal tract, 
the natural resonances that modulate 
the air stream generated by the larynx 
are called formants. Formants are thus 
peaks of power in the spectrum of a 
vocal sound stimulus (see Figure B). 
The power in the laryngeal source near 
the formant frequencies will be rein- 
forced, and power at other frequencies 
will, in varying degrees, be filtered out. 
The resonance frequency of the first 
formant arises from the fact that the 
approximate length of the adult vocal 
tract in its relaxed state is about 17 cm, 
which is the quarter wavelength of a 68 
cm sound wave; quarter wavelengths 
determine the resonances of pipes 
open at one end, which essentially 
describes the vocal tract. Since the 
speed of sound is about 33,500 cm/sec, 
the lowest resonance frequency of an 
open tube or pipe of this length will be 
33,500/68, or about 500 Hz; additional 
formants occur at about 1500 Hz and 
2500 Hz. The changing shape of the 
vocal tract during speech changes to 
relative frequencies of the formants, 
thus producing different vowel sounds. 
In any given language, the basic 
speech sounds are called phones and the 
percepts they elicit phonemes; different 
phones are produced as the muscles of 
the vocal tract change the tension on 
the vocal fold and the shape of the res- 
onant cavities above the folds. Phones 
make up syllables in speech, which are 
used in turn to make up words, which 
are then strung together to create sen- 
tences. There are about 40 phonemes 
in English, and these are about equally 
divided between vowel and consonant 
speech sound percepts. As noted, vowel 
sounds are the periodic voiced elements 
of speech generated by the oscillation 
of the vocal cords. In contrast, conso- 
nant sounds involve rapid changes in

In English, consonants begin and/or 
end syllables, each of which entails a 
vowel sound. Consonant sounds are 
explicitly verbal aspects of human language. That language 
abilities are both localized and lateralized is not surpris- 
ing; ample evidence of the localization and lateralization 
of other cognitive functions was reviewed in Chapter 26.

(B) The source-filter model of speech produc- 
tion. Air expelled by the lungs causes the vocal 
folds to vibrate, which if recorded at this posi- 
tion in the vocal tract shows a uniformly dec- 
rementing harmonic series. The supralaryngeal 
structures of the vocal tract alter (filter) these 
"laryngeal harmonics" by superimposing their 
own harmonic resonance values at around 
500, 1500, and 2500 Hz. The result determines 
the relative positions of the peaks in the laryn- 
geal harmonics (formants) and thus the sound 
stimulus that is uttered. (After Miller, 1991.) 
categorized according to the site in the 
vocal tract that determines them (the 
place of articulation) and the physical 
way in which they are generated (the 
manner of articulation). With respect to 
place, there are labial consonants (such 
as p and b), dental consonants 
SPEECH AND LANGUAGE 
609 
(f and v), palatal consonants (sh), and 
glottal consonants (h) (among many 
others). With respect to manner, there 
are plosive, fricative, nasal, liquid, and 
semi-vowel consonants. Plosives are 
produced by blocking the flow of air 
somewhere in the vocal tract, fricatives 
by producing turbulence, nasals by 
directing the flow of air through the 
nose, and so on. A further variation on 
the use of consonants is found in the 
"click languages" of southern Africa, 
of which about 30 survive today. Each 
of these languages has 4-5 different 
click sounds that are double conso- 
nants made by sucking the tongue 
down from the roof of the mouth. 
It should be obvious by now that 
speech sound stimuli are enormously 
complex (there are more than different 
200 phonemes in the approximately 
6000 human languages in the world 
today). To complicate matters further, 
there is no simple correspondence 
between phonemes and the elements 
in speech. Because the shape of the 
vocal tract changes continuously in 
normal speech, one phoneme overlaps 
with the next, precluding any split 
into discrete segments, as the abstract 
concept of phones and phonemes 
implies. Given these facts, our ability 
to produce and comprehend speech is 
truly amazing.

recognizing different categories of objects, it is in language 
that this idea has been most thoroughly documented. Be- 
cause language is so important to humans, its lateralization 
has given rise to the misleading idea that one hemisphere 
is actually "dominant" over the other—namely, the hemi- 
sphere in which the major capacity for verbal expression 
resides. But the true significance of lateralization for lan- 
guage (or any other cognitive ability) lies in the efficient 
subdivision of complex functions between the hemispheres 
rather than in any superiority of one hemisphere over the 
other. Indeed, popular dogma about cortical redundancy 
notwithstanding, it is safe to presume that every region of 
the brain is being used efficiently for something important. 
A first step in sorting out the organization of language in 
the brain is to recognize that the representation of language 
is distinct from, although related to, the circuitry concerned 
with the motor planning and control of the larynx, pharynx, 
mouth, and tongue—the structures that produce speech 
sounds (Box 27A). The cortical representation of language 
is also distinct from, although clearly related to, the circuits 
underlying the auditory perception of spoken words and the 
visual perception of written words in the primary auditory 
and visual cortices, respectively (Figure 27.1). Whereas the 
neural substrates for language depend on sensory and mo- 
tor functions, the regions of the brain specifically devoted 
to language transcend these more basic elements. The main 
concern of the cortical areas that represent language is using 
symbols for communication—spoken and heard, written and 
read, or (in the case of sign language) gestured and seen. 
Thus, the essential function of the cortical language areas, 
and indeed of language, is symbolic representation. Obedience 
to a set of rules for using these symbols (called grammar), 
ordering symbols to generate useful meanings (called syn- 
tax), and providing appropriate emotional valence by varying 
intensity, rhythm, and pitch (called prosody) are all important 
and readily recognized elements of communication, regard- 
less of the particular mode of expression. 
Given the profound biological and social importance of 
communication among the members of a species, it is not 
surprising that other animals communicate in ways that, 
while grossly impoverished compared to human language, 
nonetheless suggest the sorts of communication skills and 
interactions from which human language evolved in the 
brains of our hominid and prehominid ancestors (Box 27B). 
Aphasias 
The distinction between language and the related sensory 
and motor functions on which it depends was first apparent 
in patients with damage to specific brain regions. Clinical 
evidence from such cases showed that the ability to move 
the muscles of the larynx, pharynx, mouth, and tongue can 
be compromised without abolishing the ability to use lan- 
guage to communicate (even though a motor deficit may

make communication difficult). Similarly, damage to the 
auditory pathways can impede the ability to hear without 
interfering with language functions per se (as is obvious 
in individuals who have become partially or wholly deaf 
later in life). Damage to specific brain regions, however, 
can compromise essential language functions while leav- 
ing the sensory and motor infrastructure of verbal com- 
munication intact. These syndromes, collectively referred 
to as aphasias (from Greek, meaning "without utterance"), 
diminish or abolish the ability to comprehend and/or to 
produce language as a vehicle for communicating mean- 
ingful statements, while sparing the ability to perceive the 
relevant stimuli and to produce intelligible words. Missing 
in these patients is the capacity to recognize or employ the 
symbolic value of words correctly, thus depriving such in- 
dividuals of the linguistic understanding, grammatical and 
syntactical organization, and/or appropriate intonation that 
distinguishes language from nonsense (Box 27C). 
The first evidence for the localization of language func- 
tion to a specific region (and to a hemisphere) of the cere- 
brum is usually attributed to the French neurologist Paul 
Broca and the German neurologist Carl Wernicke, who 
made a variety of seminal observations in the late 1800s. 
Both Broca and Wernicke examined the brains of individu- 
als who had become aphasic and later died. Based on cor- 
relations of the clinical picture and the location of the brain 
damage seen in autopsy, Broca suggested that language 
abilities were localized in the ventroposterior region of the 
frontal lobe (Figure 27.2; see also Figure 27.1). More impor- 
tantly, he observed that the loss of the ability to produce 
meaningful language—as opposed to the loss of the ability 
to move the mouth and produce words—was usually as- 
sociated with damage to the left hemisphere. Thus Broca

concluded that "On parle avec l'hemisphere gauche" ("We 
speak with our left brain"). The preponderance of aphasic 
syndromes associated with damage to the left hemisphere 
has supported his claim that the left hemisphere is the 
primary site for the production of meaningful language, a 
conclusion amply confirmed by a variety of modern studies

Although Broca was basically correct, he failed to grasp 
the limitations of thinking about language as a unitary 
function localized in a single cortical region. This issue 
was better appreciated by Wernicke, who distinguished 
BOX 27B Do Other Animals Have Language? 
Over the centuries, theologians, natu- 
ral philosophers, and a good many 
modern neuroscientists have argued 
that language is uniquely human, this 
extraordinary behavior being seen as 
setting us qualitatively apart from our 
fellow animals. However, the gradual 
75 years demonstrating highly sophis- 
ticated systems of communication in 
species as diverse as bees, birds, mon- 
keys, and whales has made this point of 
view increasingly untenable, at least in 
a broad sense. Until recently, however, 
human language has appeared unique in 
the ability to associate specific meanings 
with arbitrary symbols, ad infinitum. In 
the dance of the honeybee described 
so beautifully by Karl von Frisch, for 
example, all the symbolic movements 
made by a foraging bee that returns to 
the hive encode only a single meaning; 
expression and appreciation has been 
hardwired into the nervous systems of 
the actor and the respondents. 
A series of controversial stud- 
ies in great apes, however, have 
claimed that the rudiments of human

in the behavior of our closest relatives. 
While techniques have varied, most 
psychologists who study chimps have 
used some form of manipulable sym- 
bols that can be arranged to express 
ideas in an interpretable manner. For 
accumulation of evidence during the last 
example, chimps can be trained to 
manipulate tiles or other symbols (such _—_ (Figure A). With appropriate training, 
as the gestures of sign language) to rep- 
resent words and syntactical constructs, 
allowing them to communicate simple 
demands, questions, and even sponta- 
neous expressions. The most remark- 
able results have come from increasing-

enough. Ethologists studying chimpan-

gestures, the manipulation of objects,

studies of monkeys have shown that 
some species normally use a variety 
of vocalizations in socially meaning-

represent the antecedents of human

end, it may turn out to be that human 
language, for all its complexity, is based 
on the same general scheme of inher- 
ent and acquired neural associations 
between tokens and meanings that 
appears to be the basis of any animal

When Samuel Johnson (Figure A) 
compiled his Dictionary of English 
Language in 1755 under the sponsor- 
ship of Oxford University, he defined 
only 43,500 entries. The current Oxford 
English Dictionary, a lineal descendant 
of Johnson's seminal work and most 
_ recently revised in the 1980s, contains 
over 500,000 definitions. This quan- 
_ titative difference is not the result of 
_ 
an increase in the number of English 
_ words since the eighteenth century but 
_ rather is an indication of the difficulty 
_ the average educated speaker of English 
of collecting the enormous number of 
words we use in daily communication; 
is said to have a working vocabulary of 
about 10,000 words and may know as 
many as 100,000. 
Using words appropriately is made 
even more difficult by the fact that 
word meanings are continually chang- 
ing and by the enormous ambiguity 
of the words we do use. There is far 
more to a lexicon—be it a dictionary 
or a region of the left temporal cor- 
tex—than simply attaching meanings 
to words. Even when the meaning of a 
word is known, it must be understood 
in a particular context (Figure B) and 
used according to the rules of grammar 
and syntax in order to produce effective 
communication. 
From the points of view of both neu- 
roscience and linguistics, two related 
questions about words and gram- 
mar (i.e., the rules for putting words 
together) are especially germane in 
relation to this chapter. First, what is 
the nature of the neural machinery 
(A) Samuel Johnson 
BOX 27C Words and Meaning 
(B) 
SPEECH AND LANGUAGE 
613 
(B) The importance of context. When a person says "I'm going to our house on 
the lake," the meaning of the expression depends on usage and context rather 
than on the literal structure of the sentence uttered. This example indicates the 
daunting complexity of the kind of linguistic task we all accomplish routinely. 
(After Miller, 1991.) 
that allows us to learn language? And 
second, why do humans have such a 
profound drive to learn language? The 
major twentieth-century figure who has 
grappled with these questions is lin- 
guist Noam Chomsky, working at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
Chomsky, while not interested in brain 
structure, argued that the complexity 
of language is such that it cannot sim- 
ply be learned. He therefore proposed 
that language must be predicated on a 
"universal grammar" laid down in the 
evolution of our species. 
Although this argument is undoubt- 
edly correct in one sense (the basic 
neural machinery for language, like all 
aspects of brain circuitry that support 
adult behavior, is indeed constructed 
during the normal development of 
each individual, primarily as a result of 
inheritance; see Chapters 23 and 24), 
Chomsky's eschewing of neurobiology 
avoids the central question of how, in 
evolutionary or developmental terms, 
this machinery comes to be and how 
it encodes words and strings them 
together into meaningful sentences. 
Whatever the mechanisms eventually 
prove to be, much of the language 
we use is obviously learned by mak- 
ing associations between neurons 
that respond to arbitrary symbols and 
neurons whose activity is capable of 
representing the objects, concepts, and 
interrelationships they signify in the 
real world. As such, human language 
provides a rich source for understand- 
ing how the relevant parts of the 
human cortex and their constituent 
neurons produce the enormous range 
of associations that underlie many cor- 
tical functions.

CHAPTER 27 
between patients who had lost the ability to comprehend 
language and those who could no longer produce language. 
Wernicke recognized that some aphasic patients retain the 
ability to produce utterances with reasonable grammatical 
and syntactical fluency, but without meaningful content. 
He concluded that lesions of the posterior and superior 
temporal lobe on the left side tend to result in deficits of 
this sort. In contrast, other patients continue to compre- 
hend language but lack the ability to organize or control 
the content of their speech, even though it is clear that 
they know what they are trying to say. Thus, they repeat 
syllables and words, utter grammatically incomprehensible 
phrases, and repeat phrases—even though their meaning 
eventually gets through (see the examples below). These 
deficits are associated with damage to the posterior and 
inferior region of the left frontal lobe, the area that Broca 
emphasized as an important substrate for language (see 
Figures 27.1 and 27.2). 
As a consequence of these early observations, two rules 
about the localization of language are commonly taught. 
The first is that lesions of the left frontal lobe in a region 
referred to as Breca's area affect the ability to produce lan- 
guage efficiently. This deficiency, called motor or expres- 
sive aphasia, is also known as Broca's aphasia. (Such 
aphasias must be specifically distinguished from dysarthria, 
which is the inability to properly move the muscles of the 
mouth, tongue, and pharynx that mediate speaking.) The 
deficient motor-planning aspects of expressive aphasias 
accord with the complex motor functions of the posterior 
frontal lobe and its proximity to the primary motor cortex 
already discussed (see Chapters 16 and 26). 
The second rule is that damage to the left temporal lobe 
causes difficulty understanding spoken language, a defi- 
ciency referred to as sensory or receptive aphasia, also 
known as Wernicke's aphasia. (Deficits of reading and 
writing—alexias and agraphias—are separate disorders that 
can arise from damage to related but different brain areas; 
most aphasics, however, also have difficulty with these 
closely linked abilities.) Receptive aphasia generally reflects 
damage to the auditory association cortices in the posterior 
temporal lobe, a region referred to as Wernicke's area. 
A final broad category of language deficiency syndromes 
is conduction aphasia. These disorders arise from lesions 
to the pathways connecting the relevant temporal and fron- 
tal regions, such as the arcuate fasciculus in the subcorti- 
cal white matter that links Broca's and Wernicke's areas. 
Interruption of these pathways may result in an inability to 
produce appropriate responses to heard communication, 
even though the communication is understood. 
In a classic Broca's aphasia, the patient cannot express 
himself fluently because the organizational aspects of lan- 
guage (i.e., its grammar and syntax) have been disrupted, as 
shown in the following example reported by Howard Gard- 
ner (who is the interlocutor). The patient was a 39-year-old

I interjected. 'You were a signal...' "A sig-nal man...

you in the Coast Guard?' 'No, er, yes, yes, ...ship...Mas-

hands twice, indicating the number nineteen. 'Oh, you 
were in the Coast Guard for nineteen years.' 'Oh...boy...

Mr. Ford?' Ford looked at me strangely, as if to say, Isn't 
it patently obvious? He pointed to his paralyzed arm 
and said, 'Arm no good,' then to his mouth and said, 
'Speech...can't say...talk, you see.'

In contrast, the major difficulty in Wernicke's aphasia is 
putting together objects or ideas and the words that signify 
them. Thus, in a Wernicke's aphasia, speech is fluent and 
well structured, but makes little or no sense because words 
and meanings are not correctly linked, as is apparent in the 
following example (again from Gardner). The patient in this 
case was a 72-year-old retired butcher who had suffered a 
stroke affecting his left posterior temporal lobe.

The major differences between these two classical aphasias 
are summarized in Table 27.1. 
Despite the validity of Broca's and Wernicke's original 
observations, in practice the classification of language dis- 
orders is considerably more complex. An effort to refine the 
categorization of aphasias was undertaken by the American 
neurologist Norman Geschwind during the 1950s and early 
1960s. Based on clinical and anatomical data from a large 
number of patients and on the better understanding of cor- 
tical connectivity gleaned from animal studies, Geschwind 
concluded correctly that several other regions of the parietal,

temporal, and frontal cortices are critically involved in hu- 
man linguistic capacities. Basically, he showed that damage 
to these additional areas results in identifiable, if more sub- 
tle, language deficits. His clarification of the definitions of 
language disorders has been largely confirmed by functional 
brain imaging in normal subjects and remains the basis for 
much contemporary work on language and aphasias. 
Confirmation of Language 
Lateralization and Other Insights 
Until the 1960s, observations about language localization 
and lateralization were based primarily on patients with 
brain lesions of varying severity, location, and etiology. Up 
until that time, the inevitable uncertainties of clinical findings 
had allowed some skeptics to argue that language and other 
complex cognitive functions might not be localized or even 
lateralized in the brain. Definitive evidence supporting the 
inferences from neurological observations came from studies 
of patients whose corpus callosum and anterior commissure 
were severed as a treatment for medically intractable epilep- 
tic seizures. (Recall that a fraction of severe epileptics are re- 
fractory to medical treatment, and that interrupting the con- 
nection between the two hemispheres remains an effective 
way of treating epilepsy in highly selected patients; see Box 
8C). In such patients, investigators could assess the function 
of the two cerebral hemispheres independently, because the 
major axon tracts that connect them had been interrupted. 
Roger Sperry and his colleagues at the California Institute 
of Technology carried out the first studies of these so-called 
split-brain patients in the 1960s and 1970s, establishing the 
hemispheric lateralization of language beyond any doubt. 
Their work also demonstrated many other functional dif- 
ferences between the left and right hemispheres and stands 
today as an extraordinary contribution to the understanding 
of brain organization. 
To evaluate the functional capacity of each hemisphere in 
split-brain patients, it is essential to provide information to 
one side of the brain only. Sperry, Michael Gazzaniga (a key 
collaborator in this work), and others devised several simple 
ways to do this, the most straightforward of which was to 
ask the subject to use each hand independently to identify 
SPEECH AND LANGUAGE 
615 
objects without any visual assistance (Figure 27.3A). Recall 
from Chapter 9 that somatic sensory information from the 
right hand is processed by the left hemisphere, and vice 
versa. Therefore, by asking the subject to describe an item 
being manipulated by one hand or the other, the language 
capacity of the relevant hemisphere could be tested. Such 
studies showed clearly that the two hemispheres differ in 
their language ability, in keeping with the post mortem cor- 
relations described earlier. 
Using the left hemisphere, split-brain patients were able 
to name objects held in the right hand without difficulty. 
In contrast, and quite remarkably, an object held in the left 
hand could not be named. Using the right hemisphere, 
most split-brain patients could produce only an indirect 
description that relied on rudimentary words and phrases 
rather than the precise lexical symbol for the object (for in- 
stance, "a round thing" instead of "a ball"); some could 
not provide any verbal account of what they held in their 
left hand. Observations using techniques to present visual 
information to the hemispheres independently (a method 
called tachistoscopic presentation; Figure 27.3B) showed 
further that the left hemisphere responds to written com- 
'mands, whereas the right hemisphere typically responds 
only to nonverbal stimuli (e.g., pictorial instructions or, in 
some cases, rudimentary written commands). These dis- 
tinctions reflect broader hemispheric differences summa- 
rized by the statement that the left hemisphere in most hu- 
mans is specialized for (among other things) the verbal and 
symbolic processing important in communication, whereas 
the right hemisphere is specialized for (among other things) 
visuospatial and emotional processing. 
The ingenious work of Sperry and his colleagues on split- 
brain patients put an end to the century-long controversy 
about language lateralization. In most individuals, the left 
hemisphere is unequivocally the seat of the explicitly verbal 
language functions. There is significant variation in the de- 
eree of lateralization among individuals, however (Box 27D), 
and it would be wrong to suppose that the right hemisphere 
has no language capacity. As noted, in some individuals 
the right hemisphere can produce rudimentary words and 
phrases, a few individuals have fully right-sided verbal func- 
tions, and even for the majority with strongly left-lateralized 
language semantic abilities, the right hemisphere is normally 
the source of our emotional coloring of language (see below 
and Chapter 29). Moreover, the right hemisphere in many 
split-brain patients understands language to a modest de- 
eree, since these patients can respond to simple visual com- 
mands presented tachistoscopically in the left visual field. 
Consequently, Broca's conclusion that "we speak with our 
left brain" is not strictly correct; it would be more accurate to 
say that most people understand language and speak very 
much better with the left hemisphere than with the right, and 
that the contributions of the two hemispheres to the overall 
goals of communication are different.

Confirmation of hemispheric specialization for language. These results were obtained 
by studying individuals in whom the connections between the right and left hemispheres had been surgically 
divided. (A) Single-handed, vision-independent stereognosis can be used to evaluate the language capabili- 
ties of each hemisphere in split-brain patients. Objects held in the right hand, which provides somatic sensory 
information to the left hemisphere, are easily named; objects held in the left hand, however, are not readily 
named by most of these patients. (B) Visual stimuli or simple instructions can also be given independently to 
the right or left hemisphere in normal and split-brain individuals. Since the left visual field is perceived by the 
right hemisphere (and vice versa; see Chapter 12), a briefly presented (tachistoscopic) instruction in the left 
visual field is appreciated only by the right brain (assuming that the individual maintains fixation on a mark in 
the center of the viewing screen). In normal subjects, activation of the right visual cortex leads to hemispheric 
transfer of visual information via the corpus callosum to the left hemisphere. In split-brain patients, informa- 
tion presented to the left visual field cannot reach the left hemisphere, and patients are unable to produce 
a verbal report regarding the stimuli. However, such patients are able to provide a verbal report of stimuli 
presented to the right visual field. A wide range of hemispheric functions can be evaluated using this method, 
even in normal subjects. The list above enumerates some of the different functional abilities of the left and 
right hemispheres, as deduced from a variety of behavioral tests in split-brain patients.

BOX 27D Language and Handedness 
| 
) Approximately 9 out of 10 people are 
_ tight-handed, a proportion that appears 
_ to have been stable over thousands of 
_ years and across all cultures in which 
_ handedness has been examined. In 
_ addition, handedness, or its equivalent, 
is not peculiar to humans; many studies 
have demonstrated paw preference in 
_ animals ranging from mice to monkeys 
that is, at least in some ways, similar to 
human handedness. 
Handedness is usually assessed 
by having individuals answer a series 
of questions about preferred manual 
behaviors, such as "Which hand do you 
use to write?"; "Which hand do you 
use to throw a ball?"; or "Which hand 
do you use to brush your teeth?" Each 
answer is given a value, depending on 
the preference indicated, providing a 
quantitative measure of the inclina- 
tion toward right- or left-handedness. 
Anthropologists have determined the 
incidence of handedness in ancient cul- 
tures by examining artifacts—the shape 
of a flint ax, for example, can indicate 
whether it was made by a right- or 
left-handed individual. Handedness in 
antiquity has also been assessed by not- 
ing the incidence of people in artistic 
representations who are using one hand 
or the other. Based on this evidence, the 
human species appears always to have 
been a primarily right-handed one. 
Whether an individual is right- or 
left-handed has a number of interest- 
ing consequences. As will be obvious 
to left-handers, the world of human 
artifacts is in many respects a right- 
handed one. Implements such as can 
openers, scissors, and power tools 
are constructed for the right-handed 
majority (Figure A). Books and maga- 
zines are designed for right-handers 
(compare turning this page with your 
left and right hands), as are golf clubs 
and guitars. In addition, the challenge 
(A) A simple manual can opener is one 
example of the many common objects 
designed for use by the right-handed 
majority. 
of penmanship is different for left- and 
right-handers by virtue of writing from 
left to right (Figure B). Perhaps as a 
consequence of such biases, the acci- 
dent rate in all categories (work, home, 
sports—even the rate of traffic fatali- 
ties) is higher for left-handers than for 
right-handers. However, there are also 
can be advantages to being left-handed. 
For example, an inordinate number of 
international fencing champions have 
been left-handed. The reason for this 
fact is simply that the majority of any 
individual's opponents will be right- 
handed, so the average fencer, whether 
right- or left-handed, is less practiced at 
parrying thrusts from left-handers. 
Hotly debated over the years have 
been the related questions of whether 
being left-handed is in any sense 
"pathological" and whether being left- 
handed entails a diminished life expec- 
tancy. No one disputes the fact that 
left-handers have been significantly 
underrepresented among the elderly 
(Figure C). These data have come from 
studies of the general population and 
have been supported by information 
gleaned from The Baseball Encyclopedia 
(which gives the longevity and other 
characteristics of a large number of 
healthy left- and right-handers). 
Two explanations of this finding 
have been put forward. Stanley Coren 
and his collaborators at the University 
(A) 
Right-handed

of British Columbia have argued that 
these statistics reflect a higher mortal- 
ity rate among left-handers, partly as a 
result of increased accidents, but also 
because other data show left-hand- 
edness to be associated with a variety 
of pathologies (there is, for instance, 
a higher incidence of left-handedness 
among individuals classified as mentally 
retarded). Coren and others have sug- 
gested that left-handedness may arise 
because of developmental problems in 
the pre- and/or perinatal period. If this 
were shown to be true, then a rationale 
for decreased longevity would have 
been identified that might combine 
with greater proclivity to accidents in a 
right-hander's world. 
An alternative explanation, however, 
is that the diminished number of left- 
handers among the elderly is primarily 
a reflection of sociological factors— 
namely, a greater acceptance of left- 
handed children today compared with 
the first half of the twentieth century. 
In this view, there are fewer older left- 
handers because in earlier generations 
parents, teachers, and other authority 
figures encouraged (and sometimes 
insisted on) right-handedness. The 
weight of the evidence favors this soci- 
ological explanation.

_ long been a source of confusion. It is 
_ unlikely that there is any direct rela- 
_ tionship between language and hand- 
_ edness, despite much speculation to 
the contrary. The most straightforward 
| evidence on this point comes from the 
_ results of the Wada test described in

carried out for clinical purposes indicate 
_ 
that about 97% of humans—includ- 
ing the majority of left-handers—have 
_ 
explicitly verbal language functions in 
the left hemisphere (although it should 
be noted that right hemispheric domi- 
nance for language is more common 
among left-handers). Since most left- 
handers have language function on the 
side of the brain opposite the control of 
two lateralized functions. In all likeli- 
hood, handedness, like language, is first 
and foremost an example of the advan- 
tage of having any specialized function 
in one hemisphere or the other in order 
to maximize "wiring efficiency."

The Search for Anatomical 
Differences between the Right 
and Left Hemispheres 
The differing language functions of the left and right hemi- 
spheres have naturally inspired neurologists and neu- 
ropsychologists to search for some structural correlate of 
behavioral lateralization. One hemispheric difference that 
has received much attention over the years was identified 
in the late 1960s by Norman Geschwind and his colleagues 
at Harvard Medical School, who found an asymmetry in the 
superior aspect of the temporal lobe known as the planum 
temporale (Figure 27.4). This area is significantly larger on 
the left side in about two-thirds of human subjects stud- 
ied post mortem; a similar difference has been reported in 
higher apes, although not in other primates. 
Because the planum temporale is near (although certainly 
not congruent with) the regions of the temporal lobe that 
contain cortical areas essential to language (i.e., Wernicke's 
area and other auditory association areas), it was initially 
suggested that this leftward asymmetry reflected the greater 
involvement of the left hemisphere in language. However, 
these anatomical differences in the two hemispheres of the 
brain, which are recognizable at birth, are unlikely to be an

larger in the left hemisphere of most (but far from all) individuals.

adults at roughly the same magnitude. (C) A magnetic resonance

anatomical correlate of the language lateralization. The fact 
that a detectable planum asymmetry is present in only 67% 
of human brains while the preeminence of language in the 
left hemisphere is evident in 97% of the population argues 
that this association has some other cause. The structural 
correlate of the functional left-right differences in hemi- 
spheric language abilities, if indeed there is one at a gross 
anatomical level, is simply not clear, as is also the case for 
the lateralized hemispheric functions described in Chapter 
26. Lateralized brain functions evidently depend on more

brain-relevant regions. 
Mapping Language Functions 
The pioneering work of Broca, Wernicke, Geschwind, and 
Sperry clearly established differences in hemispheric func- 
tion. Several techniques have since been developed that al- 
low assessment of hemispheric attributes in neurological pa- 
tients with an intact corpus callosum and in normal subjects. 
One method that has long been used to assess language 
lateralization was devised in the 1960s by Juhn Wada at the 
Montreal Neurological Institute. In the so-called Wada test, 
a short-acting anesthetic (e.g., sodium amytal) is injected 
into the patient's left carotid artery; this procedure tran- 
siently "anesthetizes" the left hemisphere and thus tests 
the functional capabilities of the affected half of the brain. 
If the left hemisphere is indeed "dominant" for language, 
then the patient becomes transiently aphasic while carrying 
out an ongoing verbal task such as counting. The anesthetic 
is rapidly diluted by the circulation, but not before its local 
effects on the hemisphere on the side of the injection can 
be observed. Because this test is potentially dangerous, its 
use is typically limited to neurological patients in whom a 
surgical procedure is contemplated. The Wada test shows 
which hemisphere is "eloquent": although most individuals 

620 
CHAPTER 27 
have the major language functions in the left hemisphere, 
a few—about 3% of the population—do not (the latter are 
much more likely to be left-handed; see Box 27D). 
Less invasive (but also less definitive) ways to test the 
cognitive abilities of the two hemispheres in normal sub- 
jects include positron emission tomography, functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (see Box 1B), transcranial 
magnetic stimulation, and the sort of tachistoscopic presen- 
tation used so effectively by Sperry and his colleagues (even 
when the hemispheres are normally connected, subjects 
show delayed verbal responses and other differences when 
the right hemisphere receives the instruction). Application 
of these noninvasive approaches has amply confirmed the 
hemispheric lateralization of language functions, and im- 
provements in these techniques will eventually allow them 
to replace carotid injection. 
Having determined the hemisphere that is primary for 
language, neurosurgeons may further refine their approach 
to the problem at hand by using electrical stimulation of 
the cortex to map language functions precisely during the 
surgery. By the 1930s, the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield 
and his colleagues at the Montreal Neurological Institute 
had carried out a detailed localization of cortical capacities 
in a large number of patients (see Chapter 9). Penfield used 
electrical mapping techniques adapted from neurophysi- 
ological work in animals to delineate the language areas of 
the cortex prior to removing brain tissue in the treatment 
of tumors or epilepsy (Figure 27.5A). Such intraoperative 
mapping guaranteed that the cure would not be worse than 
the disease and has been widely used ever since, with in- 
creasingly sophisticated stimulation and recording meth- 
ods. As a result, a wealth of more detailed information 
about language localization has emerged. 
Penfield's observations, together with more recent 
studies performed by George Ojemann and his group at 
the University of Washington (and now by others), have 
further advanced the conclusions inferred from post mor- 
tem correlations and other approaches (Figure 27.5B). As 
expected, these studies using electrophysiological record- 
ing methods during surgery have shown that a large region 
of the perisylvian cortex of the left hemisphere is clearly 
involved in language production and comprehension. A 
surprise, however, has been the variability in language lo- 
calization from patient to patient. Ojemann found that the 
brain regions involved in language are only approximately 
those indicated by textbook treatments and that their lo- 
cations differ unpredictably among individuals. Equally 
unexpected, bilingual patients do not necessarily use the 
same bit of cortex for storing the names of the same object 
in two different languages. Moreover, although neurons 
in the temporal cortex in and around Wernicke's area re- 
spond preferentially to spoken words, they do not show 
preferences for a particular word. Rather, a wide range of 
words can elicit a response at any given recording site.

ited interference fall outside the classic language areas (Broca's 
area, shown in purple; Wernicke's area, shown in pink). (A after 
Penfield and Roberts, 1959; B after Ojemann et al., 1989.) 
Despite these advances, neurosurgical studies are com- 
plicated by their intrinsic difficulty, the risk involved, and 
to some extent by the fact that the brains of the patients in 
whom they are carried out are not "normal." The advent 
of noninvasive brain imaging—positron emission tomog- 
raphy (PET) in the 1980s and, more recently, functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (f(MRI)—has allowed the in- 
vestigation of language regions in normal subjects (Figure 
27.6). Recall that these techniques reveal the areas of the 
brain that are active during a particular task because the 
related electrical activity increases local metabolic activity

Language tasks such as listening to words and generating 
word associations elicit activity in Broca's and Wernicke's 
areas, as expected. However, there is also activity in primary 
and association sensory and motor areas for both active and 
passive language tasks. These observations indicate that lan- 
guage processing involves many cortical regions in addition 
to the classically identified language areas. (From Posner and 
Raichle, 1994.) 
and blood flow. Much like Ojemann's studies in neuro- 
surgical patients, the results of this approach, particu- 
larly in the hands of Marc Raichle, Steve Petersen, and 
their colleagues at Washington University in St. Louis, 
have challenged excessively rigid views of the localiza- 
tion and lateralization of linguistic function. Although 
high levels of activity occur in the expected regions, 
large areas of both hemispheres are activated in word 
recognition or production tasks. 
Finally, a number of investigators, including Hanna 
Damasio and her colleagues at the University of lowa 
and Alex Martin and his collaborators at the National 
Institutes of Mental Health, have shown that distinct 
regions of the temporal cortex are activated by tasks in 
which subjects carried out naming, viewing, or match- 
ing tasks that involved faces, animals, or tools (Figure 
27.7). Their observations help explain the clinical find- 
ing that when a relatively limited region of the tempo- 
ral lobe is damaged (usually, but by no means always, 
on the left side), language deficits are sometimes re- 
stricted to a particular category of objects. These stud- 
ies are also consistent with Ojemann's electrophysi- 
ological studies, which indicate that some aspects of

language are organized according to categories of mean- 
ing rather than individual words. Taken together, such 
studies are rapidly augmenting the information available 
about how language is represented in the brain. 
The Role of the Right Hemisphere 
Because the same gross anatomical and cytoarchitectonic 
areas exist in the cortex of both hemispheres, a puzzling 
issue remains. What do the comparable areas in the right 
hemisphere do? In fact, language deficits often do occur fol- 
lowing damage to the right hemisphere. The most obvious 
effect of such lesions is a loss of the normal rhythm, stress 
and tonal variation of speech—called prosody—that impart 
additional meaning to verbal communication. (Sometimes 
translated as "accent," the Greek word prosodias refers to 
setting of words to music.) This "coloring" of speech is criti- 
cal to the message conveyed; indeed, in some languages, 
such as Mandarin Chinese, variations in tone are used to 
change the semantic meaning of each syllable uttered. De- 
ficiencies in prosody, referred to as aprosodias, are associ- 
ated with right-hemisphere damage to the cortical regions 
that correspond to Broca's and Wernicke's areas and related 
regions in the left hemisphere. Aprosodias emphasize that 
although the left hemisphere (or, more specifically, rela- 
tively specialized cortical regions within that hemisphere) 
figures prominently in the comprehension and production 
of language for most humans, other regions, including 
Patient with signing deficit: 
corresponding and other areas in the right hemisphere, are 
needed to generate the full richness of everyday speech. 
In summary, whereas the classically defined regions of 
the left hemisphere operate more or less as advertised, a va- 
riety of more recent studies have shown that other left- and 
right-hemisphere areas clearly make significant contribu- 
tions to the generation and comprehension of language. 
Sign Language 
An implication of several aspects of the foregoing account 
is that the cortical organization of language does not sim- 
ply reflect specializations for hearing and speaking; the 
language regions of the brain appear to be more broadly 
organized for processing symbols pertinent to social com- 
munication. Strong support for this conclusion has come 
from studies of sign language in individuals deaf from birth. 
American Sign Language has all the components (gram- 
mar, syntax, and emotional tone) of spoken and heard lan- 
guage. Based on this knowledge, Ursula Bellugi and her 
colleagues at the Salk Institute examined the cortical local- 
ization of sign language abilities in patients who had suf- 
fered lesions of either the left or right hemisphere. None of 
these deaf individuals had ever heard spoken language. All 
of them had been signing throughout their lives, had deaf 
spouses, were members of the deaf community, and were 
right-handed. Patients with left-hemisphere lesions, which 
in each case involved the language areas of the frontal and/ 
or temporal lobes, had measurable deficits in sign produc- 
tion and comprehension when compared to normal signers 
Arrive

FIGURE 27.8 
Signing deficits in congen- 
itally deaf individuals. The subjects of this 
study had learned sign language from birth 
and later suffered lesions of the language 
areas in the left hemisphere. Left-hemisphere 
damage produced signing problems in these 
patients analogous to the aphasias seen 
after comparable lesions in hearing, speak- 
ing patients. In this example, the patient 
(upper panels) is expressing the sentence 
"We arrived in Jerusalem and stayed there." 
Compared to a normal control (lower panels), 
he cannot properly control some of the spa- 
tial orientations of the signs. The direction of 
the correct signs and the aberrant direction 
of the "aphasic" signs are indicated in the 
upper left-hand corner of each panel. (After 
Bellugi et al., 1989.)

(Figure 27.8). In contrast, patients with lesions in approxi- 
mately the same areas in the right hemisphere did not have 
such signing "aphasias." Instead, as predicted from hear- 
ing patients with similar lesions, right-hemisphere abili- 
ties such as visuospatial processing, emotional processing, 
and the emotional tone evident in signing were impaired. 
Although the number of subjects studied was necessarily 
small (congenitally deaf signers with lesions of the language 
areas are understandably few in number), the capacity for 
signed and seen communication is evidently represented 
predominantly in the left hemisphere, and in the same ar- 
eas as spoken language. This evidence accords with the idea 
that the language regions of the brain are specialized for 
the representation of social communication by means of 
symbols, rather than for heard and spoken language per se. 
The capacity for seen and signed communication, like 
its heard and spoken counterpart, emerges in early infancy. 
Careful observation of babbling in hearing (and, eventually, 
speaking) infants shows the production of a predictable pat- 
tern of sounds related to the ultimate acquisition of spoken 
language. Thus, babbling prefigures mature language and 
indicates that an innate capacity for language imitation is 
a key part of the process by which a full-blown language is 
ultimately acquired. The offspring of deaf, signing parents 
"babble" with their hands in gestures that are apparently 
the forerunners of mature signs (see Figure 24.10). Like 
verbal babbling, the amount of manual babbling increases 
with age until the child begins to form accurate, meaning- 
ful signs. These observations indicate that the strategy for 
acquiring the rudiments of symbolic communication from 
parental or other cues—regardless of the means of expres- 
sion—is similar. 
Summary 
The effort to understand the organization of language in the 
human brain began in the nineteenth century by correlat- 
ing clinical signs and symptoms with the location of brain 
lesions determined post mortem. In the twentieth century, 
additional clinical observations together with studies of 
split-brain patients, mapping at neurosurgery, transient 
anesthesia of a single hemisphere, and noninvasive im- 
aging techniques such as PET and fMRI have greatly ex- 
tended knowledge about the neural substrates of language. 
Together, these various approaches show that, in the vast 
majority of humans, the perisylvian cortices of the leit 
hemisphere are especially important for normal language. 
The right hemisphere also contributes importantly to lan- 
guage, most obviously by giving it emotional tone. The 
similarity of the deficits observed after comparable brain 
lesions in congenitally deaf individuals and their speaking 
counterparts show further that the cortical representation 
of language is independent of the means of its expression 
or perception (spoken and heard versus gestured and seen). 
SPEECH AND LANGUAGE 
623 
The specialized language areas that have been identified are 
evidently the major components of a widely distributed set 
of brain regions that allows humans to communicate effec- 
tively by means of symbols that can be attached to objects, 
concepts, and feelings.

SLEEP AND 
WAKEFULNESS 
Overview 
SLEEP, WHICH IS DEFINED BEHAVIORALLY by the normal suspension of con- 
sciousness and electrophysiologically by specific brain wave criteria, consumes fully 
one-third of our lives. Sleep occurs in all mammals, and probably in all vertebrates. 
We crave sleep when deprived of it and, to judge from animal studies, continued 
sleep deprivation can be fatal. In calling sleep "nature's soft nurse," Shakespeare em- 
phasized (as have many others) the restorative nature of sleep. Surprisingly, however, 
sleep is not the result of a simple diminution of brain activity. Indeed, in "rapid eye 
movement" (REM) sleep, the brain is about as active as it is when people are awake. 
Rather, sleep is a series of precisely controlled physiological states, the sequence of 
which is governed by a group of brainstem nuclei that projects widely throughout 
the brain and spinal cord. The reason for the high levels of brain activity during REM 
sleep, the significance of dreaming, and the basis of the restorative effect of sleep are 
all topics that remain poorly understood. The clinical importance of sleep is obvious 
from the prevalence of sleep disorders. In any given year an estimated 40 million 
Americans suffer from chronic sleep disorders, and an additional 30 million experi- 
ence occasional sleep problems that are severe enough to interfere with their daily 
activities. In consequence, the phenomenology of sleep presents major challenges in 
both basic neurobiology and clinical medicine. 
Why Do Humans (and Many Other Animals) Sleep? 
To feel rested and refreshed upon awakening, most adults require 7-8 hours of 
sleep, although this number varies among individuals (Figure 28.1A). For infants, 
the requirement is much higher (17 hours a day or more), and teenagers need on 
average about 9 hours of sleep. Thus we spend a substantial fraction of our lives in 
this mysterious state. As people age, they tend to sleep more lightly and for shorter 
times (Figure 28.1B). Older adults often "make up" for shorter and lighter nightly 
sleep periods by napping during the day. Getting too little sleep creates a "sleep 
debt" that must be repaid in the following days. In the meantime, judgment, reaction 
time, and other functions are impaired in varying degrees. Poor sleep therefore has a 
price, and sometimes tragic consequences. In the United States, fatigue is estimated

The duration of sleep. (A) In adults, the dura-

year, resulting in some 70,000 injuries and 1,500 deaths. 
Sleep (or at least a physiological period of quiescence) is 
a highly conserved behavior found in animals ranging from 
fruit flies to humans (Box 28A). Despite this prevalence, 
why we sleep is not well understood. Because an animal 
is particularly vulnerable while sleeping, there must be 
evolutionary advantages that outweigh this considerable 
disadvantage. From a perspective of energy conservation, 
one function of sleep is to replenish brain glycogen levels, 
which fall during the waking hours. In addition, since it is 
generally colder at night, more energy would have to be

which reflects stress, begins to increase toward 
morning and stays elevated for several hours.

expended to keep warm were we nocturnally active. Hu- 
man body temperature has a 24-hour cycle (as do many 
other indices of activity and stress; Figure 28.2), reaching a 
minimum at night and thus reducing heat loss. Metabolism 
measured by oxygen consumption decreases during sleep. 
Another plausible reason is that humans and many other 
animals that sleep at night are highly dependent on visual 
information to find food and avoid predators. A recent idea 
about the advantage of sleep proposes that memories, in 
the form of changes in the strength of synaptic connections 
induced by experiences during waking hours, are consoli- 
dated while we sleep. 
In mammals, sleep is evidently necessary for survival. 
Sleep-deprived rats lose weight despite increased food in- 
take and progressively fail to regulate body temperature, as 
their core temperature increases several degrees. They also 
develop infections, suggesting some compromise of the im- 
mune system. Rats completely deprived of sleep die within

Dolphins and seals show an especial-

of maintaining vigilance during sleep. 
Their sleep alternates between the two 
cerebral hemispheres (see figure). Thus, 
one hemisphere can exhibit the electro- 
encephalographic signs of wakefulness 
while the other shows the characteristics 
of sleep (see Box 28C and Figure 28.5). 
In short, although periods of rest are 
evidently essential to the proper func- 
tioning of the brain, and more generally 
to normal homeostasis, the manner in 
which rest is obtained depends on the 
particular needs of each species.

The Circadian Cycle of 
Sleep and Wakefulness 
Human sleep occurs with circadian (Latin 
for "about a day") periodicity, and biolo- 
gists have explored a number of questions 
about this 24-hour cycle. What happens, 
for example, when individuals are pre- 
vented from sensing the cues they nor- 
mally use to distinguish night and day? 
This question has been addressed by plac- 
ing volunteers in an environment such as a 
bunker that lacks external time cues (Figure 
28.4). In a typical experiment of this sort, 
subjects undergo a 5- to 8-day period of 
acclimatization that includes normal social 
interactions, meals at the usual times, and 
temporal cues (e.g., radio and television). 
During this period, the subjects typically 
arise and go to sleep at the usual times and

It was originally thought th at the cycle of sleep and wake-

subsequent work found the cycle to be closer to 24 hours.

physiological processes with the day-night cycle, the bio- 
logical clock must be able to detect decreases in light levels 
as night approaches. The receptors that sense these light 
changes are, not surprisingly, in the retina, as demonstrated 
by the fact that removing or covering the eyes abolishes 
photoentrainment. The most important retinal detectors are 
not rod or cone cells, however; rather, the cells that convey 
this information lie within the ganglion cell layer of both 
primate and murine retinas. Unlike rods and cones, which 
are hyperpolarized when activated by light (see Chapter 
11), these photosensitive retinal ganglion cells contain a 
novel photopigment called melanopsin and are depolar- 
ized by light (Figure 28.5A,B). The function of these unusual 
photoreceptors is evidently to encode environmental illu- 
mination and thus to set the biological clock—although in 
"melanopsin-knockout" mice, rods and cones are still able 
to mediate some circadian entrainment. 
The axons of these melanopsin-containing neurons run 
in the retinohypothalamic tract (Figure 28.5C), which proj- 
ects to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior 
hypothalamus, the central site of the circadian control of ho- 
meostatic functions. Activation of the SCN via this pathway 
evokes responses in the paraventricular nucleus of the hy- 
pothalamus and, ultimately, the preganglionic sympathetic 
neurons in the intermediolateral zone of the lateral horns of 
the thoracic spinal cord. As described in Chapter 21, these 
preganglionic neurons modulate neurons in the superior 
cervical ganglia whose postganglionic axons project to the 
pineal gland (pineal means "pinecone-like") in the midline 
near the dorsal thalamus (see Figure 28.5C). The pineal gland 
synthesizes the sleep-promoting neurohormone melatonin 
(N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) from tryptophan. When 
secreted into the bloodstream, melatonin modulates neu- 
ral activity by interacting with melatonin receptors on neu- 
rons in the SCN that in turn influence the.sleep—wake cycle. 
Melatonin synthesis increases as light from the environment 
decreases, reaching a maximum between 2 and 4 A.M. (Figure 
28.5D). In the elderly, the pineal gland produces less melato- 
nin, perhaps explaining why older people sleep less at night. 
Melatonin supplements have been used to promote sleep in 
elderly insomniacs and to reduce the disruption of biological 
clocks that occurs with jet lag, but it remains unclear whether 
these therapies are truly effective. 
Most sleep researchers consider the suprachiasmatic 
nucleus to be a "master clock." Evidence for this conclu- 
sion is that removal of the SCN in experimental animals 
abolishes their circadian sleep-wake cycle. Furthermore, 
when SCN cells are placed in organ culture, they exhibit 
characteristic circadian rhythms. Some other isolated cell 
types also show this rhythmicity, implying that the SCN 
is the apex of a hierarchy that governs other physiological 
timing functions that are synchronized with the sleep-wake

also called vasopressin). 
Stages of Sleep 
The normal cycle of human sleep and wakefulness implies 
that, at specific times, various neural systems are active 
while others are turned off. For centuries- -indeed, up until 
the 1950s—most researchers considered sleep a unitary 
phenomenon whose physiology was essentially passive 
and whose purpose was simply restorative. In 1953, how- 
ever, Nathaniel Kleitman and Eugene Aserinksy showed 
by means of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings 
from normal subjects that sleep actually comprises differ- 
ent stages that occur in a characteristic sequence. 
Over the first hour after retiring, humans descend into 
successive stages of sleep (Figure 28.6). These character- 
istic stages are defined primarily by electroencephalo- 
eraphic criteria (Box 28C). Initially, during "drowsiness,"

EEG recordings during the first hour of sleep. 
The waking state with the eyes open is characterized by high- 
frequency (15-60 Hz), low-amplitude activity (~30 uV) activity. This 
pattern is called beta activity. Descent into stage | non-REM sleep 
is characterized by decreasing EEG frequency (4-8 Hz) and increas- 
ing amplitude (50-100 pV), called theta waves. Descent into stage 
Il non-REM sleep is characterized by 10-12 Hz oscillations (50-150 
uV) called spindles, which occur periodically and last for a few 
seconds. Stages Ill and IV of non-REM sleep are characterized by 
slower waves (also called delta waves) at 0.5-4 Hz (100-150 LV). 
After reaching this level of deep sleep, the sequence reverses and 
a period of rapid eye movement sleep, or REM sleep, ensues. REM 
sleep is characterized by low-voltage, high-frequency activity similar 
to the EEG activity of individuals who are awake. Although diagram 
makes it appear that the amounts of sleep in each stage are about 
the same, the is not so (see text). (Adapted from Hobson, 1989.)

Although electrical activ- 
(A)

cerebral cortex of a monkey 
was reported in 1875, it was not 
until 1929 that Hans Berger, a 
psychiatrist at the University 
of Jena, Germany, first made 
scalp recordings of this activ- 
ity in humans. Since then, the 
electroencephalogram, or EEG, 
has received a mixed press. 
Touted by some as a unique 
opportunity to understand 
human thinking, the EEG is 
denigrated by others as too 
complex and poorly resolved 
to allow anything more than 
a superficial glimpse of what 
the brain is actually doing. The 
truth probably lies somewhere 
in between, but no one disputes 
that electroencephalography 
has provided a valuable tool to 
both researchers and clinicians, 
particularly in the fields of sleep 
physiology and epilepsy.

The alpha rhythm is typically recorded 
in awake subjects with their eyes 
closed. By definition, the frequency 
of the alpha rhythm is 8-13 Hz, with 
an amplitude that is typically 10-50 
mV. Lower-amplitude beta activity is 
defined by frequencies of 14-60 Hz 
and is indicative of mental activity and 
attention. The theta and delta waves, 
which are characterized by frequencies 
of 4-7 Hz and less than 4 Hz, respec- 
tively, imply drowsiness, sleep, or one 
of a variety of pathological conditions; 
these slow waves in normal individuals 
are the signature of stage IV non-REM 
sleep. The way these phenomena are 
generated is shown in Figures B and C. 
Far and away the most obvious com- 
ponent of these various oscillations is

(B) An electrode on the scalp measures the activity of a very 
large number of neurons in the underlying regions of 
the 
brain, each of which generates a small electrical field that 
changes over time. This activity (which is thought to be 
mostly synaptic) makes the more superficial extracellular 
space negative with respect to deeper cortical regions. The 
EEG electrode measures a synchronous signal because many 
thousands of cells are responding in the same manner at 
more or less the same time. (Adapted from Bear et al., 2001.)

and Giuseppe Moruzzi showed that the 
Bie 
reticular activating system in the brain- 
stem is also important in modulating 
EEG activity. For example, activation 
of the reticular formation changes the 
cortical alpha rhythm to beta activity, 
in association with greater behavioral 
alertness. In the 1960s, Per Andersen 
and his colleagues in Sweden further 
advanced these studies by showing 
that virtually all areas of the cortex 
participate in these oscillatory rhythms, 
which reflect a feedback loop between 
neurons in the thalamus and cortex (see 
Figure 28.11). 
The cortical origin of EEG activity 
has been clarified by animal studies, 
which have shown that the source of 
the current that causes the fluctuating 
scalp potential is primarily the pyrami- 
dal neurons and their synaptic connec- 
tions in the deeper layers of the cortex 
(see Figures B and C). (This conclusion 
was reached by noting the location 
of electrical field reversal upon pass- 
ing an electrode vertically through the 
cortex from surface to white matter.) In 
general, oscillations come about either 
because membrane voltage of thalamo- 
cortical cells fluctuates spontaneously or 
as a result of the reciprocal interaction 
of excitatory and inhibitory neurons 
in circuit loops. The oscillations of the 
EEG are thought to arise from the latter 
mechanism. 
Despite these intriguing observa- 
tions, the functional significance of 
these cortical rhythms is not known. 
The purpose of the brain's remarkable 
oscillatory activity is a puzzle that has 
defied electroencephalographers and 
neurobiologists for more than 70 years.

it is somehow linked to visual process- 
ing, as was first proposed in 1935 by 
the British physiologist Edgar Adrian. 
In fact, evidence from large numbers of 
subjects suggests that at least several 
different regions of the brain have their 
own characteristic rhythms; for exam- 
ple, within the alpha band (8-13 Hz), 
one rhythm, the classic alpha rhythm, is 
associated with visual cortex, one (the 
mu rhythm) with the sensory motor 
cortex around the central sulcus, and 
yet another (the kappa rhythm) with 
the auditory cortex. 
In the 1940s, Edward Dempsey and 
Robert Morrison showed that these 
EEG rhythms depend in part on activity 
in the thalamus, since thalamic lesions 
can reduce or abolish the oscillatory 
cortical discharge (although some oscil- 
latory activity remains even after the 
thalamus has been inactivated). At 
about the same time, Horace Magoun

sleep. (Adapted from Bear et al., 2001.) 
the frequency spectrum of the electroencephalogram shifts 
toward lower values and the amplitude of the cortical waves 
increases slightly. This drowsy period, called stage I sleep, 
eventually gives way to light stage II sleep, which is char- 
acterized by a further decrease in the frequency of the EEG 
waves and an increase in their amplitude, together with 
intermittent high-frequency spike clusters called sleep 
spindles. Sleep spindles are periodic bursts of activity at 
about 10-12 Hz that generally last 1-2 seconds and arise 
as a result of interactions between thalamic and cortical 
neurons (see below). In stage III sleep, which represents 
moderate to deep sleep, the number of spindles decreases, 
whereas the amplitude of EEG activity increases further and 
the frequency continues to fall. In the deepest level of sleep, 
stage IV sleep, the predominant EEG activity consists of 
very low frequency (0.5—4 Hz), high-amplitude fluctuations 
called delta waves, the characteristic slow waves for which 
this phase of sleep is named; stages III and IV together are 
known as slow-wave sleep. (Note that delta waves can 
also be thought of as reflecting synchronized electrical ac- 
tivity of cortical neurons.) The entire sequence from drowsi- 
ness to stage IV sleep usually takes about an hour. 
Taken together, sleep stages I-IV are called non-rapid 
eye movement, or non-REM sleep. The most prominent 
feature of non-REM sleep is the slow-wave stage IV. It is 
more difficult to awaken people from slow-wave sleep, 
which is therefore considered to be the deepest stage of 
sleep. Following.a period of slow-wave sleep, however, 
EEG recordings show that subjects enter a quite different 
state called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. EEG re- 
cordings of REM sleep are remarkably similar to those of 
subjects in the awake state (see Figure 28.6). After about 
10 minutes in REM sleep, the brain typically cycles back 
through the four non-REM sleep stages. Slow-wave sleep is 
usually most pronounced earlier in an 8-hour sleep episode, 
but occurs periodically during any given night (Figure 28.7). 
On average, four additional periods of REM sleep occut, 
each having a longer duration.

SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS 
635 
In summary, the typical 8 hours of sleep 
experienced each night actually comprise 
several cycles that alternate between 
non-REM and REM sleep, and the brain 
is quite active during much of this suppos- 
edly dormant, restful time. The amount of 
daily REM sleep decreases from about 8 
hours at birth to 2 hours at 20 years to only 
about 45 minutes at 70 years of age. The 
reasons for this change over the human 
lifespan are not known. 
Physiological Changes 
in Sleep States 
A variety of additional physiological 
changes take place during the differ- 
ent stages of sleep (Figure 28.7). Stage 
I sleep is characterized by slow, rolling 
eye movements followed by decreases in 
muscle tone, body movements, heart rate, 
breathing, blood pressure, metabolic rate, 
and temperature. All these parameters 
reach their lowest values during stage IV 
sleep. Periods of REM sleep, in contrast, 
are accompanied by increases in blood 
pressure, heart rate, and metabolism to 
levels almost as high as those found in the 
awake state. REM sleep, as the name im- 
plies, is also characterized by rapid, ballis- 
tic eye movements, pupillary constriction, 
paralysis of many large muscle groups 
(although obviously not the diaphragm 
and other muscles used for breathing), 
and the twitching of the smaller muscles 
in the fingers, toes, and the middle ear. 
Spontaneous penile erection also occurs 
during REM sleep, a fact that is clinically 
important in determining whether a com- 
plaint of impotence has a physiological or 
psychological basis. REM sleep has been 
observed in all mammals and in at least 
some birds; certain reptiles also have peri- 
ods of increased brain activity during sleep 
that are arguably homologous to REM 
sleep in mammals. 
Despite the similarity of EEG record- 
ings obtained in REM sleep and in wake- 
fulness, the two brain states are clearly 
not equivalent. For one thing, REM sleep 
is characterized by a greater prevalence of 
dreaming (see below), a unique state of 
awareness that entails some features of 
memory and hallucinations in the sense

that the experience of dreams is not related to correspond- 
ing sensory stimuli arising from the present environment. 
Since most muscles are inactive during REM sleep, the mo- 
tor responses to dreams are relatively minor. (Sleepwalking, 
which is most common in children ages 4-12, and "sleep- 
talking" actually occur during non-REM sleep and are not 
usually accompanied or motivated by dreams.) The relative 
physical paralysis during REM sleep arises from increased 
activity in GABAergic neurons in the pontine reticular for- 
mation that project to inhibitory neurons that synapse in 
turn with lower motor neurons in the spinal cord (Figure 
28.8). Increased activity of descending inhibitory projections 
from the pons to the dorsal column nuclei also causes a 
diminished response to somatic sensory stimuli. 
Taken together, these observations have led to the apho- 
rism that non-REM sleep is characterized by an inactive 
brain in an active body, whereas REM sleep is character- 
ized by an active brain in an inactive body. In any event, it 
is apparent that a variety of sensory and motor systems are 
sequentially activated and inactivated during the different 
stages of sleep. 
Other Possible Functions 
of Sleep and Dreaming 
Despite the wealth of descriptive information about the 
stages of sleep and an intense research effort over the last 
50 years, the functional purposes of the various sleep states

remain poorly understood. Whereas most sleep research- 
ers accept the idea that the purpose of non-REM sleep is at 
least in part restorative, the function of REM sleep and sleep 
in general remains a matter of considerable controversy. 
A clue about additional purposes of sleep concerns 
dreams. The time of occurrence of dreams during sleep has 
been determined by waking volunteers during either non- 
REM or REM sleep and asking them if they were dreaming. 
Subjects awakened from REM sleep usually recall elaborate, 
vivid, and often emotional dreams; subjects awakened dur- 
ing non-REM sleep report fewer dreams, and when dreams 
do occur, they are more conceptual, less vivid, and tend to 
be less emotion-laden. Dreaming during light non-REM 
sleep tends to be more prevalent near the onset of sleep and 
before awakening. In any event, dreaming is not limited to 
REM sleep. 
Dreams have been studied in a variety of ways, perhaps 
most notably within the psychoanalytic framework aimed 
at revealing unconscious thought processes considered to 

be at the root of neuroses. Sigmund Freud's The Interpreta- 
tion of Dreams, published in 1900, speaks eloquently to the 
complex relationship between conscious and unconscious 
mentation. Freud thought that during dreaming the con- 
scious "ego" relaxes its hold on the "id," or subconscious. 
These ideas have been out of fashion in recent decades, but 
to give Freud his due, at the time he made these specula- 
tions little was known about neurobiology of the brain in 
general and sleep in particular. In fact, some recent evidence 
supports Freud's idea that dreams often reflect events and 
conflicts of the day (the "day residue," in his terminology) 
and may play a role in memory. A number of investigators 
have suggested that dreams help consolidate learned tasks, 
perhaps by further strengthening synaptic changes associ- 
ated with recent experiences. The more general hypothesis 
that sleep is important in consolidating memories has been 
supported by studies of remembered spatial location in ro- 
dents in which ensembles of hippocampal neurons acti- 
vated during a spatial memory task are reactivated during 
subsequent sleep, and by experiments in humans that show 
a sleep-dependent improvement in learning. 
A quite different idea is that dreaming has evolved to 
dispose of unwanted memories that accumulate during 
the day. Francis Crick, for example, suggested that dreams 
might reflect a mechanism for expunging "parasitic" modes 
of thought that would otherwise become overly intrusive, 
as occurs in compulsive thought disorders. Finally, some 
experts such as Allan Hobson have taken the more skeptical 
view that dream content may be "as much dross as gold, 
as much cognitive trash as treasure, as much informational 
noise as a signal of something." 
Adding to the uncertainty about the purposes sleep and 
dreaming is the fact that depriving human subjects of REM 
sleep for as much as 2 weeks has little or no obvious effect 
on their behavior. Furthermore, patients taking serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors for depression have markedly less REM 
sleep. The apparent innocuousness of REM sleep depriva-

these findings is that we can get along without REM sleep, 
but we need non-REM sleep in order to survive. 
Neural Circuits Governing Sleep 
From the descriptions of the various physiological states 
that occur during sleep, it is clear that periodic changes in 
the balance of excitation and inhibition must occur in many 
neural circuits. What follows is a brief overview of these 
still incompletely understood circuits and the interactions 
among them that govern sleep and wakefulness. 
In 1949, Horace Magoun and Giuseppe Moruzzi pro- 
vided one of the first pieces of evidence about the circuits 
involved in the sleep-wake cycle. They found that electri- 
cally stimulating a group of neurons near the junction of 
the pons and midbrain causes a state of wakefulness and 
arousal. This region of the brainstem was given the name 
reticular activating system (Figure 28.9A; see also Box 
17D). Their work implied that wakefulness requires special- 
ized activating circuitry—that is, wakefulness is not just the 
result of adequate sensory experience. At about the same 
time, the Swiss physiologist Walter Hess found that stimu- 
'lating the thalamus in an awake cat with low-frequency 
pulses produced a slow-wave sleep (Figure 28.9B). These 
key experiments showed that sleep entails a patterned in- 
teraction between the thalamus and cortex. 
Further evidence was provided by work on the circuitry 
underlying REM sleep. The saccade-like eye movements 
that define REM sleep are now known to arise because, in 
the absence of external visual stimuli, endogenously gen- 
erated signals from the pontine reticular formation are 
transmitted to the motor region of the superior colliculus. 
As described in Chapter 20, collicular neurons project to 
the paramedial pontine reticular formation (PPRF) and 
the rostral interstitial nucleus, which coordinates timing 
and direction of eye movements. REM sleep is also char- 
acterized by EEG waves that originate in the pontine re- 
ticular formation and propagate through the lateral genicu- 
late nucleus of the thalamus to the occipital cortex. These

CHAPTER 28 
BOX 28D Consciousness 
_ As the text explains, the mechanisms 
of sleep and wakefulness determine 
mental status at any moment on a con- 
tinuum that normally ranges from stage 
IV sleep to high alert. There is, how- 
ever, another way that "wakefulness" 
has been considered, namely from the 
_ perspective of consciousness in the sense 
_ of self-awareness. Although the brain- 
- stem circuits and projections support- 
_ ing consciousness are beginning to be 
understood, these neurological aspects 
_ of consciousness are—not surpris- 
_ ingly— insufficient to satisfy philoso- 
phers, theologians, and neuroscientists 
_ interested in the broader issues that the 
phenomenon of consciousness raises. 
) 
The common concern of these 
_ diverse groups is the more general basis 
of self-awareness, including whether 
_ other animals have this mental property 
and whether machines could ever be 
self-aware in the way humans are. 
With respect to the first of these issues, 
despite a longstanding debate about 
consciousness in other animals, it 
would be unwise to assert that humans 
are alone in possessing this obviously 
useful biological attribute. However, 
from a purely logical vantage it is 
impossible, strictly speaking, to know 
whether any being other than one's 
own self is conscious; as philosophers 
have long pointed out, we must inevita- 
bly take the consciousness of others on 
faith (or on the basis of common sense). 
Nonetheless, it is reasonable to 
assume that animals with brains struc- 
tured much like ours (other primates 
and, to a considerable degree, mam- 
mals generally) have in some measure 
the same ability to be self-aware as we 
do. The ability to reflect on the past 
and plan for the future that is made 
possible by self-awareness is surely an 
advantage that evolution would have in 
some degree inculcated in at least the 
similar brains of higher primates. At 
what phylogenetic level this assumption 
_ 
about self-awareness falls below the 
definition of consciousness as we know 
it is unclear. A good supposition would 
be that consciousness is present in ani- 
mals in proportion to the complexity of 
their brains and behaviors—particularly 
those behaviors that are sophisticated 
enough to benefit from reflecting on 
past outcomes and future eventualities. 
The question of whether machines 
can ever be conscious is a much more 
contentious issue, but is also subject 
to common sense informed by some 
knowledge of how brains work. If one 
pontine-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves provide a useful 
marker for the beginning of REM sleep; they also indicate 
yet another neural network by which brainstem nuclei can 
activate the cortex. 
A further advance has come from fMRI and PET studies 
(see Box 1B) that have compared human brain activity in the 
awake state and in REM sleep, as well as studies of the phe- 
nomenon of consciousness more generally (Box 28D). Ac- 
tivity in the amygdala, parahippocampus, pontine tegmen- 
tum, and anterior cingulate cortex increases during REM 
sleep, whereas activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal and 
posterior cingulate cortices decreases (Figure 28.10). The 
increase in limbic system activity, coupled with a marked 
decrease in the influence of the frontal cortex during REM 
sleep, presumably explains some characteristics of dreams 
(e.g., their heightened emotionality in REM sleep and their 
often inappropriate social content; see Chapter 26 for a 
discussion of the normal role of the frontal cortex in deter- 
mining behavior that is appropriate to circumstances in the 
waking state). 
On the basis of these discoveries and other studies us- 
ing unit recording in experimental animals, it is now gen- 
erally agreed that a key component of the reticular acti- 
vating system is a group of cholinergic nuclei near the 
FIGURE 28.10

rejects dualism—the Cartesian proposi- 
tion that consciousness, or "mind," is 
an entity beyond the ken of physics, 
_ chemistry, and biology and therefore is 
_ not subject to the rules of these disci- 
_ plines—it follows that a structure could 
_ be built that either mimicked human 
_ consciousness (by being effectively 
_ isomorphic with brains) or achieved 
_ consciousness using physically differ- 
_ ent elements (e.g., computer elements). 
_ Such a structure could conceivably be 
_ sufficiently similar to biological brains 
_ 
to allow self-awareness. 
A great deal of literature on the sub- 
ject notwithstanding, such questions 
_ about consciousness are not readily 
subject to neurobiological investigation. 
Although a number of contemporary 
_ scientists have advocated the idea 
_ that neurobiology will soon reveal the 
"basis" of consciousness, such revela- 
tions are not likely. A more plausible 
scenario is that as information grows 
about the nature of other animals, 
about computers, and indeed about the 
brain, the question "What is conscious- 
ness?" will simply fade from center 
stage in much the same way that the 
question "What is life?" (which stirred 
up a similar debate for most of the 
twentieth century) was asked less and 
less frequently as biologists and others 
recognized it to be an ill-posed problem 
that admits no definite answer. We can 
already create many aspects of living 
organisms in the laboratory, and there 
seems to be no reason in principle why 
artificial neural networks capable of 
self-awareness should not someday be 
possible.

rons (Figure 28.11). The relevant neurons in the nuclei are 
characterized by high discharge rates during both waking 
and REM sleep, and by quiescence during non-REM sleep. 
When stimulated, these nuclei cause "desynchronization" 
of the electroencephalogram (i.e., a shift of EEG activity 
from high-amplitude, synchronized waves to lower-am- 
plitude, higher-frequency, desynchronized waves; see Box 
28C). These features imply that activity of cholinergic neu- 
rons in the reticular activating system is a primary cause of 
wakefulness and REM sleep and that their relative inactivity 
is important for producing non-REM sleep.

These circuits responsible for the awake state are peri- 
odically inhibited by neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic 
nucleus (VLPO) of the hypothalamus (see Figure 28.11). 
Thus, activation of VLPO neurons contributes to the onset 
of sleep, and lesions of VLPO neurons tend to produce in- 
somnia. As if all this were not complicated enough, recent 
work suggests that adenosine neurotransmission in the 
basal forebrain is also involved 
in the regulation of sleep. 
These complex interactions and effects are summarized 
in Table 28.1. In brief, both monoaminergic and choliner- 
gic systems are active during the waking state, and their 
decreased activity leads to the onset of non-REM sleep. In 
REM sleep, monoaminergic and serotonergic neurons are 
markedly less active, while cholinergic levels of activity in- 
crease to approximately the levels found in the awake state. 
Given that so many systems and transmitters are in- 
volved in the different phases of sleep, it is not surprising 
that a wide variety of drugs can influence the sleep cycle 
(Box 28E). 
SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS 
641 
Thalamocortical Interactions in Sleep 
The effects of the neuronal activity (or its absence) in these 
brainstem nuclei are achieved by modulating the interac- 
tions between the thalamus and the cortex. Thus, the ac- 
tivity of several ascending systems from the brainstem de- 
creases both the rhythmic bursting of the thalamocortical 
neurons and the related synchronized activity of cortical 
neurons (hence the diminution and ultimate disappearance 
of high-voltage, low-frequency slow waves during waking 
and during REM sleep; see Box 28C). 
To appreciate how different sleep states reflect modula- 
tion of thalamocortical activity, consider the electrophysi- 
ological responses of the relevant neurons. Thalamocorti- 
cal neurons receive ascending projections from the locus 
coeruleus (noradregeneric), raphe nuclei (serotonergic), 
reticular activating system (cholinergic), and TMN (hista- 
minergic), and, as their name implies, project to cortical py- 
ramidal cells. The primary characteristic of thalamocortical

the thalamocortical neuron is hyperpolarized sufficiently to activate low-threshold 
calcium channels. These bursts account for the spindle activity seen in EEG recordings 
in stage Il sleep (see Figure 28.6 and 28.13). Depolarizing the cell either by injecting 
current or by stimulating the reticular activating system transforms this oscillatory 
activity into a tonically active mode. (After McCormick and Pape, 1990.)

neurons is that they can be in one of two stable electrophys- 
iological states: an intrinsic bursting (or oscillatory) state; 
or a tonically active state. The latter is generated when 
the thalamocortical neurons are depolarized, such as occurs 
when the reticular activating system generates wakefulness 
(Figure 28.12). In the tonically active state, thalamocortical 
neurons transmit information to the cortex that is corre- 
lated with the spike trains encoding peripheral stimuli. In 
contrast, when thalamocortical neurons are in the bursting 
state, the neurons in the thalamus become synchronized 
with those in the cortex, essentially "disconnecting" the 
cortex from the outside world. The disconnection is maxi- 
mal during slow-wave sleep, when EEG recordings show 
the lowest frequency and the highest amplitude. 
The oscillatory, or bursting, state of thalamocortical neu- 
rons can be transformed into the tonically active state by ac- 
tivity in the cholinergic or monoaminergic projections from 
the brainstem nuclei (Figure 28.13). Moreover, the bursting 
state is stabilized by hyperpolarizing the relevant thalamic 
cells. Such hyperpolarization occurs as a consequence of 
stimulation by GABAergic neurons in the thalamic reticu- 
lar nucleus. These neurons receive ascending information 
from the brainstem and descending projections from corti- 
cal neurons, and they contact the thalamocortical neurons. 
When neurons in the reticular nucleus undergo a burst 
of activity, they cause thalamocortical neurons to gener- 
ate short bursts of action potentials, which in turn gener- 
ate spindle activity in cortical EEG recordings (indicating a 
lighter sleep state; see Figures 28.5 and 28.13). 
In sum, the control of sleep and wakefulness depends 
on brainstem modulation of the thalamus and cortex. It 
is this modulation of the thalamocortical loop that gener- 
ates the EEG signature of brain function along the con- 
tinuum of deep sleep to high alert. The major components 
of the modulatory system are the cholinergic nuclei of the 
pons—midbrain junction; the noradrenergic cells of the lo- 
cus coeruleus in the pons; the serotonergic raphe nuclei; 
and GABAergic neurons in the VLPO of the hypothala- 
mus. All of these nuclei exert both direct and indirect effects 
on the overall cortical activity that determines sleep and

Sleep Disorders 
As noted earlier, a substantial fraction of the U.S. popula- 
tion experiences some kind of sleep disorder at one time or 
another. Sleep problems, which range from simply annoy- 
ing to life-threatening, occur more frequently with advanc- 
ing age and are more prevalent in women than in men. 
The most significant problems are insomnia, sleep apnea, 
"restless legs" syndrome, and narcolepsy. 
Insomnia is the inability to sleep for a sufficient length 
of time (or deeply enough) to produce a subjective sense 
of refreshment. This all-too-common problem has many 
causes. Short-term insomnia can arise from stress, jet lag, 
or simply drinking too much coffee. Another frequent cause 
is altered circadian rhythms associated with working night 
shifts. Improving sleep habits, avoiding stimulants such as 
caffeine, and, in some cases, taking sleep-promoting medi- 
cations can usually prevent these problems. Although " gar- 
den variety" insomnia is not a serious medical problem, its 
consequences with respect to job efficiency and susceptibil- 
ity to accidents are great indeed. 
More debilitating insomnia is associated with major de- 
pression (see Chapter 29), which presumably affects the 
balance between the cholinergic, adrenergic, and serotiner- 
gic systems that control the onset and duration of the sleep 
cycles. Long-term insomnia is a particular problem in the

elderly for reasons that are not well understood. Whatever 
the underlying physiology, the problem is aggravated by 
the fact that aged individuals are more prone to depression 
and often take medications that affect the neurotransmitter 
systems (and thus affect sleep patterns). 
Sleep apnea refers to a pattern of interrupted breathing 
during sleep that affects many people, most often obese 
middle-aged males. A person suffering from sleep apnea 
may wake up dozens or more times during the night, with 
the result that they experience little or no slow-wave sleep 
and spend less time in REM sleep (Figure 28.15). As a re- 
sult, these individuals are continually tired and prone to 
depression, which can compound the problem. Sleep apnea 
can even lead to death from respiratory arrest because the 
airway in susceptible individuals tends to collapse during 
sleep, thus blocking normal airflow. In sleep, breathing

Sleep pattern of a patient 
with obstructive sleep apnea. In this con- 
dition, patients awake frequently and never 
descend into stage Ill or IV sleep. The brief 
descents below stage | in the record represent 
short periods of REM sleep. (After Carskadon 
and Dement, 1989, based on data from 
G. Nifo-Murcia.) 
slows and muscle tone decreases throughout the body, in- 
cluding the tone of the pharynx. If the output of the brain- 
stem circuitry regulating commands to the chest wall or to 
pharyngeal muscles is decreased sufficiently, or if the air- 
way is already compressed because of obesity, the pharynx 
tends to collapse as the muscles relax during the normal 
cycle of breathing. As a result, oxygen levels decrease and 
CO, levels rise. The rise in CO, causes an abrupt reflex in- 
spiration, the force of which tends to wake up the affected 
individual. The most widely used remedy for sleep apnea is 
a positive-pressure mask that enhances airflow when worn 
during sleep. 
Restless legs syndrome is a problem that affects many 
(again, mostly elderly) people. The disorder is characterized 
by unpleasant crawling, prickling, or tingling sensations in 
one or both legs and feet, and the urge to move them about 
BOX 28F Chronic Fatigue Syndrome 
Although chronic fatigue syndrome 
is not a sleep disorder, it seems most 
appropriate to consider this puzzling 
and important disorder in the context of 
this chapter. The syndrome is charac- 
terized by debilitating fatigue and other 
symptoms, such as unrefreshing sleep, 
memory and concentration problems, 
and a feeling of extraordinary tiredness 
after routine exercise. CFS as a disorder 
in its own right was brought to clinical 
attention in 1988, The usual definition 
includes 6 months or more of persis- 
tent or relapsing fatigue that impairs 
the individuals ability to function and 
is not relieved by sleep or rest. Other 
common symptoms can include tender 
lymph nodes, sore throat, muscle pain, 
joint pain without swelling or redness, 
and headaches of new type, pattern, or 
severity. 
The onset of CFS often follows a flu- 
like illness; it then tends to be chronic, 
with only a minority of patients return- 
ing to a normal level of vigor. There 
are no specific tests for the disorder, 
which must be distinguished clinically 
from depression, Lyme disease, and 
other chronic diseases that can cause 
some of the same signs and symptoms. 
Treatment of CFS is primarily manage- 
ment of symptoms, and often includes 
cognitive behavioral therapy as well 
as a graduated exercise regimen that 
attempts to maximize the patient's 
stamina while not over-expending their 
available energy. Rather than offer- 
ing a cure, this approach focuses on 
improving a person's ability to cope 
with this illness.

individual sits or lies down for prolonged periods. The result 
is constant leg movement during the day and fragmented 
sleep at night. The underlying cause of this syndrome is not 
understood, although it is more frequent in patients with 
chronic diseases. In mild cases, a hot bath, massaging the 
legs, or eliminating caffeine may alleviate the problem. In 
more severe cases, drugs such as benzodiazepines may help. 
Narcolepsy is a chronic problem that affects about 
250,000 people (mostly men) in the United States. Individu- 
als with narcolepsy have frequent "REM sleep attacks" dur- 
ing the day, in which they enter REM sleep from wakeful- 
ness without going through non-REM sleep. These attacks 
can last from 30 seconds to 30 minutes or more. The onset 
of sleep in such individuals can be abrupt, with potentially 
disastrous consequences. This phenomenon entails a tem- 
porary loss of muscle control and is called cataplexy. Insights 
into the causes of narcolepsy have come from studies of 
dogs that suffer from a genetic disorder similar to the hu- 
man condition. In these animals, narcolepsy is caused by a 
mutation of the orexin-2 receptor gene (Orx2). (As already 
mentioned, orexins are neuropeptides homologous to se- 
cretin and are found exclusively in cells in the tuberal re- 
gion of the hypothalamus, which project to target nuclei re- 
sponsible for wakefulness; see Figure 28.11.) Evidence from 
both dogs and mice suggests that the Orx2 mutation causes 
hyperexcitability of the neurons that generate REM sleep 
and/or impairment of the circuits that inhibit REM sleep. 
Clinically, narcoleptics are treated with stimulants such as 
methylphenidate (Ritalin®), Modafinil®, or amphetamines 
to increase their overall level of arousal. 
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is not a sleep dis- 
order per se, but is believed to represent a related clinical 
problem (Box 28F). 
Summary 
All animals exhibit a restorative cycle of rest following activ- 
ity, but only mammals divide the period of rest into distinct 
phases of non-REM and REM sleep. Why humans (and 
many other animals) need a restorative phase of suspended 
consciousness accompanied by decreased metabolism and 
lowered body temperature is not known. Even more mys- 
terious is why the human brain is periodically active during 
sleep at levels not appreciably different from the waking 
state (that is, the neural activity during REM sleep). Despite 
the electroencephalographic similarities, the psychological 
states of wakefulness and REM sleep are obviously differ- 
ent. The highly organized sequence of human sleep states is 
actively generated by nuclei in the brainstem, most impor- 
tantly the cholinergic nuclei of the pons—midbrain junction, 
the noradrenergic cells of the locus coeruleus, and the se- 
rotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei. This control by the 
brainstem of the cortical states is mediated by modulation

of activity in a thalamocortical loop. This complex physi- 
ological interplay involving brainstem, thalamus, and cor- 
tex controls the degree of mental alertness on a continuum 
from deep sleep to waking attentiveness. A circadian clock 
located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and VLPO of the 
hypothalamus in turn influences these systems. The clock 
adjusts the overall periods of sleep and wakefulness to ap- 
propriate durations during the 24-hour cycle of light and 
darkness that is fundamental to life on Earth.

EMOTIONS 
Overview 
THE SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS AND ASSOCIATED PHYSIOLOGICAL STATES 
known as emotions are essential features of normal human experience. Moreover, 
some of the most devastating psychiatric problems involve emotional (affective) 
disorders. Emotions as varied as happiness, surprise, anger, fear, and sadness share 
some common characteristics. All emotions are expressed through both visceral mo- 
tor changes and stereotyped somatic motor responses, especially movements of the 
facial muscles. These responses accompany subjective experiences that are not easily 
described, but which are much the same in all human cultures. Because emotional ex- 
pression is closely tied to the visceral motor system, it entails the activity of the central 
brain structures that govern preganglionic autonomic neurons in the brainstem and 
spinal cord. Historically, the higher order neural centers that coordinate emotional 
responses have been grouped under the rubric of the limbic system. More recently, 
several brain regions in addition to the classical limbic system have been shown to play 
pivotal roles in emotional processing; these include the amygdala, several cortical areas 
in the orbital and medial aspects of the frontal lobe, and related subcortical circuitry. 
This broad constellation of cortical and subcortical regions encompasses not only the 
central components of the visceral motor system but also regions in the forebrain and 
diencephalon that motivate lower motor neuronal pools concerned with the somatic 
expression of emotional behavior. The concerted action of these diverse brain regions 
effectively constitutes an emotional motor system. The same forebrain structures that 
process emotional signals participate in a variety of complex brain functions, including 
the regulation of goal-directed behavior, the interpretation and expression of social 
behavior, rational decision-making, and even moral judgments. Unfortunately, these 
same brain systems are subject to maladaptation when exposed to drugs of abuse or 
when life experiences interact with genetic factors to promote psychiatric illness. 
Physiological Changes Associated with Emotion 
The most obvious signs of emotional arousal involve changes in the activity of the vis- 
ceral (autonomic) motor system described in Chapter 21. Thus, increases or decreases 
in heart rate, cutaneous blood flow (blushing or turning pale), piloerection ("hair

CHAPTER 29 
In 1862, the French neurologist and 
_ physiologist G.-B. Duchenne de 
_ Boulogne published a remarkable trea- 
_ tise. His work was the first to system- 
_ atically examine the contributions of 
_ small groups of cranial muscles to the 
_ facial expressions that communicate the 
_ richness of human emotion. Duchenne 
_ reasoned that "one would be able, like 
nature herself, to paint the expressive 
_ lines of the emotions of the soul on the 
_ face of man." In so doing, he sought to 
_ understand how the coordinated con- 
_ tractions of groups of muscles express 
_ distinct, pan-cultural emotional states. 
_ To achieve this goal, he pioneered the 
' use of transcutaneous electrical stimula- 
- tion (then called "faradization," after the 
_ British chemist and physicist Michael 
_ Faraday) to activate single muscles and 
_ small groups of muscles in the face, 
- 
dorsal surface of the head, and neck. In 
_ 
addition, he documented the faces of 
his subjects with another technological 
innovation—photography (Figure A). 
Duchenne's seminal contribution 
was the identification of muscles and 
muscle groups, such as the obicularis 
oculi, that are not easily controlled by 
_ force of the will but are mainly "put 
into play by the sweet emotions of 
the soul." Duchenne concluded that 
the emotion-driven contraction of the 
muscle groups surrounding the eyes, 
together with the zygomaticus major, 
convey the genuine experience of hap- 
piness, joy, and laughter. In recognition 
of these insights, psychologists some- 
times refer to this facial expression as 
the "Duchenne smile." 
(A) @) 
BOX 29A Facial Expressions: Pyramidal and Extrapyramidal Contributions 
In normal individuals, such as the 
Parisian shoemaker shown here, the 
difference between a forced smile 
(produced by voluntary contraction or 
electrical stimulation of facial muscles) 
and a spontaneous (emotional) smile 
testifies to the convergence of descend- 
ing motor signals from different fore- 
brain centers onto premotor and motor 
neurons in the brainstem that control 
the facial musculature. In contrast to the 
Duchenne smile, the contrived, volition- 
al smile (sometimes called a "pyramidal 
smile") is driven by the motor cortex, 
which communicates with the brain- 
stem and spinal cord via the pyramidal 
tracts. The Duchenne smile is motivated 
by motor areas in the anterior cingulate 
gyrus (see Box 17A) that access facial 
motor circuitry via multisynaptic extra- 
pyramidal pathways through the brain- 
stem reticular formation. 
Studies of patients with specific 
neurological injury to these separate 
descending systems of control have fur- 
ther differentiated the forebrain centers 
responsible for control of the muscles 
of facial expression (Figure B). Patients. 
with unilateral facial paralysis due to 
damage of descending pathways from 
the motor cortex (upper motor neuron 
syndrome; see Chapter 17) have con- 
siderable difficulty moving their lower 
facial muscles on one side, either vol- 
untarily or in response to commands, a 
condition called voluntary facial paresis 
(Figure B, top panels). Nonetheless, 
many such individuals produce sym- 
metrical involuntary facial movements 
when they laugh, frown, or cry in 
response to amusing or distressing 
stimuli. In such patients, pathways from — 
regions of the forebrain other than the 
classical motor cortex in the posterior 
frontal lobe remain available to activate 
facial movements in response to stimuli 
with emotional significance. 
A much less common form of neu- 
rological injury, called emotional facial 
paresis, demonstrates the opposite set 
of impairments—that is, the loss of the 
ability to express emotions by using 
the muscles of the face without loss 
of volitional control (Figure B, bottom 
panels). Such individuals are able to 
produce symmetrical pyramidal smiles, 
but fail to display spontaneous emo- 
tional expressions involving the facial 
musculature contralateral to the lesion. 
These two systems are diagrammed in 
Figure C.

the facial muscles. (2) Bilateral electrical stimulation of the zygomaticus major mimicked a 
genuine expression of happiness, although closer examination shows insufficient contrac- 
tion of the obicularis oculi (surrounding the eyes) compared to spontaneous laughter (3). 
In photograph (4), stimulation of the brow and neck produced an expression of "terror 
mixed with pain, torture ... that of the damned"; however, the subject reported no 
discomfort or emotional experience consistent with the evoked contractions.

standing on end"), sweating, and gastrointestinal motil- 
ity all can accompany various emotions. These responses 
are brought about by changes in the activation of sympa- 
thetic, parasympathetic, and enteric components of the vis- 
ceral motor system, which govern smooth muscle, cardiac 
muscle, and glands throughout the body. As discussed in 
Chapter 21, Walter Cannon argued that intense activity of 
the sympathetic division prepares the animal to fully utilize 
metabolic and other resources in challenging or threatening 
situations. Conversely, activity of the parasympathetic and

enteric divisions promote a buildup of metabolic reserves. 
Cannon further suggested that the natural opposition of the 
expenditure versus the storage of resources is reflected in 
a parallel opposition of the emotions associated with these 
different physiological states, pointing out that "The desire 
for food and drink, the relish of taking them, all the plea- 
sures of the table are naught in the presence of anger or 
great anxiety." 
Activation of the visceral motor system, particularly 
the sympathetic division, was long considered to be an

CHAPTER 29 
all-or-nothing process. Once effective stimuli engaged the 
system, it was argued, a widespread discharge of all of its 
components ensued. More recent studies have shown that 
the responses of the autonomic nervous system are actually 
quite specific, with different patterns of activation charac- 
terizing different situations and their associated emotional 
states. Indeed, emotion-specific expressions produced vol- 
untarily can elicit distinct patterns of autonomic activity. For 
example, if subjects are given muscle-by-muscle instruc- 
tions that result in facial expressions recognizable as anger, 
disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or surprise without being 
told which emotion they are simulating, each pattern of 
facial muscle activity is accompanied by specific and repro- 
ducible differences in visceral motor activity (as measured 
by indices such as heart rate, skin conductance, and skin 
temperature). Moreover, autonomic responses are stron- 
gest when the facial expressions are judged to most closely 
resemble actual emotional expression and are often accom- 
panied by the subjective experience of that emotion. One 
interpretation of these findings is that when voluntary facial 
expressions are produced, signals in the brain engage not 
only the motor cortex but also some of the circuits that pro- 
duce emotional states. Perhaps this relationship helps ex- 
plain how good actors can be so convincing. Nevertheless, 
we are quite adept at recognizing the difference between a 
contrived facial expression and the spontaneous smile that 
accompanies a pleasant emotional state (Box 29A). 
This evidence, along with many other observations, in- 
dicates that one (but certainly not the only) source of emo- 
tion is sensory drive from muscles and internal organs. This 
input forms the sensory limb of reflex circuitry that allows 
rapid physiological changes in response to altered condi- 
tions. However, physiological responses can also be elic- 
ited by complex and idiosyncratic stimuli mediated by the 
forebrain. For example, an anticipated tryst with a lover, 
a suspenseful episode in a novel or film, stirring patriotic 
or religious music, or dishonest accusations can all lead to 
autonomic activation and strongly felt emotions. The neu- 
ral activity evoked by such complex stimuli is relayed from 
the forebrain to visceral and somatic motor nuclei via the 
hypothalamus and brainstem reticular formation, the major

structures that coordinate the expression of emotional be- 
havior (see the next section). 
In brief, emotion and sensorimotor behavior are inextri- 
cably linked. As William James put it more than a century 
ago: 
What kind of an emotion of fear would be left if the 
feeling neither of quickened heart-beats nor of shallow 
breathing, neither of trembling lips nor of weakened 
limbs, neither of goose-flesh nor of visceral stirrings, 
were present, it is quite impossible for me to think ... I 
say that for us emotion dissociated from all bodily feeling 
is inconceivable. 
William James, 1893 (Psychology: p. 379.) 
The Integration of 
Emotional Behavior 
In 1928, Phillip Bard reported the results of a series of experi- 
ments that pointed to the hypothalamus as a critical center 
for coordination of both the visceral and somatic motor com- 
ponents of emotional behavior (see Box 21A). Bard removed 
both cerebral hemispheres (including the cortex, underlying 
white matter, and basal ganglia) in a number of cats. When 
the anesthesia had worn off, the animals behaved as if they 
were enraged. The angry behavior occurred spontaneously 
and included the usual autonomic correlates of this emo- 
tion: increased blood pressure and heart rate, retraction of 
the nictitating membranes (the thin connective tissue sheets 
associated with feline eyelids), dilation of the pupils, and 
erection of the hairs on the back and tail. The cats also ex- 
hibited somatic motor components of anger, such as arch- 
ing their backs, extending their claws, lashing their tails, and 
snarling. This behavior was called sham rage because it had 
no obvious target. Bard showed that a complete response oc- 
curred as long as the caudal hypothalamus was intact (Figure 
29.1). Sham rage could not be elicited, however, when the 
brain was transected at the junction of the hypothalamus and 
midbrain (although some uncoordinated components of the 
response were still apparent). Bard suggested that, whereas 
the subjective experience of emotion might depend on an 
FIGURE 29.1 
Brain regions sufficient for

The illustration is a midsagittal view of a cat's 
brain. (A) Transection through the midbrain, 
disconnecting the hypothalamus and brain- 
stem, abolishes "sham rage." (B) The integrated

spheres as long as the caudal hypothalamus 
remains intact. (After LeDoux, 1987.) 

intact cerebral cortex, the expression of coordinated emo- 
tional behaviors does not necessarily entail cortical processes. 
He also emphasized that emotional behaviors are often di- 
rected toward self-preservation (a point made by Charles 
. Darwin in his classic book on the evolution of emotion), and 
that the functional importance of emotions in all mammals 
is consistent with the involvement of phylogenetically older 
parts of the nervous system. 
Complementary results were reported by Walter Hess, 
who showed that electrical stimulation of discrete sites 
in the hypothalamus of awake, freely moving cats could 
also lead to a rage response, and even to subsequent at- 
tack behavior. Moreover, stimulation of other sites in the 
hypothalamus caused a defensive posture that resembled 
fear. In 1949, a share of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or 
Medicine was awarded to Hess "for his discovery of the 
functional organization of the interbrain [hypothalamus] 
as a coordinator of the activities of the internal organs." Ex- 
periments like those of Bard and Hess led to the important 
conclusion that the basic circuits for organized behaviors 
accompanied by emotion are in the diencephalon and the 
brainstem structures connected to it. Furthermore, their 
work emphasized that the control of the involuntary mo- 
tor system is not entirely separable from the control of the 
voluntary pathways—an important consideration in under- 
standing the motor aspects of emotions. 
The routes by which the hypothalamus and other fore- 
brain structures influence the visceral and somatic motor 
EMOTIONS 
651 
systems are complex. The major targets of the hypothalamus 
lie in the reticular formation, a tangled web of nerve cells 
and fibers in the core of the brainstem (see Box 17D). This 
structure contains over 100 identifiable cell groups, includ- 
ing some of the nuclei that control the brain states associ- 
ated with sleep and wakefulness described in Chapter 28. 
Other important circuits in the reticular formation control 
cardiovascular function, respiration, urination, vomiting, 
and swallowing. The reticular neurons receive hypothalamic 
input from and provide output to both somatic and visceral 
motor effector systems in the brainstem and spinal cord. 
Their activity can therefore produce widespread visceral 
motor and somatic motor responses, often overriding reflex 
function and sometimes involving almost every organ in the 
body (as implied by Cannon's dictum about the sympathetic 
preparation of the animal for fight or flight). 
In addition to the hypothalamus, other sources of de- 
scending projections from the forebrain to the brainstem 
reticular formation contribute to the expression of emo- 
tional behavior. Collectively, these additional centers in the 
forebrain are considered part of the limbic system, which 
is described in the following section. These descending in- 
fluences on the expression of somatic and visceral motor 
behavior arise outside of the classic motor cortical areas 
in the posterior frontal lobe. Thus, the descending control 
of emotional expression entails two parallel systems that 
are anatomically and functionally distinct (Figure 29.2). 
The voluntary motor component, described in detail in

components that account for volitional somatic

centers in the ventral-medial forebrain and 
hypothalamus also give rise to medial and 
lateral descending projections. For both voli- 
tional movement and emotional expression, 
the lateral pathways elicit specific behaviors 
(e.g., volitional digit movements and emotional 
facial expressions), while the medial pathways 
support and modulate the execution of such 
behaviors. The descending projections of both 
systems terminate in several integrative centers

CHAPTER 29 
Chapters 16-20, comprises the classical motor areas of the 
posterior frontal lobe and related circuitry in the basal gan- 
glia and cerebellum. The descending pyramidal and extra- 
pyramidal projections from the motor cortex and brainstem 
ultimately convey the impulses responsible for voluntary 
somatic movements. In addition to the descending sys- 
tems that govern volitional movements, several cortical 
and subcortical structures in the medial frontal lobe and 
ventral parts of the forebrain, including neural circuits in 
the ventral part of the basal ganglia and hypothalamus, 
give rise to separate descending projections that run paral- 
lel to the pathways of the volitional motor system. These 
descending projections of the medial and ventral forebrain 
terminate on visceral motor centers in the brainstem re- 
ticular formation, preganglionic autonomic neurons, and 
certain somatic premotor neuron pools that also receive 
projections from volitional motor centers. The two types 
of facial paresis illustrated in Box 29A underscore this dual 
nature of descending motor control. 
In short, the somatic and visceral activities associated 
with unified emotional behavior are mediated by the ac- 
tivity of both somatic and visceral motor neurons that in- 
tegrate parallel, descending inputs from a constellation of 
forebrain sources. The remainder of this chapter describes 
the organization and function of the forebrain centers that 
specifically govern the experience and expression of emo- 
tional behavior. 
The Limbic System 
Attempts to understand the effector systems that control 
emotional behavior have a long history. In 1937, James Pa- 
pez first proposed that specific brain circuits are devoted to 
emotional experience and expression (much as the occipi- 
tal cortex is devoted to vision, for instance). In seeking to 
understand what parts of the brain serve this function, he 
began to explore the medial aspects of the cerebral hemi- 
sphere. In 1878, Paul Broca used the term limbic lobe (le 
grand lobe limbique) to refer to the part of the cerebral cortex 
that forms a rim (limbus is Latin for rim) around the corpus 
callosum and diencephalon on the medial face of the hemi- 
spheres (Figure 29.3). Two prominent components of this 
region are the cingulate gyrus, which lies above the corpus 
callosum, and the parahippocampal gyrus, which lies in 
the medial temporal lobe. 
For many years, these two structures, along with the ol- 
factory bulbs, were thought to be concerned primarily with 
the sense of smell. Indeed, Broca considered the olfactory 
bulbs to be the principal source of input to the limbic lobe. 
Papez, however, speculated that the function of the limbic 
lobe might be more related to emotions. He knew from 
the work of Bard and Hess that the hypothalamus influ- 
ences the expression of emotion; he also knew (as everyone 
does) that emotions reach consciousness and that higher

The limbic lobe. The so-called limbic lobe 
includes the cortex on the medial aspect of the cerebral hemi- 
sphere that forms a rim ("limbus") around the corpus callosum 
and diencephalon, including the cingulate gyrus (lying above the 
corpus callosum) and the parahippocampal gyrus. Historically, the 
olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex (not illustrated here) have also 
been considered to be important elements of the limbic lobe. 
cognitive functions affect emotional behavior. Ultimately, 
Papez showed that the cingulate cortex and hypothalamus 
are interconnected via projections from the mammillary 
bodies (part of the posterior hypothalamus) to the anterior 
nucleus of the thalamus, which projects in turn to the cin- 
gulate gyrus; the cingulate gyrus (like many other cortical 
regions) projects to the hippocampus. Finally, he showed 
that the hippocampus projects via the fornix (a large fiber 
bundle) back to the hypothalamus. Papez suggested that 
these pathways, which became known as the "Papez cir- 
cuit," provide the connections necessary for cortical control 
of emotional expression. 
Over time, the concept of a forebrain circuit for the 
control of emotional expression elaborated by Papez has 
been revised to include parts of the orbital and medial 
prefrontal cortex, ventral portions of the basal ganglia, 
the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (a different 
thalamic nucleus than the one Papez emphasized), and 
a large nuclear mass in the temporal lobe anterior to the 
hippocampus called the amygdala. This set of structures, 
together with the parahippocampal gyrus and cingulate 
cortex, is generally referred to as the limbic system (Figure 
29.4). Some of the structures that Papez originally described 
(the hippocampus, for example) now appear to have little to 
do with emotional behavior, whereas the amygdala, which 
Papez hardly mentioned, clearly plays a major role in the 
experience and expression of emotion (Box 29B).

FIGURE 29.4 A modern conception of the limbic sys- 
tem. Two especially important components of the limbic 
system not emphasized in early accounts are the orbital 
and medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. These two 
telencephalic regions, together with related structures 
in the thalamus, hypothalamus and ventral striatum, are 
especially important in the experience and expression of 
emotion (green). Other parts of the limbic system, includ- 
ing the hippocampus and the mammillary bodies of the 
hypothalamus, are no longer considered critical neural 
centers for processing emotion (blue).

About the same time that Papez proposed that 
these structures were important for the integration

Bucy were carrying out a series of experiments on 
@*t 
rhesus monkeys in which they removed a large 
part of both medial temporal lobes, thus destroy- 
ing much of the limbic system. They reported a 
set of abnormal behaviors in these animals that 
is now known as the Kitiver-Bucy syndrome (Box 
Anterior 
29C). Among the most prominent changes was 
'COommussure 
visual agnosia—the animals seemed unable to 
recognize objects, although they were not blind; 
this deficit is similar to that sometimes seen in 
human patients following lesions of the inferior 
temporal cortex (see Chapter 26). In addition, the 
ganglia 
monkeys displayed bizarre oral behaviors, put- 
ting objects into their mouths that normal mon- 
keys would not. They exhibited hyperactivity and 
hypersexuality, approaching and making physical 
Hypothalamus 
contact with virtually anything in their environ- 
ment; most importantly, they showed marked 
changes in emotional behavior. Because they had 
Optic chiasm 
been caught in the wild, the monkeys had typically 
reacted with hostility and fear to humans before 
their surgery. Postoperatively, however, they were 
virtually tame. Motor and vocal reactions gener- 
ally associated with anger or fear were no longer elicited 
by the approach of humans, and the animals showed little 
or no excitement when the experimenters handled them. 
Nor did they show fear when presented with a snake— 
a strongly aversive stimulus for a normal rhesus monkey. 
Kliiver and Bucy concluded that this remarkable change in 
behavior was at least partly due to the interruption of the 
pathways described by Papez. A similar syndrome has been 
described in humans who have suffered bilateral damage 
of the temporal lobes. When it was later demonstrated that 
the emotional disturbances of the Kliiver-Bucy syndrome 
could be elicited by removal of the amygdala alone, atten- 
tion turned more specifically to the role of this structure in 
the control of emotional behavior.

The Importance of the Amygdala 
Experiments performed in the late 1950s by John Downer 
at University College London vividly demonstrated the im- 
portance of the amygdala in aggressive behavior. Downer 
removed one amygdala in rhesus monkeys, at the same 
time transecting the optic chiasm and the commissures that 
link the two hemispheres (principally the corpus callosum 
and anterior commissure; see Chapter 27). In so doing, he 
produced animals with a single amygdala that had access 
only to visual inputs from the eye on the same side of the 
head. Downer found that the animals' behavior depended 
on which eye was used to view the world. Monkeys who 
could see only with the eye on the side of amygdala lesion 
behaved in some respects like those described by Kltiver

CHAPTER 29 
BOX 29B The Anatomy of the Amygdala 
The amygdala is a complex mass of gray 
ventral and medial aspect of the hemi- 
_ matter buried in the anterior-medial 
_ portion of the temporal lobe, just ros- 
_ tral to the hippocampus (Figure A). It 
- comprises multiple, distinct subnuclei 
and cortical regions that are richly con- 
- nected to nearby cortical areas on the

spheric surface. 
The amygdala (or amygdaloid com- 
plex, as it is often called) can best be 
thought of in terms of three major 
functional and anatomical subdivisions, 
each of which has a unique set of con- 
nections with other parts of the brain 
(Figures B and C). The medial group 
of subnuclei has extensive connections 
with the olfactory bulb and the olfac- 
tory cortex. The basal-lateral group, 
which is especially large in humans, 
has major connections with the cere- 
bral cortex, especially the orbital and 
medial prefrontal cortex of the frontal 
lobe and the associational cortex of the

anterior temporal lobe. The central and 
anterior group of nuclei is characterized 
by connections with the hypothalamus 
and brainstem, including such visceral 
sensory structures as the nucleus of 
the solitary tract and the parabrachial 
nucleus (see Chapter 21). 
The amygdala thus links cortical 
regions that process sensory informa- 
tion with hypothalamic and brainstem 
effector systems. Cortical inputs pro- 
vide information about highly pro- 
cessed visual, somatic sensory, visceral 
sensory, and auditory stimuli. These 
pathways from sensory cortical areas 
distinguish the amygdala from the 
hypothalamus, which receives relatively 
unprocessed sensory inputs. The amyg- 
dala also receives sensory input directly 
from some thalamic nuclei, the olfac- 
tory bulb, and visceral sensory relays in 
the brainstem. Thus, many neurons in 
the amygdala respond to visual, audi- 
tory, somatic sensory, visceral sensory, 
gustatory, and olfactory stimuli. 
Physiological studies have confirmed 
this convergence of sensory informa- 
tion. Moreover, highly complex stimuli 
are often required to evoke a neuro- 
nal response. For example, there are 
neurons in the basal-lateral group of 
nuclei that respond selectively to the 
sight of faces, very much like the "face" 
neurons in the inferior temporal cortex 
(see Chapter 26). In addition to sensory 
inputs, the prefrontal and temporal 
prefrontal cortex

(C) The amygdala (specifically, the basal-lateral group of nuclei) 
participates in a "triangular" circuit linking the amygdala, the tha- 
lamic mediodorsal nucleus (directly and indirectly via the ventral 
parts of the basal ganglia), and the orbital and medial prefrontal 
cortex. These complex interconnections allow direct interactions 
between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, as well as indirect 
modulation via the circuitry of the ventral basal ganglia.

and Bucy (for example, they were relatively placid in the 
presence of humans). If, however, they saw only with the 
eye on the side of the intact amygdala, they reverted to 
their normal fearful and often aggressive behavior. Thus, 
in the absence of the amygdala, a monkey does not inter- 
pret the significance of the visual stimulus presented by an 
approaching human in the same way as a normal animal. 
Importantly, only visual stimuli presented to the eye on the 
side of the ablation produced this abnormal state; thus if the 
animal was touched on either side, a full aggressive reaction 
occurred, implying that somatic sensory information about 
both sides of the body had access to the remaining amyg- 
dala. These anecdotal data, taken together with what is now

in both experimental animals and humans, show that the 
amygdala mediates neural processes that invest sensory ex- 
perience with emotional significance. 
To better understand the role of the amygdala in evaluat- 
ing stimuli, and to define more precisely the specific circuits 
and mechanisms involved, several other animal models of 
emotional behavior have been developed. One of the most 
useful is based on conditioned fear response in rats. Con- 
ditioned fear develops when an initially neutral stimulus is 
repeatedly paired with an inherently aversive one. Over time, 
the animal begins to respond to the neutral stimulus with 
behaviors similar to those elicited by the threatening stimulus 
(i.e., it has learned to attach a new meaning to the neutral 
stimulus). Joseph LeDoux and his colleagues at

BOX 29C The Reasoning Behind an Important Discovery* 
Paul Bucy explains why he and 
Heinrich Kliiver removed the temporal 
lobes in monkeys: 
When we started out, we were not 
trying to find out what removal of 
the temporal lobe would do, or what 
changes in behavior of the monkeys 
it would produce. What we found out 
was completely unexpected! Heinrich 
had been experimenting with mes- 
caline. He had even taken it himself 
and had experienced hallucinations. 
He had written a book about mes- 
caline and its effects. Later Heinrich 
gave mescaline to his monkeys. He 
gave everything to his monkeys, 
even his lunch! He noticed that the 
monkeys acted as though they experi- 
enced paraesthesias in their lips. They 
licked, bit and chewed their lips. So 
he came to me and said, "Maybe we 
can find out where mescaline has its 
actions in the brain." So I said, "OK." 
We began by doing a sensory 
denervation of the face, but that 
didn't make any difference to the 
mescaline-induced behavior. So we 
tried motor denervation. That didn't 
make any difference, either. Then we 
had to sit back and think hard about 
where to look. I said to Heinrich, 
"This business of licking and chewing 
the lips is not unlike what you see 
in cases of temporal lobe epilepsy. 
Patients chew and smack their lips 
inordinately. So, let's take out the 
uncus." Well, we could just as well 
take out the whole temporal lobe, 
including the uncus, So we did. 
We were especially fortunate with 
our first animal. This was an older 
female.... She had become vicious— 
absolutely nasty. She was the most 
vicious animal you ever saw; it was 
dangerous to go near her. If she 
didn't hurt you, she would at least 
tear your clothing. She was the first 
animal on which we operated. I 
removed one temporal lobe.... The 
next morning my phone was ring- 
ing like mad. It was Heinrich, who 
asked, "Paul, what did you do to 
my monkey? She is tame!" Subse- 
quently, in operating on non-vicious 
animals, the taming effect was never 
so obvious. 
That stimulated our getting the 
other temporal lobe out as soon as 
we could evaluate her. When we 
removed the other temporal lobe, the 
whole syndrome blossomed.

Auditory

sensory pathways) 
FIGURE 29.5 
Pathways for the association of auditory 
and aversive somatic sensory stimuli. Information processed 
by the auditory centers in the rat brainstem is relayed to the 
auditory cortex via the medial geniculate nucleus (1). The amyg- 
dala receives auditory information indirectly via the auditory cor- 
tex (2) and directly from one subdivision of the medial geniculate 
(3). The amygdala also receives sensory information about other 
sensory modalities, including pain (4). Thus, the amygdala is in 
a position to associate diverse sensory inputs, leading to new 
behavioral and autonomic responses to stimuli that were previ- 
ously devoid of emotional content (5). 
University trained rats to associate a tone with a mildly aver- 
sive foot shock delivered shortly after onset of the sound. To 
assess the animals' responses, they measured blood pressure 
and the length of time the animals crouched without moving 
(a fearful reaction called " freezing"). Before training, the rats 
did not react to the tone, nor did their blood pressure change 
when the tone was presented. After training, however, the 
onset of the tone caused a marked increase in blood pres- 
sure and prolonged periods of behavioral freezing. Using 
this paradigm, LeDoux and his colleagues worked out the 
neural circuitry that established the association between the 
FIGURE 29.6 
Model of associative learning in the amyg- 
dala. Most neutral sensory inputs are relayed to principal neu- 
rons in the amygdala by projections from "higher order" sensory 
processing areas that represent objects (e.g., faces). If these sen- 
sory inputs depolarize amygdaloid neurons at the same time as 
inputs that represent other sensations with primary reinforcing 
value, then associative learning occurs by strengthening synaptic 
linkages between the previously neutral inputs and the neurons 
of the amygdala. The output of the amygdala then signals a vari- 
ety of integrative centers responsible for the somatic and visceral 
motor expression of emotion and the implementation of behav- 
ior relevant to seeking rewards and avoiding punishment. (After 
Rolls, 1999.) 
tone and fear (Figure 29.5). First, they demonstrated that the 
medial geniculate nucleus is necessary for the development 
of the conditioned fear response. This result is not surprising, 
since all auditory information that reaches the forebrain trav- 
els through the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus 
(see Chapter 13). They went on to show, however, that the 
responses were still elicited even if the connections between 
the medial geniculate and auditory cortex were severed, leav- 
ing only a direct projection between the medial geniculate 
and the basal-lateral group of nuclei in the amygdala. Fur- 
thermore, if the part of the medial geniculate that projects to 
the amygdala was also destroyed, the fear responses were 
abolished. Subsequent work in LeDoux's laboratory estab- 
lished that projections from the central group of nuclei in the 
amygdala to the midbrain reticular formation are critical in 
the expression of freezing behavior, while other projections 
from this nuclear group to the hypothalamus control the rise 
in blood pressure. 
Since the amygdala is a site where neural activity pro- 
duced by both tones and shocks can be processed, it is

reasonable to suppose that the amygdala is also the site 
where learning about fearful stimuli occurs. These results, 
among others, have led to the broader hypothesis that the 
amygdala participates in establishing associations between 
neutral sensory stimuli, such as a mild auditory tone or the 
sight of inanimate object in the environment, and other 
stimuli that have some primary reinforcement value (Fig- 
ure 29.6). The neutral sensory input can be stimuli in the

the special sensory afferent systems, or internal stimuli 
derived from activation of visceral sensory receptors. The

such as an aversive tastants, loud sounds, or painful me-

BOX 29D Fear and the Human Amygdala: A Case Study 
Studies of fear conditioning in rodents 
show that the amygdala plays a critical 
role in the association of an innocu- 
ous auditory tone with an aversive 
mechanical sensation. Does this finding 
imply that the human amygdala is simi- 
larly involved in the experience of fear 
and the expression of fearful behavior? 
Reports of one extraordinary patient 
spanning nearly two decades now 
support the idea that the amygdala is 
indeed a key brain center for the expe- 
rience of fear. 
The patient (S.M.) suffers from a 
rare, autosomal recessive condition 
called Urbach-Wiethe disease, a dis- 
order that causes bilateral calcification 
and atrophy of the anterior-medial tem- 
poral lobes. As a result, both of S.M.'s 
amygdalas are extensively damaged, 
with little or no detectable injury to the 
hippocampal formation or nearby tem- 
poral neocortex (Figure A). She has no 
motor or sensory impairment, and no 
notable deficits in intelligence, memory, 
or language function. However, when 
asked to rate the intensity of emotion in

fear in real-life situations? This ques- 
_ tion was addressed in a more recent 
_ study when S.M. consented to a series 
_ of challenges that most people would 
consider fear-provoking. First, S.M. 
was brought to an exotic pet store for 
an encounter with snakes and spiders. 
Contrary to the behavior of most non- 
_ specialists, and despite her assertion 
that she "hates" these creatures, S.M. 
showed an intense interest in handling 
even dangerous snakes and spiders, 
showing no signs of avoidance and an 
excessive degree of approach. Next, 
she enthusiastically led the investiga- 
tors and a small group of strangers 
through a "haunted house" that was 
professionally designed and staffed to 
provoke fearful behavior among the 
patrons. S.M. gave no evidence of ner- 
vousness, apprehension or fear; in fact, 
S.M. attempted to interact with the 
actors posing as "monsters," showing 
an unusual inclination to approach and 
touch them. Lastly, S.M. was asked to 
rate her experience of emotion while 
viewing a series of film segments, 
including a set of clips from films that 
induce intense fear in control subjects. 
Once again, S.M. seemed to experience 
no fear. Clearly, experiences designed 
to evoke fear have little effect on S.M., 
except to pique her curiosity and arouse 
her excitement in a manner similar to 
"the feeling she gets when riding a 
roller coaster." 
To complement this assessment 
of S.M.'s responses to unusual fear- 
provoking experiences, she was asked 
to self-assess her everyday emotional 
experiences over a 3-month period,

according to a set of randomly pre- 
sented terms that characterize emo- 
tion. The results indicated that S.M. 
has a rich emotional life that reflects 
the nuances and rhythms of emotion 
and mood that most people experience, 
with one remarkable exception: S.M. 
never reported experiencing fear (Figure 
C). Interestingly, the single term that 
received the highest rating over the 
sample period was "fearless," despite 
her profound lack of insight into the 
true nature of her condition.

ingly rare condition: focal bilateral 
amygdala degeneration and, conse- 
quently, a pervasive impairment in her 
capacity to experience fear. Studies of 
this remarkable individual implicate

and property; she has also experienced

amygdala and the consequences of its 
injury: "... [Without the amygdala, the 
evolutionary value of fear is lost."

Despite evidence for a genetic 
predisposition and an increasing 
understanding of the brain areas 
_ involved, the cause of these conditions 
remains unknown. The efficacy of a 
large number of drugs that influence 
catecholaminergic and serotonergic 
neurotransmission strongly implies 
that the basis of the disease(s) is ulti- 
mately neurochemical (see Figures 6.11 
and 6.13 for overviews of the projec- 
_ tions of these neural systems). The 
_ majority of patients can be effectively 
_ treated with one of a variety of drugs, 
_ including tricyclic antidepressants and 
/ monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Most 
successful are the drugs commonly 
known as selective serotonin reuptake 
_ 
inhibitors (SSRIs), which selectively 
_ block serotonin uptake without affect- 
_ ing the uptake of other neurotransmit- 
ters. Three such inhibitors—fluoxetine 
_ (Prozac®), sertraline (Zoloft®), and par- 
 oxetine (Paxil®)—are especially effec- 
_ 
tive in treating depression and have 
few of the side effects of the older, less 
specific drugs. Perhaps the best indica- 
_ tor of the success of SSRIs has been 
their wide acceptance: although the 
_ 
first of these drugs were approved for 
clinical use only in the late 1980s, they 
_ 
are now among the most prescribed 
pharmaceuticals. Interestingly, there 
is now evidence suggesting that SSRIs 
modulate neurogenesis in the hip- 
~ 
pocampus (see Chapter 25), an effect 
that parallels the time course of clinical 
efficacy from the onset of treatment. 
This fact raises the possibility that hip- 
pocampal neurogenesis may contribute 
in a significant way to the clinical ben- 
efit of SSRI administration, in addition 
to whatever direct modulatory role 
the drugs may have on serotonergic 
neurotransmission. 
Most depressed patients who use 
SSRIs report that they lead fuller lives 
and are more energetic and organized. 
Based on such information, these drugs 
are sometimes used not only to combat 
depression but also to "treat" individu- 
als who have-no definable psychiatric 
disorder. This abuse raises important 
social questions similar to those posed 
by Aldous Huxley in his 1932 novel, in 
which the mythical drug "Soma" is rou- 
tinely administered to the inhabitants of 
his fictitious Brave New World to keep 
them content and docile. Presumably 
there is a middle ground between 
excessive suffering and excessive tran- 
quility. Such middle ground must also 
| 
accommodate longstanding interven- 
tions such as cognitive behavioral 
therapy and electroconvulsive shock 
treatment, as well as newer aproaches, 
which include deep brain stimulation of 
components of the limbic loop connect- 
ing medial prefrontal cortex to circuitry 
in the basal ganglia (see Box 18C).

The Relationship between 
Neocortex and Amygdala 
As these observations on the limbic system (and the amyg- 
dala in particular) make plain, understanding the neural 
basis of emotions requires understanding the role of the 
cerebral cortex. In animals like the rat, most behavioral re- 
sponses are highly stereotyped. In more complex brains, 
however, individual experience is increasingly influential 
in determining responses to special and even idiosyncratic 
stimuli. Thus, a sensory experience that evokes fear or 
sadness in one person may have little or no effect on the 
emotions of another. Although the pathways underlying 
such responses are not well understood, the amygdala and 
its interconnections with an array of neocortical areas, as 
well as several subcortical structures, appears to be espe- 
cially important in the higher order processing of emotion. 
In addition to its connections with the hypothalamus and 
brainstem centers that regulate visceral motor function, the 
amygdala has significant connections with several cortical 
areas in the orbital and medial aspects of the frontal lobe 
(see Box 29B). These prefrontal cortical fields associate in- 
formation from every sensory modality (including infor- 
mation about visceral activities) and can thus integrate a 
variety of inputs pertinent to moment-to-moment experi- 
ences. In addition, the amygdala projects to the thalamus 
(specifically, to the mediodorsal nucleus), which projects in 
turn to these same cortical areas. Finally, the amygdala in- 
nervates neurons in the ventral portions of the basal ganglia 
that receive the major corticostriatal projections from those 

regions of the prefrontal cortex thought to process emo- 
tions. Considering all these seemingly arcane anatomical 
connections, the amygdala emerges as a key node in a net- 
work that links together the cortical and subcortical brain 
regions involved in emotional processing. 
Clinical evidence concerning the significance of the cir- 
cuitry linked through the amygdala has come from func- 
tional imaging studies of patients suffering from depression 
(Box 29E), in which this set of interrelated forebrain struc- 
tures displays abnormal patterns of cerebral blood flow, es- 
pecially in the left hemisphere. More generally, the amyg- 
dala and its connections to the prefrontal cortex and basal 
ganglia are likely to influence the selection and initiation of 
behaviors aimed at obtaining rewards and avoiding pun- 
ishments (recall that the process of motor program selec- 
tion and initiation is an important function of basal ganglia 
circuitry; see Chapter 18). The parts of the prefrontal cortex 
interconnected with the amygdala are also involved in or- 
ganizing and planning future behaviors; thus, the amygdala 
may provide emotional input to overt (and covert) delibera- 
tions of this sort (see the later section on "Emotion, Reason, 
and Social Behavior"). 
Finally, it is likely that interactions between the amyg- 
dala, the neocortex and related subcortical circuits account 
for what is perhaps the most enigmatic aspect of emo- 
tional experience: the highly subjective "feelings" that at- 
tend most emotional states. Although the neurobiology of 
such experience is not understood, it is reasonable to as- 
sume that emotional feelings arise as a consequence of a 
more general cognitive capacity for self-awareness. In this 
conception, feelings entail both the immediate conscious 
experience of implicit emotional processing (arising from 
amygdala—neocortical circuitry) and the explicit processing 
of semantically based thought (arising from hippocam- 
pal-neocortical circuitry; see Chapter 31). Thus, feelings 
are plausibly conceived as the product of an emotional

working memory that sustains neural activity related to the 
processing of the various elements of emotional experience. 
Given the evidence for working memory functions in the 
prefrontal cortex (see Chapter 26), this portion of the frontal 
lobe—especially the orbital and medial sector—is the likely 
neural substrate where such associations are maintained in 
conscious awareness (Figure 29.7). 
Cortical Lateralization of 
Emotional Functions 
Since functional asymmetries of complex cortical processes 
are commonplace (see Chapters 26 and 27), it should come 
as no surprise that the two hemispheres make different 
contributions to the governance of emotion. Emotionality is 
lateralized in the cerebral hemispheres in at least two ways. 
First, as discussed in Chapter 27, the right hemisphere is es- 
pecially important for the expression and comprehension of 
the affective aspects of speech. Thus, patients with damage 
to the supra-Sylvian portions of the posterior frontal and 
anterior parietal lobes on the right side may lose the abil- 
ity to express emotion by modulation of their speech pat- 
terns (recall that this loss of emotional expression is referred 
to as aprosody or aprosodia, and that similar lesions in the 
left hemisphere give rise to Broca's aphasia. Patients with 
aprosodia tend to speak in a monotone, no matter what the 
circumstances or meaning of what is said. For example, one 
such patient, a teacher, had trouble maintaining discipline 
in the classroom. Because her pupils (and even her own 
children) couldn't tell when she was angry or upset, she 
had to resort to adding phrases such as "I am angry and 
I really mean it" to indicate the emotional significance of 
her remarks. The wife of another patient felt her husband 
no longer loved her because he could not imbue his speech 
with cheerfulness or affection. Although such patients can- 
not express emotion in speech, they nonetheless do experi- 
ence normal emotional feelings. 
A second way in which the hemispheric processing of 
emotionality is asymmetrical concerns mood. Both clinical 
and experimental studies indicate that the left hemisphere 
is more importantly involved with what can be thought of 
as positive emotions, whereas the right hemisphere is more

FIGURE 29.8 Asymmetrical smiles 
on some famous faces. Studies of 
normal subjects show that facial expres- 
sions are often more quickly and fully 
expressed by the left facial musculature 
than the right, as suggested by these 
examples (try covering one side of the 
faces and then the other). Since the 
left lower face is governed by the right 
hemisphere, some psychologists have 
suggested that most humans are "left- 
faced," in the same sense that most of 
us are right-handed. (Top row, left to

involved with negative ones. For example, the incidence 
and severity of depression (see Box 298) is significantly 
higher in patients with lesions of the left anterior hemi- 
sphere compared to any other location. In contrast, patients 
with lesions of the right anterior hemisphere are often de- 
scribed as unduly cheerful. These observations suggest 
that lesions in the left hemisphere result in a relative loss 
of positive feelings and thus facilitate depression, whereas 
lesions of the right hemisphere result in a loss of negative 
feelings, leading to inappropriate optimism. 
Hemispheric asymmetry related to emotion is also ap- 
parent in normal individuals. For instance, auditory experi- 
ments that introduce sound into one ear or the other indi- 
cate a right-hemisphere superiority in detecting emotional 
nuances in speech. Moreover, when facial expressions are 
specifically presented to either the right or the left visual 
hemifield, the depicted emotions are more readily and ac- 
curately identified from the information in the left hemifield 
(that is, the hemifield perceived by the right hemisphere; 
see Chapters 12 and 27). Finally, kinematic studies of facial 
expressions show that most individuals more quickly and 
fully express emotions with the left facial musculature than 
with the right (Figure 29.8; recall that the left lower face is 
controlled by the right hemisphere, and vice versa). Taken 
together, this evidence is consistent with the idea that the 
right hemisphere is more intimately concerned with both 
the perception and expression of emotions than is the left 
hemisphere. However, it is important to remember that, as 
in the case of other lateralized behaviors, both hemispheres 
participate in processing emotion. 
Emotion, Reason, and Social Behavior 
Even ona 
subconscious level, the experience of emotion has 
a powerful influence on other complex brain functions, in- 
cluding the neural faculties responsible for making rational 
decisions and the interpersonal judgments that guide social 
behavior. Evidence for this statement has come principally 
from studies of patients with damage to parts of the orbital 
and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as patients with injury or 
disease involving the amygdala (see Box 29D). Such patients 
often have impaired emotional processing, especially of the 
emotions engendered by complex personal and social situ- 
ations, and they have difficulty making advantageous deci- 
sions (see also Chapter 26). Adding to this body of evidence 
are results from brain imaging studies in normal subjects in 
which investigators have mapped the brain structures that 
participate in essential emotional and social appraisals. 
Antonio Damasio and his colleagues at the University of 
Iowa have suggested that such decision making entails the 
rapid evaluation of a set of possible outcomes with respect 
to the future consequences associated with each course of 
action. It seems plausible that the generation of conscious 
or subconscious mental images representing the conse- 
quences of each contingency triggers emotional states that 
involve either actual alterations of somatic and visceral mo- 
tor function, or the activation of neural representations of 
such activity. William James proposed that we are "afraid 
because we tremble." Damasio and his colleagues suggest 
that changes in somatic motor and/or visceral motor activity 
need not precede awareness of emotional processing in an 
obligatory sequence of events, as James's famous dictum 

implies. Rather, emotion may follow a vicarious represen- 
tation of motor action and sensory feedback in the neu- 
ral circuits of the frontal and parietal lobes, even if bodily 
changes are not evoked in full. Thus, fear may follow activa- 
tion of neural representations of bodily changes associated 
with past experience of fearful events, whether or not overt 
trembling occurs during or just preceding the current emo- 
tional experience. It is these vicarious states, according to 
Damasio, that give mental representations of contingencies 
the emotional valence that helps an individual to identify 
favorable or unfavorable outcomes. 
Experimental studies of fear conditioning have implied 
just such a role for the amygdala in associating sensory 
stimuli with aversive consequences. For example, the pa- 
tient described in Box 29D showed both impaired ability 
to recognize and experience fear and impairment in ra- 
tional decision making. Similar evidence of the emotional 
influences on decision making have come from studies of 
patients with lesions in the orbital and medial prefrontal 
cortex. These clinical observations suggest that the amyg- 
dala and prefrontal cortex, together with their striatal and 
thalamic connections, are not only involved in processing 
emotions, but also participate in the complex neural pro- 
cessing responsible for rational thinking. These same neural

networks are engaged by sensory stimuli (e.g., facial expres- 
sions) that convey important cues pertinent to appraising 
social circumstances and conventions. Thus, when judging 
the trustworthiness of human faces—a task of considerable 
importance for successful interpersonal relations—neural 
activity in the amygdala is specifically increased, especially 
when the face in question is deemed untrustworthy (Figure 
29.9). It is not surprising, then, that subjects with bilateral 
damage to the amygdala differ from control subjects in their 
appraisals of trustworthiness; indeed, individuals with such 
impairments often show inappropriately friendly behavior 
toward strangers in real-life social situations. Such evidence 
adds further weight to the idea that emotional processing 
is crucial for competent performance in a wide variety of 
complex brain functions. 
Emotional Reinforcement 
and Addiction 
Understanding the neurobiological basis of emotion and 
the contributions of affective neural processing to higher 
brain functions remains an important goal of neuroscience. 
'The urgency of achieving this goal is highlighted by the 
pervasiveness and consequence of drug abuse and addic- 
tion (see Box 6F). Addiction highlights the vulnerability of 
emotional neural circuits to dysregulation when they are 
exposed to drugs that misappropriate their normally adap- 
tive operations in guiding goal-directed behavior. Under 
normal physiological conditions, emotional processing in 
the limbic system can signal the presence of or prospect 
for reward and punishment, as well as promoting the ac- 
tivation of motor programs aimed at procuring beneficial 
rewards and avoiding punishment (see Figure 29.6). With 
this in mind, it is not surprising that most known drugs 
of abuse—including heroin, cocaine, alcohol, opiates,

Functional MRI imaging shows increased neu- 
ral activation bilaterally in the amygdala when 
normal subjects appraise the trustworthiness 
of human faces; activity is also increased in 
the right insular cortex. (B,C) The degree of 
activation is greatest when subjects evaluate 
faces that are considered untrustworthy (Low, 
Med and High indicate ratings of trustwor- 
thiness, with low being untrustworthy). The 
same effect was observed whether subjects 
were instructed to evaluate the trustworthi- 
ness of the faces (explicit condition) or the 
faces were those of high school or university 
students (implicit condition). (After Winston

marijuana, nicotine, amphetamines, and their synthetic 
analogs—act on elements of the limbic circuitry. What 
may be surprising is that such diverse natural and synthetic 
compounds act by altering the neuromodulatory influence 
of dopamine on the processing of reinforcement signals 
in the ventral divisions of the basal ganglia, which in turn 
leads to the consolidation of addictive behavior in limbic 
circuitry. To understand the neural mechanisms of addic- 
tion, then, it is necessary to return to the anatomy and 
physiology of the basal ganglia in the context of emotional 
reinforcement. 
Recall from Chapter 18 that the dorsal divisions of the 
basal ganglia (dorsal caudate, putamen, and globus pal- 
lidus) are instrumental in gating the activation of thala- 
mocortical circuits that initiate volitional movement. Also 
mentioned briefly in Chapter 18 is the existence of other, 
parallel, processing streams that similarly gate the activa- 
tion of non-motor programs, including those that pertain 
to cognition and affective processing (see the discussion of 
the "limbic loop" in Box 18D). The organization of these 
non-motor processing streams is fundamentally compa- 
rable to the "direct pathway" for volitional movement— 
there are major excitatory inputs from cortex to striatum, 
neuromodulatory projections from midbrain dopaminer- 
gic neurons to striatum, internuclear connections from

striatum to pallidum, and output projections from pallidum 
to thalamus. What distinguishes the limbic loop from the 
motor loop (discussed in detail in Chapter 18) is the source 
and nature of the cortical input, the relevant divisions of 
striatum and pallidum that processes this input, the source 
of dopaminergic projections from the midbrain, and the 
thalamic target of the pallidal output (Figure 29.10). 
Central to the organization and function of the limbic 
loop are inputs from the amygdala, the subiculum (a ventral 
division of the hippocampal formation), and orbital-medial 
prefrontal cortex. These inputs convey signals relevant to 
emotional reinforcement to ventral divisions of the anterior 
striatum, the largest component of which is the nucleus 
accumbens. Like the caudate and putamen, the nucleus 
accumbens contains medium spiny neurons that integrate 
excitatory telencephalic inputs under the modulatory influ- 
ence of dopamine. However, unlike the larger dorsal divi- 
sion of the striatum, the nucleus accumbens receives its do- 
paminergic projections from a collection of neurons that lies 
just dorsal and medial to the substantia nigra, in a region 
of the midbrain called the ventral tegmental area (VTA). 
The nucleus accumbens and the VTA are primary sites at 
which drugs of abuse interact with the processing of neu- 
ral signals related to emotional reinforcement; they do so 
either by prolonging the action of dopamine in the nucleus

interacting directly with dopamine syn-

Other drugs may act directly on accum- 
bens neurons to increase their respon- 
siveness to telencephalic input. (B) Drug 
addiction is associated with cellular and 
molecular adaptations of this circuit (see 
text for details).The net effect of addic- 
tion is a chronic decrease in the ongoing

nergic inputs, except for an increase in 
phasic activity during consumption of 
abusive drugs. (After Nestler, 2005.)

accumbens or by potentiating the activation of neurons in 
the VTA and nucleus accumbens (Figure 29.11). 
Under normal conditions (i.e., when drugs are absent), 
these dopaminergic neurons are only phasically active. 
When they do fire a barrage of action potentials, however, 
dopamine is released in the nucleus accumbens and me- 
dium spiny neurons are much more responsive to coinci- 
dent excitatory input from telencephalic structures such as 
the amygdala and orbital-medial prefrontal cortex. These 
activated striatal neurons in turn project to and inhibit palli- 
dal neurons in a region just below the globus pallidus called 
the ventral pallidum, as well as in the pallidal division of 
the substantia nigra (i.e., pars reticulata). The suppression 
of tonic activity in the pallidum then disinhibits the thalamic 
target of the limbic loop, which is the mediodorsal nucleus, 
the thalamic nucleus that innervates cortical divisions of 
the limbic forebrain (see Figure 29.4). Activation of these 
cortical regions via the mediodorsal nucleus are reinforced 
by direct cortical projections of dopaminergic neurons in 
the ventral tegmental area and glutamatergic projections 
from the basal-lateral group of nuclei in the amygdala that 
target these same regions (see Box 298).

Activation of these complex limbic circuits is believed to 
instantiate the rewarding effects of natural agents and ex- 
periences such as food, water, micturition, and sex, as well 
more complex social rewards. However, the phasic release of 
dopamine is also subject to experience-dependent plasticity 
in a manner consistent with classical conditioning. During 
associative learning, for example, the activity of VTA neu- 
rons comes to signal the presence of the reward-predicting 
stimulus with diminished responsiveness to the presence of 
the primary reward itself (Figure 29.12A,B). Interestingly, 
if a conditioned stimulus is not followed by reward deliv- 
ery (e.g., because of an inappropriate behavioral response 
in an instrumental learning paradigm), VTA neurons are 
suppressed at precisely the same time that the neuronal re- 
sponse would have signaled the presence of a reward (Figure 
29.12C). These observations indicate that the phasic release 
of dopamine signals the presence of reward relative to its 
prediction, rather than the unconditional presence of reward. 
The integration of such signals in the nucleus accumbens, 
orbital-medial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala leads to the 
activation of instrumental behaviors directed at obtaining 
and consolidating the benefits of the rewarding event.

Changes in the activity of dopamine neurons in 
(A) 
the VTA during stimulus-reward learning. In each panel of record- 
ings from an awake monkey, poststimulus time histograms (blue, 
above) and data plots (below) report summed activity across trials 
and individual spikes within trials, respectively. (A) Before learning, the 
presentation of an unexpected juice reward evokes a burst of activity 
(darker-shaded zone). (B) After learning trials, the neurons respond to 
the presentation of visual or auditory cues (conditioned stimuli), but 
not to the reward itself. (C) In trials when a reward was predicted but 
never delivered, dopaminergic neurons become suppressed (light- 
shaded zone) at the time when the reward would have been available. 
These results show that the ventral tegmental area signals the occur- 
(B) 
rence of reward relative to its prediction. (After Schultz et al., 1997.) 
Unfortunately, the plastic potential of these limbic cir- 
cuits can be co-opted by chronic exposure to drugs of abuse, 
leading to cellular and molecular changes that promote 
dysregulation (see Figure 29.11B). In the VTA of addicted 
individuals, the activity of the dopamine-synthesizing en- 
zyme tyrosine hydroxylase increases, as does the ability of 
these neurons to respond to excitatory inputs. The latter ef- 
fect is secondary to increases in the activity of the transcrip- 
tion factor CREB (see Chapter 7) and the upregulation of 
GluR1, an important subunit of AMPA receptors for gluta- 
mate (see Chapter 6). In the nucleus accumbens, addiction 
is characterized by increases in another transcription factor, 
AFosB, in addition to the induction of CREB activity with 
chronic exposure to at least some classes of addictive drugs. 
Activation of these molecular signaling pathways leads to a 
generalized reduction in the responsiveness of accumbens 
neurons to glutamate released by telencephalic inputs. This 
occurs by regulation of different AMPA receptor subunits 
and/or changes in the postsynaptic density of proteins that 
alter the dynamics of receptor trafficking. However, during 
the phasic release of dopamine, the responsiveness of these 
striatal neurons is intensified, mediated in part by a shift in 
the expression of D1 and D2 classes of dopamine receptors 
and a coordinated upregulation of cAMP-PKA signaling 
pathways. 
Clearly, the cellular and molecular maladaptations of 
ventral tegmental, striatal, and cortical neurons to chronic 
exposure of abusive drugs remains poorly understood. 
Nevertheless, the net effect of these and presumably other 
changes is becoming more clear: Addiction dampens the 
response of emotional reinforcement circuitry to less po- 
tent natural rewards, while intensifying the response to ad- 
dictive drugs. At a systems level, these changes are likely 
reflected in the "hypofrontality'—reduced baseline activ- 
ity in orbital-medial prefrontal cortex—commonly seen in 
human addicts. Taken together, these alterations in neural 
processing could account for the waning influence of adap- 
tive emotional signals on the operation of decision making 
faculties as drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors be- 
come habitual and compulsive.

Summary 
The word "emotion" covers a wide range of states that have 
in common the association of visceral motor responses, so- 
matic behavior, and powerful subjective feelings. The vis- 
ceral responses are mediated by the visceral motor system, 
which is itself regulated by inputs from many other parts 
of the brain, including components of the limbic system. 
Likewise, the organization of the somatic motor behavior 
associated with emotion is governed by circuits in the limbic 
system, principally the hypothalamus, the amygdala, and 
several regions of the cerebral cortex in the medial and in- 
ferior frontal lobe. Although a good deal is known about 
the neuroanatomy and transmitter chemistry of the differ- 
ent parts of the limbic system and how they are affected by 
drugs of abuse, there is still a dearth of information about 
how this complex circuitry mediates specific emotional 
states. Similarly, neuropsychologists, neurologists, and psy- 
chiatrists are only now coming to appreciate the important 

role of emotional processing in other complex brain func- 
tions, such as decision making and social behavior, A vari- 
ety of other evidence indicates that the two hemispheres are 
differently specialized for the governance of emotion, the 
right hemisphere being the more important in this regard. 
The prevalence and social significance of human emotions 
and their disorders ensure that the neurobiology of emo- 
tion will be an increasingly important theme in the brain 
sciences for the decades to come.

Overview 
BEHAVIORS THAT FACILITATE REPRODUCTION and parenting—including the 
recognition and selection of mates, sexual intercourse, reproduction, and the feed- 
ing and rearing of offspring—are essential to any organism. Thus it is not surprising 
that the nervous systems of all animals, including humans, are highly specialized to 
control these behaviors. For most animals, reproductive and parenting behaviors are 
unequally distributed between the two sexes. These differences include fundamental 
anatomical, behavioral, and neurobiological distinctions between females and males, 
a phenomenon referred to as sexual dimorphism. Some of these differences reflect 
the genetic mechanisms that establish first either male or female gonads (primary 
sex characteristics) and then the external genitalia and other physical characteristics 
(secondary sex characteristics) that distinguish the sexes. Corresponding differences 
in the central nervous system accommodate divergent reproductive and parenting 
functions. Beyond these clear sex differences lie behaviors, especially in humans, that 
are associated with sex but whose biological bases remain largely unknown. These 
behaviors include the range of emotions and choices that define human sexuality 
as well as measurable sensory, motor, and cognitive differences not strictly associ- 
ated with reproduction or parenting. The relationship between these sex- or gender- 
associated behavioral differences and the observable differences in the brains of 
males and females remains highly controversial. 
Sexual Dimorphisms and Sexually 
Dimorphic Behaviors 
Sexual dimorphisms—clear and consistent physical differences between females and 
males of the same species—are seen throughout the animal kingdom and are usu- 
ally associated with functional differences that facilitate reproduction or rearing of 
offspring. These physical differences are often recognized in peripheral structures 
found in one sex but not the other. Quite often, divergent neural circuits in female 
and male brains parallel differences in female and male bodies. For example, in the 
tobacco hawk moth, Manduca sexta, the female and male antennae are strikingly 
different in size and structure: the female antennae are small and smooth, while the

by dimorphism in the olfactory glomeruli

behaviors. The male-specific macroglomerular 
complex is essential for processing the female

potential mate. This physical dimorphism 
is matched by dimorphic circuitry in the 
brain. The antennae have olfactory recep- 
tor neurons whose axons project to glomerular structures in 
the antennal lobe (the equivalent of the vertebrate olfactory 
bulb; see Chapter 15), where the distinct organization of 
these glomeruli corresponds to the peripheral dimorphism 
(Figure 30.1B). The large glomeruli of male moths (referred 
to as the macroglomerular complex) have neural circuitry 
specialized for responses to female pheromone. Similar 
glomeruli in females are smaller, and their constituent cells 
respond more robustly to molecules released by tobacco 
plants. The development of these glomeruli depends on the 
antennae that project to it. Ifa male antenna is transplanted 
onto the head of a female at a late larval stage, a male mac- 
roglomerular complex develops in the female brain. 
Among the most thoroughly characterized sexual dimor- 
phisms of body, behavior, and brain are those of several 
songbird species in which males produce complex songs 
and females do not. A male's song is critical for attract- 
ing mates and establishing territorial dominion. It is also 
an important aspect of parenting: male hatchlings learn to 
sing from adult male "tutors" whose vocalizations they hear 
and mimic, thus determining their reproductive success. 
The peripheral structure that produces songs (the syrinx) is 
larger and more differentiated in male birds than in females. 
Accordingly, in the songbird brain, the nuclei that control 
motor as well as sensory aspects of song production via the 
syrinx are larger in males.

In all animals evaluated thus far—including humans— 
sexual dimorphism in the brain accords with peripheral dif- 
ferences in body structures. In both the body and the brain, 
many of these structural dimorphisms are under the control 
of circulating steroid hormones produced by the male and 
female gonads, particularly during development. Thus, fe- 
male songbirds treated with male-specific levels of gonadal 
steroids during development acquire a highly differentiated, 
hypertrophic syrinx. The song-control nuclei in their brains 
also become masculinized, and these female birds—mas- 
culinized in the periphery as well as in the brain—sing like 
their male counterparts. 
The relationships between brain and peripheral sexual 
dimorphism in Manduca sexta and in songbirds illustrate a 
fundamental concept in the neuroscience of sex differences: 
dimorphisms in body structure that are essential for repro- 
ductive and parenting behaviors are paralleled by distinct 
structures and circuits in the brain. For the nervous systems 
of moths, birds, and several other species, including hu- 
mans, these dimorphisms reflect differential growth that 
leads to divergent organization of brain structures that are 
nevertheless present in both sexes. 

Sex, Gonads, Bodies, and Brains 
The word "sex" has a broad range of meanings defined by 
culture, tradition, individual preferences, and biology. Chro- 
mosomal sex is a biological term that refers specifically to 
an individual's sex chromosomes. Most species have two 
types of chromosomes: autosomes, which are identical in 
the two sexes; and sex chromosomes, the number and/ 
or identity of which determine chromosomal sex. In some 
species, males have three copies of the sex chromosomes, 
whereas females have only two. In others, including hu- 
mans, there are distinct chromosomal identities; most com- 
monly, a male-specific chromosome is present or absent. 
Not surprisingly, the genes critical for the definition 
of primary sex characteristics—the gonadal tissues that 
support either male and female gametes—are found on sex 
chromosomes. The physical state of the gonads and exter- 
nal genitalia is the primary determinant of phenotypic sex. 
A range of secondary sex characteristics further defines 
an individual's phenotypic sex; these include mammary 
glands in females, sex-specific hair patterns in males and 
females, and musculoskeletal as well as organismal size 
differences. These phenotypic characteristics are more or 
less related to distinct reproductive and 
parenting functions in females or males 
and are primarily regulated by hormonal 
A) 
secretions from the gonads. 
In humans, the letters X and Y identify 
the sex chromosomes (in contrast with the 
22 pairs of autosomes, which are identi- 
fied by numbers). With few exceptions 
(see the discussion of intersex conditions, 
p. 687), individuals with two X chromo- 
somes are female, while those with one X 
and one Y chromosome are male (Figure 
30.2A). The correlations between human 
genotype (i.e., chromosomal sex) and phe- 
notype (i.e., phenotypic sex) for primary 
sex characteristics are best understood 
for the male genotype, XY. The defining 
gene for male genotypic and phenotypic 
sex is found on the Y chromosome and 
is a single gene for a transcription factor 
FIGURE 30.2 
Chromosomal sex and primary sex determination 
in humans. (A) The SRY gene, located on the short arm of the Y chro- 
mosome, initiates a cascade of gene expression and hormonal signaling 
that results in masculinization of human genitalia. (B) The genitalia of 
the early human embryo (weeks 4-7 of gestation) are sexually indif- 
ferent. Under the influence of SRY gene product, testes develop and 
produce hormones that result in male genitalia (left diagrams) between 
the ninth and twelfth weeks of gestation. Without the influence of the 
Y chromosome and its SRY gene, the human gonads become ovaries, 
whose hormonal cascade results in female external genitalia (right). 
SEX, SEXUALITY, AND THE BRAIN

known as testis-determining factor (TDF) or SRY. This 
gene is commonly called SRY (an acronym for sex reversal 
on the Y chromosome), a reference to how the gene was 
first identified. Remarkably, the TDF/SRY gene product is 
the sole determinant for establishing male gonadal tissues, 
and thus male phenotypic sex. 
In most instances, the XY genotype leads to a phenotype 
with testicles, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, pe- 
nis, and scrotum; the XX genotype results in the develop- 
ment of ovaries, oviducts, uterus, cervix, clitoris, labia, and 
vagina (Figure 30.2B). Rare apparently male individuals (and 
mutant mice, in which the Sry gene was first cloned and se- 
quenced) have two X chromosomes, but one of these carries 
a translocated SRY gene (transferred to the paternal X chro- 
mosome from the paternal Y chromosome during meiotic 
recombination). Despite the overwhelming majority of dual 
copies of X chromosome genes in these individuals (and the 
corresponding lack of any additional Y genes), SRY alone 
is sufficient to completely masculinize them, and they be- 
come phenotypic males. In fact, whether SRY is translocated 
as an individual gene or is transferred to an XX individual 
along with the entire Y chromosome (resulting in an aneu- 
ploid XXY phenotype known as Kleinfelter's syndrome; see

below), the result is the same—a phenotypic male. Other 
rare individuals carry a deletion of SRY on an otherwise in- 
tact Y chromosome and are phenotypic females. SRY is thus 
believed to be at the apex of a genetic network that mediates 
the differentiation of male primary and secondary sex char- 
acteristics (see Figure 30.2B). The genetic details of gonadal 
and secondary sex characteristic specification are crucial for 
brain development because, as described in detail below, the 
organization of female versus male brains depends in large 
measure on the gonadal tissue and peripheral genitalia. Sur- 
prisingly, however, SRY is not expressed in the brain. As is 
true for songbirds and Manduca moths, sexual dimorphisms 
in the male and female human brains arise secondarily, in 
response to primary peripheral distinctions. 
This biological account of genotypic and phenotypic sex, 
while compelling, does not explain the full range of cognitive, 
emotional, and cultural experiences that humans recognize 
as part of sex (Box 30A). Accordingly, additional vocabulary 
is needed to describe various facets of human sexuality. The 
phrase sexual identity is used to describe an individual's 
conscious perception of his or her phenotypic sex. Sexual 
orientation refers to the cognitive experience of emotions 
and attractions that are associated with sexual relationships. 
Sexual orientation is not simply coordinated with obvious 
genotypic, phenotypic, or gender-associated characteris- 
tics—homosexual women are not phenotypically masculin- 
ized, nor are homosexual men phenotypically feminized. 
Although the evidence indicates that sexual orientation is 
BOX 30A The Science of Love (or, Love Is a Drug) 
biologically established, it nevertheless entails self-appraisal 
and declaration in a social and cultural context. 
Gender, which refers to an individual's subjective per- 
ception of their sex and their sexual orientation is harder to 
define—especially in strict biological terms—than chromo- 
somal or phenotypic sex, or even sexual identity and orien- 
tation. Indeed, many people consider gender to be a social 
and political construct rather than a biologically constrained 
phenomenon. Clinical studies of transgendered individu- 
als, however, challenge this view. These individuals report 
deeply held identities that oppose their genotypic and phe- 
notypic sex. Their experiences, usually thoroughly assessed 
in rigorous diagnostic evaluation, often lead to hormonal 
and surgical reassignment of phenotypic sex. Current un- 
derstanding of transgendered men and women thus rein- 
forces a sense that an individual's perception of their sex 
and sexuality—their gender—has some biological com- 
ponents. Regardless of its biological basis, gender entails 
self-assessment based on affinity for complex behavioral 
traits most often associated with one sex or the other. Such 
gender traits do not necessarily directly affect reproduction 
and parenting; they include the entire catalog of behaviors 
and skills that females or males are arguably either more 
or less "interested in" or "better suited for." While such 
distinctions remain poorly understood (and in many cases 
the source of great controversy), they are likely influenced 
by societal expectations and cultural norms as well as (or 
even instead of) by biology. 
For much of recorded history, romantic 
love has been the province of poets, 
painters and musicians. Scientists, it 
seemed, had little to add—and perhaps 
it was feared that scientists might steal 
the mystery from this most intoxicating 
of human experiences. Nevertheless, 
over the past decade, neuroscientists 
have added their interpretation to 
the countless couplets, cupids, and 
cantatas that celebrate coupling. The 
results seem to confirm the suspicions 
of recent popular songwriters and rock 
stars that love may actually be a drug. 
Beyond inspiring poetry, paintings, 
and catchy song lyrics, the biological 
purpose of romantic love seems to be 
to enhance and reinforce mate selection 
and bonding for maximal parental effec- 
tiveness. Thus, the brain systems that 
are the most engaged by "being in love" 
are also associated with reward and 
reinforcement—the very same systems 
that are activated, often with disastrous 
consequences, by alcohol and drugs. In 
addition, in humans, the state of roman- 
tic love (and also maternal love) relies 
on the activity of two peptide hormone 
neurotransmitters, oxytocin and vaso- 
pressin, that are associated with social 
recognition and maternal—offspring 
bonding in diverse species, regardless 
of whether monogamy and romantic 
love (or its biological counterpart, pair 
bonding) are part of the behavioral 
repertoire. Finally, when a person is in 
love, the brain regions that normally 
regulate social interactions—especially 
those in the cerebral cortex and basal 
forebrain that enhance social vigilance 
and caution—are diminished in activity. 
Thus, love may actually be "blind" to 
the behavioral cues that in other social 
encounters would inspire caution. 
Monogamy and pair bonding were 
the first behaviors related to romantic 
love to be understood biologically. 
These two behaviors emerge in a few 
mammalian species, including the 
prairie vole Microtus ochrogaster. Prairie 
voles bond with a single mate and 
remain monagomous (with the occa- 
sional exception of a few flings) for life. 
In contrast, individuals of the closely 
related species Microtus montanus 
(montane voles) are promiscuous and 
do not form lifelong mating pairs. It 
turns out that these differences in mate 
selection and preference are matched 
by differences in the distribution of 
oxcytocin and vasopressin receptors in 
the nucleus accumbens, caudate/puta- 
men, and ventral pallidum (Figures 
A,B)—all regions that are associated 
with reward, reinforcement, and addic- 
tive behaviors (see Chapter 29). These

The contributions of the nucleus

and its dopaminergic innevation from 
the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have 
led to a clear hypothesis for study- 
ing human romantic love: individuals 
newly in love should have elevated 
brain activity in all of these regions in 
response to considering or seeing the 
object of their affections versus neutral 
stimuli. Indeed, when male and female

(A) Prairie voles (left), who form lifelong 
mating pair bonds, have a high density of 
oxytocin receptors in the nucleus accum- 
bens (NAcc), caudate putamen (CP), and 
prefrontal cortex (PFC), all associated with 
reward and reinforcement. Promiscuous 
montane voles (right) lack a high density 
of receptors in the NAcc and CP. (B) Male 
prairie voles (left) have enhanced density 
of vasopressin receptors in their ventral 
pallidum (VP, part of the striatum), and 
lateral septal nuclei (LS). In the montane 
vole (right), there is a high density of 
receptors in the LS, but the density is 
diminished in the VP. (C) Normal male 
prairie voles (left) presented with their 
pair-bonded partner versus a stranger 
prefer to mate with the partner, based on 
the amount of time spent in contact. If a 
vasopressin antagonist is infused into the 
ventral pallidum, this preference dimin- 
ishes substantially. Normal female prairie 
voles (right) also prefer to mate with their 
pair-bonded partner; however, if a dopa- 
mine antagonist is infused into the NAcc, 
this preference is decreased. (From Young 
and Wang, 2004.) 
versus images friends or acquaintances, 
maximal brain activity was observed in 
the caudate putamen and VTA (Figure 
D). Moreover, since "love is blind," 
it was reasoned that the regions of 
the brain essential for social vigilance 
and caution including several cortical 
regions and the amygdala should be 
diminished in their activations, which 
was also the case (Figure E). These 
observations placed love somewhat 
outside of the brain systems that medi- 
ate emotion—particularly limbic regions 
(see Chapter 29). Instead, brain regions 
essential for reward, risk taking, and 
social cognition seem to be featured. 
Subsequent studies suggest that the 
ups and downs of love recruit addi- 
tional brain circuits. Individuals recently 
rejected by a love interest retain 
maximal activation in the VTA and 
caudate nucleus in response to view- 
ing an image of the lost love, but add

a number of regions, including cortical 
regions also associated with motivation, 
calculation of gain and loss (such as 
in gambling or risk taking), emotional 
regulation, and even drug craving that 
are not activated in the "in love" state. 
Conversely, when men and women 
who have been married for significant 
lengths of time (average of more than 
20 years) are presented with images of 
their spouse versus other familiar indi- 
viduals, regions associated with attach- 
ment—particularly those activated by 
mother-child bonding—are differen- 
tially activated. 
While one is unlikely to see 
Valentine cards reading "You've carried 
away my VTA" 
any time soon, these 
results drain neither the passion nor 
mystery from love. Indeed, while we

versus that of a friend or acquaintance is detected in the ventral tegmental area 
of attraction and romance, the reasons 
why the beloved elicits these responses 
in the first place remain unknown. 
Nevertheless, these observations point 
to our subjective experience of romantic 
love as a key aspect of the overall biol- 
ogy of sex, reproduction, and parenting. 
The human experience of romantic love 
activates regions of the brain that favor 
reinforcement of a connection with a 
sexual partner, promote exclusivity in 
mating, and enhance cooperation in the 
rearing of offspring. These desires— 
passion, constancy, and domestic- 
ity—offer depth of feeling, whether 
expressed by poets or glimpsed in the 
fMRI. Thus, love may be like a drug in 
the best sense, in that it can be highly 
therapeutic and may benefit those who 
find it.

Hormonal Influences on 
Sexual Dimorphism 
The differentiation of male versus female gonadal tissue 
specified by chromosomal sex sets in motion a series of 
events that define major phenotypic dimorphisms both 
in the periphery and in the brain. The steroid hormones 
testosterone and estrogen (Figure 30.3A), secreted by the 
testes and ovaries, respectively, influence most aspects of 
sexual dimorphism. Accordingly, the initial differentia- 
tion of male and female gonads is the central event for the 
translation of chromosomal sex into phenotypic sex. Al- 
though both the ovaries (XX) and testes (XY, dependent 
on a functional SRY gene) secrete both estrogens and an- 
drogens, the two gonadal tissue types secrete very different 
levels of these hormones at distinct developmental times.

At critical junctures, differing hormone levels influence the 
undifferentiated primordial gonadal structures, resulting in 
divergent developmental paths of the genitalia and, later, 
in the secondary sex characteristics of males and females. 
This early hormonal influence on the development of sexu- 
ally dimorphic structures is sometimes referred to as the 
organizational effects of the gonadal steroids, reflecting their 
actions in guiding distinct male versus female differentia- 
tion in a variety of tissues, including the brain. 
Genotypic males experience an early surge of testoster- 
one, which, along with the peptide hormone Miillerian-in- 
hibiting substance (MIS), masculinizes the genitalia (Figure 
30.3B). This early testosterone surge may help masculinize 
the nervous system as well, and ultimately may affect be- 
havior; however, many of the specific effects of testosterone 
(and of estrogen) on the brain happen at somewhat later 
stages of development, in response to differential levels

FIGURE 30.3 
Gonadal sex steroids and 
their influence. (A) All sex steroids are syn- 
thesized from cholesterol, which is converted 
to progesterone, the common precursor, by 
four enzymatic reactions (represented by 
four arrows). Progesterone can then be con- 
verted into testosterone via another series 
of enzymatic reactions; testosterone in turn 
is converted to 5-a-dihydrotestosterone via 
5-a-reductase, or to 17-(-estradiol via an 
aromatase. 17-B-estradiol mediates most of 
the known hormonal effects in the brains of 
both female and male rodents. (B) In human 
male fetuses, masculinization of the genitalia 
reflects increased secretion of testosterone 
by the immature testes between the seventh 
and twentieth weeks of gestation. (B after 
Gustafson and Donahoe, 1994.)

of the hormones as well differing sensitivities of their tar- 
get tissues in the maturing fetal and neonatal brain and 
periphery. 
Paradoxically, many of the effects of testosterone in the 
male brain are in fact due to estrogens during midgesta- 
tion (the second trimester of pregnancy in humans) and 
result from the conversion of testosterone to estrogen in the 
brain. Vertebrate neurons contain an enzyme called aro- 
matase that converts testosterone to estradiol, a form of 
estrogen (see Figure 30.3A). Thus, the surge of testosterone 
in developing males also generates a surge of estradiol that 
affects developing neurons with appropriate receptors. In 
these instances, estrogen is assumed to mediate subsequent 
sexual dimorphisms that arise due to increased testoster- 
one. There are, however, instances where testosterone acts 
directly (i.e., through its own receptors) on developing as 
well as mature neurons. The direct activity of testosterone 
on its receptors may explain why female humans as well 
as rats and mice lacking aromatase are masculinized: the 
lack of conversion to estrogen results in a net increase in 
testosterone acting on testosterone-sensitive cells (i.e., cells 
expressing testosterone receptors). 
Estrogen, testosterone, and other steroids are highly li- 
pophilic molecules and are usually transported via carrier 
proteins circulating in the blood. Thus, the fetuses of pla- 
cental mammals are exposed to estrogens generated by the 
maternal ovary and placenta. So why doesn't this maternal 
estrogen interfere with sex differentiation in the offspring? 
Developing fetuses have high levels of a-fetoprotein, a 
protein that binds circulating estrogens, In both sexes, 
the brains is apparently protected from early exposure be- 
cause estrogens are bound by a-fetoprotein. Testosterone 
is not affected by a-fetoprotein, however, and is aroma- 
tized to estradiol only once inside neurons; therefore the 
male brain is exposed to an early dose of masculinizing

from the testosterone surge generated by 
the embryonic testes (see Figure 30.3B). 
The consequences of this difference in ste- 
roid metabolism for dimorphic brain de- 
velopment can be seen in mice in which 
the a-fetoprotein gene has been knocked 
out. Female mice that lack a-fetoprotein 
are infertile due to a failure of the hypo- 
thalamic control of ovulation, presumably 
(see below). Surprisingly, there is no in- 
formation available on ovulation or fertility 
for the rare cases of human females that 
lack the gene for a-fetoprotein. Male mice 
and men lacking this gene are healthy and fully fertile. 
Gonadal steroids act by binding to specific receptors 
for either testosterone or estrogen (Figure 30.4A). These 
receptors are distributed in fairly limited populations of 
cells in the mammalian brain, being concentrated at sites 
where reproductive and parenting functions are centrally 
represented and sexual dimorphisms are seen (Figure 
30.4B). Gonadal steroid receptors belong to a larger family 
of proteins called the steroid-thyroid nuclear receptors, 
which includes the receptors for vitamin A (retinoic acid; 
see Chapter 22), vitamin D, and glucorticoids. Unlike most 
receptors for peptide hormones (or neurotransmitters), 
which are on the cell surface, steroid—thyroid receptors are 
found in the cytoplasm. Thus, their ligands (testosterone 
and estrogen) must diffuse through the membrane to reach 
their receptors. When the active forms of testosterone (as 
5-a-dihydrotestosterone) or estrogen (as 17 -estradiol) 
bind to their respective receptors, the receptors move from

Primary Sexual Dimorphisms 
in the Brain 
Testosterone and estrogen each have specific targets, both 
in the periphery and in the brain. Many of these central 
targets are neural structures (particularly in the hypothala- 
mus) that control the external genitalia, gonads, and other 
dimorphic structures (such as mammary glands) and medi- 
ate sex-specific functions. A well studied example of central 
dimorphism related to motor control of a sex-specific repro- 
ductive behavior is the difference in size of the spinal nu- 
cleus of the bulbocavernosus (SNB) in the lumbar seg- 
ment of the rodent spinal cord, which innervates muscles of 
the genitalia. The motor neurons of the SNB innervate two

striated muscles of the male perineum (the bulbocaverno- 
sus and levator ani) that attach at the base of the penis and 
are involved in both penile erection and urination (Figure 
30.5A). In female rats, the bulbocavernosus muscle is ab- 
sent and the levator ani is dramatically reduced in size. The 
SNB, though present in both sexes, is significantly larger 
in males and contains more and larger neurons. Thus, the 
spinal cords of male and female rodents are sexually dimor- 
i a et 
el 
phic, in parallel with the genitalia. 

678 
CHAPTER 30 
The SNB dimorphism in rodents is established via the 
influence of testosterone around the time of birth; however, 
in this case the primary target of gonadal steroid hormone 
action is not in the brain, but in the perineal muscles that 
control the genitalia. At birth, undeveloped bulbocaverno- 
sus muscles of similar size are present in males and females 
(Figure 30.5B) and there are equivalent numbers of neu- 
rons in the SNB. The muscles in both males and females 
have testosterone receptors (as do all muscles, much to the 
chagrin of the governing bodies of major sports organiza- 
tions), but only males have sufficient endogenous levels of 
testosterone to activate these receptors. The activation of 
testosterone receptors in the male perineal muscles spares 
these muscles from the apoptotic cell death for which the 
female bulbocavernosus muscle is destined shortly after 
birth. Subsequently, the male peripheral target supports, 
via trophic interactions (see Chapter 24), the survival and 
differentiation of significantly more SNB neurons. In con- 
trast, the loss of a major target muscle in the female leads 
to trophic factor deprivation, cell atrophy, and apoptosis. If 
a female is artificially exposed to testosterone, the muscles 
are rescued and the number of SNB neurons approaches 
that of the male. This striking sexual dimorphism represents 
a special case of a more general rule: during development, 
structures in the central nervous system are matched to the 
periphery based on the level of trophic support provided 
by their targets. In addition to this trophic mechanism, 
SNB neurons in the male spinal cord express testosterone 
receptors, and activation of these receptors is thought to 
secondarily regulate the enhanced growth of SNB neurons. 
The functional significance of this hormonally induced di- 
morphism in neuronal size is unknown. 
As with most sexual dimorphisms, the situation in humans 
is considerably less clear than its analog in experimental ani- 
mals. The human spinal cord structure that corresponds to 
the rodent SNB is Onuf's nucleus, which consists of two cell 
groups in the sacral spinal cord (the dorsal medial and ven- 
tral lateral groups). The dorsal medial group is not sexually 
dimorphic; however, human females have fewer neurons in 
the ventral lateral group than males (Figure 30.5C). In con- 
trast to rodents, adult human females retain a bulbocaver- 
nosus muscle (which serves to constrict the vagina), but the 
muscle is smaller than in males. The difference in nuclear size 
and cell number in humans, as in rats, presumably reflects 
the difference in the number of bulbous cavernosus muscle 
fibers that Onuf's nucleus motor neurons innervate. 
Brain Dimorphisms and the Control 
of Reproductive Behaviors 
In addition to the primary motor neurons that directly in- 
nervate dimorphic genital muscles, there are dimorphic 
structures in the CNS that do not project directly to the 
genitalia. Nevertheless, their divergent cellular composition 
and size reflect differences in reproductive function. A major 
site of these dimorphisms is the hypothalamus, presumably 
because of its central role in the control of visceral motor 
function (see Chapter 21)—which includes the secretory, 
vascular, and smooth muscle control necessary for sexual 
function in both males and females. The concentration of 
gonadal steroid receptors in the hypothalamus (see Figure 
30.4B) reinforces this conclusion. Neurons in the antero- 
ventral and medial preoptic areas of the anterior hypothala- 
mus (where estrogen and androgen receptors are concen- 
trated) mediate key sexual and reproductive behaviors, and 
in most mammals there are sexually dimorphic differences 
in size and cell number of subsets of nuclei in this region. 
Among the fundamental differences between male and 
female mammals, the cycle for ovulation is perhaps the 
most distinctive: female gametes (eggs) mature at distinct 
times, whereas male gametes (sperm) are constantly gen- 
erated. A specific group of cells in the hypothalamus, the 
anteroventral paraventricular nucleus (AVPV), regu- 
lates the ovulatory cycle. AVPV cells are far more numer- 
ous in females than males and they project to other cell 
groups in the hypothalamus (Figure 30.6A). These pro- 
jections modulate the systemic release of gonadotropin- 
releasing hormone as well as prolactin secretion, both of 
which are key for the cyclic control of ovulation. Sexual 
dimorphism in the AVPV arises during development under 
the negative influence of elevated levels of testosterone in 
males. Transient elevated levels of testosterone (converted 
to estrogen by aromatase in the hypothalamus) induce 
cell death in the developing male AVPV; the absence of 
testosterone in females insures AVPV cell survival. As is 
the case for many other sexually dimorphic cell groups, 
altering hormone levels during development can alter the 
AVPV dimorphism. Thus, elevated testosterone at the criti- 
cal stage of development in the female will cause AVPV cell 
death and lack of ovulation, and lack of testosterone sig- 
naling in males (via aromatized 17-B-estradiol binding to 
estrogen receptors) will rescue the AVPV cells that would 
normally die (Figure 30.6A). 
In rodents, another nuclear group in the hypothalamus, 
the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area 
(SDN-POA), is consistently larger and has more neurons 
in males than in females (Figure 30.6B). The size and cell 
number of this nucleus are regulated by testosterone. In the 
male, estradiol (once again derived from testosterone via 
aromatase) influences anti-apoptotic genes and stabilizes 
SDN-POA neurons. In the female, the lack of significant 
levels of circulating testosterone leads to cell death. Females 
exposed to elevated levels of androgens during early post- 
natal life develop an enlarged SDN-POA with more neu- 
rons, presumably due to diminished cell death. In contrast 
to the spinal cord, however, the effects of testosterone on 
cell survival in the SDN-POA are direct, via the conversion 
to estrogen in the brain and (presumably) the subsequent

actions of estrogen via its receptors on SND-POA neurons. 
This dimorphism, like most others, can ultimately be linked 
to the differing ability of male and female gonadal tissues to 
provide distinct levels of testosterone and estrogen. Similar 
dimorphisms have been reported for a number of other nu- 
clei in the preoptic area of the human hypothalamus; how- 
ever, their consistency and relationship to sexual behavior 
remains controversial (see below). 
In a range of laboratory animals, the preoptic area in 
general, including the SDN-POA, has been implicated in

nergic neurons (labeled here with an antibody 
against the dopamine-synthetic enzyme tyro- 
sine hydroxylase) that is larger in females than 
in males and is responsible for the control of 
cyclic ovulation. When the estrogen receptor 
gene is inactivated in males (thus preventing 
the masculinizing effects of testosterone, con- 
verted in the brain to estrodiol by aromatase), 
the AVPV is similar in size to that of the female

dimorphic sexual behaviors. In male rats, 
lesions of the entire preoptic area abolish 
all copulatory behavior, while more dis- 
crete lesions of the SDN-POA diminish the 
frequency of mounting and copulation. In 
female rats, such lesions yield individuals 
that avoid male partners and do not dis- 
play female-specific copulatory behaviors. 
Thus, the preoptic area is thought to me- 
diate mate selection and the preparatory 
behaviors for copulation, as well as some 
of the motor and visceral aspects of male 
intromission and ejaculation, as well as female copulatory 
responses. Physiological recordings from neurons of the 
medial preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus in both 
rats and monkeys support this view. These neurons fire dur- 
ing different phases of sexual arousal and partner-seeking 
in females and males. Such recordings have been carried 
out in unrestrained rats with electrode arrays implanted in 
their brains, and in male monkeys in a flexible restraining 
apparatus that allows access to a receptive female by press- 
ing a bar that brings the female close enough for the male to

mount her. In the female, preoptic area neurons fire rapidly 
during specific phases of copulation; many of these neurons 
are maximally active during intromission (penile insertion 
into the vagina) as well as during the preparatory phases 
of mounting and the consummatory phase of ejaculation 
by the male (Figure 30.6C). Neurons in the medial preoptic 
area of the male hypothalamus fire rapidly before sexual 
behavior, but decrease their activity upon contact with the 
female, mating, and ejaculation (Figure 30.6C,D). Neurons 
in the dorsal anterior hypothalamus of both sexes, particu- 
larly the paraventricular nucleus, are maximally active dur- 
ing intercourse. Thus the neural structures and circuits that 
subserve male- and female-specific reproductive behaviors 
are both structurally and functionally dimorphic. 
Structural and Functional 
Dimorphisms for Pregnancy 
and Parenting 
Perhaps most obvious sexual dimorphism in mammals is 
gestation (pregnancy), which is the unique biological role 
of the female. Pregnancy in females, however, differs from 
other dimorphisms because it is a transient state. Thus, 
the brain is altered—temporarily—in parallel with obvious 
physical as well as behavioral changes. Most fe- 
male mammals gain weight while pregnant—the 
common wisdom holds that the mother is "eating 
for two." This change in appetite is not a simple 
choice to eat more, but relies on a suppression of 
leptin signaling (which normally provides feed- 
back from the periphery to indicate satiety; see 
Box 21C) in the arcuate and ventromedial nuclei 
FIGURE 30.7 
Leptin-mediated feedback for 
appetite suppression is altered in pregnant 
females. (A) There is a high concentration of leptin 
receptors in the ventromedial nuclei of the hypo- 
thalamus (VM), and in the arcuate nucleus (AN) in 
the rat anterior hypothalamus. These receptors, upon

binding leptin (released systemically after satiety

is reached) stimulate phosphorylation of the STAT 
kinase (pSTAT). (B) Neurons in the VMH expressing 
pSTAT (recognized by an antibody against the phos- 
phorylated STAT kinase) in response to an injection 
of leptin are more numerous in non-pregnant than 
in pregnant females. (C) Quantification of the fre- 
quency of pSTAT-expressing cells in the VMH shows 
a threefold decrease in leptin-activated pSTAT cells 
in pregnant females. This suggests that in response 
to pregnancy, sensitivity to leptin-mediated satiety 
is suppressed, leading to increased appetite and 
food intake. (A after Ladyman et al., 2010; B,C from 
Ladyman and Grattan, 2005.)

of the hypothalamus. These nuclei are of similar size and 
cell number in males and females, and in both sexes, the 
neurons in these nuclei normally express leptin receptors. 
Upon binding circulating leptin, whose levels are influenced 
by feeding, these neurons activate STAT kinases that alter 
neuronal activity and suppress appetite. In pregnant females, 
expression of leptin receptors is diminished and STAT sig- 
naling declines in the relevant hypothalamic neurons, thus 
preventing normal feedback-mediated appetite suppression 
and facilitating greater food intake to accommodate gesta- 
tional needs (Figure 30.7). 
Another obvious transient dimorphism is lactation, 
which reflects the anatomic and cellular specialization of 
mammary glands in the periphery of female mammals to 
produce the milk that nourishes newborn offspring. The 
control of lactation, its responsiveness to the hormonal 
state of a nursing mother, and its relationship to other pa- 
rental behaviors including nesting, offspring recognition, 
and grooming provide examples of the activational effects 
(as opposed to organizational effects) of gonadal steroids 
on the brain and on sexually dimorphic behaviors. Cells 
sensitive to estrogen, testosterone, and related hormones 
transiently change their functional properties in response 
to fluctuations in steroid hormone levels, often activating 
a sexually dimorphic physiological response or behavior.

As seen above for feeding centers during 
pregnancy, such changes are seen in brain 
regions that do not have dramatic struc- 
tural dimorphisms. 
In mammals, two hypothalamic nuclei, 
the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and 
the supraoptic nucleus (SON), are spe- 
cialized for the control of lactation (Figure 
30.8A). These nuclei also influence general 
control of blood pressure and water bal- 
ance via their control of vasopressin and 
oxytocin secretion (see Chapter 21). Al-

behaviors are also influenced by olfactory cues. The circuit 
changes that facilitate lactation can be induced in virgin fe- 
males simply by placing them in the vicinity of pups, where 
the females recognize distinct pheromonal signals. 
Beyond endocrine and hypothalamic control of nurs- 
ing, other areas of the central nervous system are engaged, 
including the somatic sensory representation of the body 
surface in the cerebral cortex. In nursing females, this

representation dynamically accommodates the increased

male rats, the cortical representation of the ventrum (the 
chest region that includes mammary tissue and nipples) en- 
larges transiently in the somatic sensory cortex, becoming 
approximately twice as large as in non-lactating controls. 
Moreover, the receptive field sizes of neurons representing 
the skin of the ventrum in lactating females are decreased 
to about one-third of that of non-lactating females 
(Figure 30.9), suggesting increased sensitivity and 
resolution of the somatic sensory stimulation pro- 
vided by nursing pups. Both the increase in cortical 
representation and the decrease in receptive field 
size highlight the fact that changes in behavior 
requiring increased sensitivity and more vigorous 
responses can be reflected in changes of cortical 
circuitry in adult animals (Box 30B). The extent to 
which these changes are under hormonal control 
versus more standard mechanisms of experience- 
dependent plasticity (see Chapters 8 and 24) re- 
mains to be determined.

BOX 30B The Good Mother 
_ In Hollywood movies, fairy tales, and 
_ myths, mothers have been portrayed 
__as both saintly (who can forget Stella 
Dallas?) and evil (remember Medea?). 
While these stories rarely address the 
_ source of maternal warmth and feeling 
- 
(or lack thereof), recent observations 
_ suggest strongly that good mothers are 
made, not born. 
The mothers in question are female 
_ 
rats, whose repertoire of motherly 
behaviors does not extend to either 
sacrificing her life for her children (as 
did Stella Dallas) or to sacrificing her 
children (Medea). Instead, the sign of 
a good rat mother is the amount of 
time she spends licking and grooming 
her pups when she enters the nest for 
nursing, and her posture during nurs- 
ing itself. The good rat mother arches 
her back distinctively (see figure), 
presumably allowing for better access 
for the pups without extreme spatial 
confinement. "Bad" rat mothers lick 
and groom much less frequently and 
do not arch their backs when nurs- 
ing. Offspring reared by high licking- 
| grooming/arched back nursing ("LG/ 
ABN") mothers grow up to have much 
greater adaptive response to stress and 
more modulated responses to fearful 
stimuli. When pups from low LG/ABN 
mice are transferred to high LG/ABN 
mothers, they acquire stress responses 
consistent with the maternal qualities of 
their new mother. Thus, "good" moth- 
ering, perhaps as much or even more 
than genetic predisposition (at least in 
The inset photo shows a "good" rat mother 
licking and grooming her pups; her back 
is arched to accommodate nursing. In the 
model diagrammed here, increased serotonin 
levels elicited by the increased tactile stimula- 
tion provided by a high LG/ABN mother may 
lead to a signaling cascade that ultimately 
alters expression of the glucocorticoid recep- 
tor (GR) gene. In this model, adequate nursing 
eliminates methyl groups from the DNA in 
a brain-specific promoter region of GR, thus 
upregulating the GR gene in the brains of 
_ 
these pups. (After Meaney and Szyf, 2005.) 
rats), makes for much better adjusted 
offspring and insures good mothering 
for the next generation. 
Good maternal behavior apparently 
is essential for the health and well-being 
of offspring. Thus, the acquisition of 
motherly skills becomes key in under- 
standing the transmission of adaptive 
stress responses from generation to 
generation. Michael Meaney and his 
colleagues at McGill University asked 
whether good mother rats—high LG/ 
ABN females—were determined geneti- 
cally or acquired their maternal behav- 
iors based on their early experiences. By 
cross-fostering offspring of established 
low LG/ABN mothers with high LG/ 
ABN mothers and vice versa, they dem- 
onstrated that, regardless of genetic 
identity, maternal skills depended on 
the skills of the mother that reared the 
pups. High LG/ABN mothers had foster 
daughters who were also high LG/ABN 
mothers—even if their birth mothers

were low LG/ABN. Similarly, female 
offspring of high LG/ABN mothers 
displayed low LG/ABN maternal skills 
when reared by a low LG/ABN foster 
mother. These observations suggest 
strongly that good mothers are made, 
not born, and that the foundation for 
maternal skills is established early in 
life—in part by the maternal behaviors 
to which female pups are exposed. 
Subsequent work from Meaney's 
laboratory as well as others has shown 
that one of the key biological targets of 
the effects of early maternal behavior 
on offspring is the expression of gluco- 
corticoid receptors in the hippocampus. 
These steroid—thyroid family recep- 
tors (see Figure 30.4) are key regula- 
tors of the stress response throughout 
the organism. Offspring of high LG/ 
ABN mothers have high levels of glu- 
corcorticoid receptor expression in the 
hippocampus, and thus are presum- 
ably are better equipped to deal with

the deleterious effects of stress. But the 
_ maternal behaviors that establish these 
_ differences are apparently not strictly 
_ encoded by the genome (they are not 
heritable, and can be acquired based 
_ upon experience), so how are differing 
_ levels of gene expression established 
_ in the offspring of high versus low LG/ 
ABN mothers? 
The tentative answer is that high 
LG/ABN behavior elicits altered levels 
of serotonergic signaling in the off- 
_ spring. This signaling, via a specific 
_ serotonin receptor and subsequent 
_ signaling cascade, establishes differ- 
_ ential expression of the glucocorticoid 
_ receptor via genomic imprinting—local 
_ modification of DNA and chromatin 
_ that leads to long-lasting changes in 
_ gene expression. The details of this 
intriguing epigenetic mechanism for 
_ establishing essential differences in 
behavior remain to be determined. It 
appears that the glucocorticoid recep- 
tor gene has several regulatory regions 
that enable transcription of this gene in 
different cell types. The signals initiated 
by maternal care alter the DNA meth- 
ylation pattern and chromatin structure 
of a regulatory region that binds brain- 
specific transcription factors, including 
one called NGF1-A. Those rat pups 
that do not get adequate licking and 
grooming have methylated DNA in that 
region of the GR gene that would nor- 
mally bind NGF1-A, which cannot bind 
to the methylated DNA and therefore 
_ does not activate transcription of the 
GR gene in the brain. As a result, the 
glucocorticoid receptor protein is not 
present to negatively regulate the stress 
response. 
Whatever the details of the molecu- 
lar mechanism may be, early experi- 
ence can profoundly and irreversibly 
alter an entire lifetime of essential 
behaviors. Unfortunately, these stud- 
ies also suggest that the happy end- 
ings enjoyed by certain fictional off- 
spring who were fostered by wicked 
stepmothers—characters like Snow 
White, Cinderella, and Hansel and 
Gretl—may need to be rewritten to 
project a far more grim ever-after than 
previously imagined.

Cellular and Molecular Basis 
of Sexually Dimorphic Structures 
and Behaviors 
The establishment, maintenance, and plasticity of sexually 
dimorphic structures and behaviors clearly depend on dif- 
ferences in organizational as well as activational effects of 
circulating levels of gonadal steroids. Thus, an important 
goal is to understand how gonadal steroids, their receptors 
and synthetic enzymes, and related genes influence neuro- 
nal structure and function. 
One essential target for estrogen and testosterone must 
be the molecular pathways that regulate cell survival and 
cell death, since many sexually dimorphic nuclei achieve 
their distinct cell numbers and cell sizes through apoptotic 
cell death and trophically mediated stabilization and growth 
of the surviving cells. It is not clear how estrogen and tes- 
tosterone initially stimulate mechanisms that favor either 
apoptosis or cell survival; however, recent evidence implies 
that the ultimate targets of the sex steroids are genes that 
regulate apoptotic cell death. Male or female mice overex- 
pressing the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2 have more neurons in 
the SNB, while mice in which the pro-apoptotic gene Bax 
has been inactivated do not display the sexual dimorphisms 
normally seen in the basal forebrain. Thus, the regulation of 
structural sexual dimorphisms that match phenotypic sex 
is most likely dependent on gonadal steroid regulation of 
apoptosis, perhaps further modulated by trophic factors dur- 
ing brain development (see Figure 30.5). 
Besides influencing cell death, in certain instances go- 
nadal steroids can act as trophic factors, directly regulating 
neuronal size as well as process growth. During develop- 
ment, and to some extent throughout life, estradiol (the 
aromatized form of estrogen; see Figure 30.3A) stimulates 
brain dimorphisms by increasing cell size, nuclear volume, 
dendritic length, dendritic branching, dendritic spine den- 
sity, and synaptic connectivity of the sensitive neurons, in- 
dependent of cell survival or apoptosis (Figure 30.10A,B). 
Testosterone can also influence neuronal size and differen- 
tiation, at least in vitro, in neurons that express testosterone 
receptors (Figure 30.10C,D); however, the extent to which 
these effects rely on the direct action of testosterone on its 
receptor versus aromatized 176-estradiol via estrogen re- 
ceptors is unclear. 
Estradiol can also stimulate an increase in the number 
of synaptic contacts in adult animals. For example, during 
periods of high circulating estrogen in the estrous cycle of 
female rodents (or after administration of exogenous es- 
trogen), there is an increase in the density of spines (and 
presumably synapses) on the apical dendrites of pyramidal 
neurons in the hippocampus (see Figure 30.10B). These

C from Meusberger and Keast, 2001.) 
Dendritic spines 
engendered by estrous-dependent hippocampal changes 
is not understood. 
Gonadal steroids can also modify electrical signaling 
between neurons in a variety of brain regions. Perhaps 
the most compelling example of this phenomenon is in 
the periventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, 
where fluctuating steroid levels facilitate the formation of 
gap junctions by regulating the transcription of relevant 
proteins. The resulting increase in gap junctions allows for 
neuronal synchrony correlated with lactation (see Figure 
30.8). In addition, the influences of gonadal steroids, par- 
ticularly estrogen, on neuronal activity have been evalu- 
ated in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is an estab- 
lished site of neuronal plasticity (see Chapters 24 and 31) 
and is sensitive to hormonal fluctuations, including those 
seen during estrous. Estrogen receptors are expressed by 
mature neurons and often are localized to the cytoplasm 
at synapses, as well as in the cytoplasm of the cell body 
(Figure 30.11A). Estrogen can modify excitable properties 
of hippocampal neurons, including K* and Ca* conduc- 
tances and the rate of action potential firing. Estrogen can

also influence hippocampal synaptic signaling and plastic- 
ity. Estrogen at relatively high concentrations (arguably 
higher than those seen physiologically) can increase the 
amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents over minutes 
to hours and, when coupled with high-frequency stimula- 
tion that elicits long-term potentiation (LTP; see Chapter 
24) results in a sustained change in excitatory postsynaptic 
potentials (Figure 30.11B,C). It is tempting to speculate that 
such changes underlie some of the learned behaviors and 
memories associated with fluctuating gonadal steroid lev- 
els, and therefore are associated with distinct reproductive 
behaviors. There is no solid evidence as yet that supports 
this speculation. 
Steroid Receptors and Responses 
in the Adult Brain 
Estrogens and androgens can influence neuronal and glial 
structure and function throughout life in brain regions 
beyond the hypothalamus, and in circumstances beyond 
those directly associated with reproduction and parent- 
ing. The evidence of this influence in humans includes the 
consequences for behavior of therapeutic removal of the 
gonads (e.g., hysterectomy for medical reasons in women, 
or orchiotomy—removal of the testis—to treat testicular

as a change in the slope of the EPSP, which 
reflects excitatory threshold) following high- 
frequency stimulation. (After Woolley, 2007.) 
cancer in men), followed by hormone re- 
placement therapy. Perhaps best known 
among these apparent influences are the 
suggested "neuroprotective" effects of 
- 
estrogens for ischemic and other degen- 
erative changes in neurons, including those associated with 
age- or stress-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's 
disease. The significance of these effects remains highly 
controversial due to difficulties in evaluating the large, het- 
erogenous population of women who have received estro- 
gen replacement therapy. 
The consequences of testosterone treatment following 
orchiotomy, or the effects of illicit testosterone use on mood 
and behavior (especially aggressive behavior) in athletes in- 
dicates that the brain remains sensitive to this particular 
androgen throughout life. It is not certain whether these 
phenomena represent direct actions of testosterone (or of 
estradiol following aromatization in the brain). The fairly 
widespread distribution of estrogen and androgen receptors 
in the adult brain most likely mediates ongoing activational 
effects on a wide range of behaviors beyond those directly 
related to reproduction and parenting (Figure 30.12). Aside 
from their high concentrations in the hypothalamus (see 
Figure 30.4B), there are significant numbers of both estro- 
gen and androgen receptors in the cerebral cortex, amyg- 
dala, and substantia nigra. These observations inform a 
number of important clinical issues, in particular the po- 
tential side effects of therapies that manipulate gonadal ste- 
roid signaling, including estrogen and androgen receptor 
antagonists for the treatment of breast and prostate cancer.

the hypothalamic nuclei that control gonadal function, sexual behavior, and parent- 
ing behavior; they also include large regions of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hip- 
pocampus, thalamus, substantia nigra, and cerebellum. The significance of gonadal 
steroid receptor expression and activity at sites beyond the hypothalamus is less well 
understood than their reproduction-specific functions. They may provide a substrate 
for the influence of these hormones on behaviors beyond reproduction and parent- 
ing, including cognition (cortex), learning and memory (cortex, hippocampus, amyg- 
dala), aggression and stress (hippocampus, amygdala), pain sensation (thalamus, 
brainstem), and motor control (substantia nigra, cerebellum).

variation, called intersexuality, is apparent in 1-2% of all

presence of SRY on the Y chromosome; see Figure 30.2), but 
some female secondary sex characteristics (e.g., mammary 
tissue), presumably due to a "double dose" of the genes on 
the X chromosome. This increased dosage may reflect dis- 
ruption of the normal process of X-inactivation due to the 
presence of a Y chromosome. (In XX females, one of each 
copy of most X chromosome genes is inactivated via DNA 
modifications that insure appropriate expression levels). XO 
individuals (Turner's syndrome) are small in stature, have

external genitalia (which usually appear female), and are 
sterile. XYY individuals are the least compromised. Their 
gonadal tissues and external genitalia are male (although 
they are sterile); their primary identifying physical char- 
acteristic is slightly increased height. 
Other genetic disorders that result in intersexuality are 
the result of mutations in genes that encode metabolic en- 
zymes for steroid hormone production. One of the most 
prevalent examples is congenital adrenal hyperplasia 
(CAH), usually the result of mutations in the gene encod- 
ing 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme that, using testosterone as 
the precursor, synthesizes cortisol and aldosterone in the 
adrenal gland. In affected individuals, failure of cortisol 
and aldosterone synthesis leads to increased testosterone, 
and XY genotypes with CAH are dramatically masculin- 
ized, often very tall at an early age, and undergo precocious 
puberty. In XX genotypes, CAH leads to overactive adrenal 
secretion of testosterone during development, resulting in 
an ambiguous, masculinized sexual phenotype. 
Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) (sometimes 
called "testicular feminization") illustrates the results of ge- 
netic disruption of receptor-mediated responses to gonadal 
steroids. The best studied cases of AIS are males who carry 
mutations in the gene encoding the receptors for testos- 
terone and/or Miillerian-inhibiting hormone (see Figure 
30.2B). In these XY individuals, testes form and secrete an- 
drogens; however the testes are hypotrophic, and the de- 
ficiency of androgen receptors leads to the development of 
female external genitalia. Thus, XY AIS individuals look like 
females and self-identify as female, even though they have 
a Y chromosome and testicular tissues. Androgen-insen- 
sitive individuals present one of the strongest arguments 
that brain circuits in primates are masculinized mainly by 
the action of androgens rather than by estrogens, which are 
the masculinizing agent in rodents. 
In XY infants deficient in one of two forms of 5-a-re- 
ductase, which catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to 
the biologically active dihydrotestosterone during fetal and 
early postnatal life, the genitalia resemble those of females. 
These individuals are generally perceived and raised as 
females. At puberty, however, testicular secretion of tes- 
tosterone increases and dihydrotestosterone synthesis is 
regulated by the second 5-a-reductase variant (encoded 
by a separate gene). At this point the apparent clitoris 
enlarges into a penis and the testes descend. In the Do- 
minican Republic, where this recessive syndrome has been 
thoroughly studied in particularly consanguinous families, 
the condition is referred to colloquially as "guevedoces," 
roughly translated "testes-at-twelve." Genetic testing can 
identify affected children, most of who are then raised from 
birth in a manner consistent with their genotypic sex. An- 
ecdotal reports indicate that most such young men retain 
their masculine gender identity as well as a heterosexual 
sexual orientation. 
Due to the long-range psychological and social con- 
sequences of conflict between genotypic sex, phenotypic 
sex, and sexual and gender identity, the rapid diagnosis of 
intersexuality and a variety of adjustments to assure ap- 
propriate matching of the sex of an individual's body, brain, 
and gender identity as soon as possible after birth are now 
standard clinical practice. 
Sexual Orientation and the Brain: 
Molecular and Genetic Analysis 
Much of the biology of sex and the brain focuses on the re- 
lationship between genotypic sex and phenotypic sex. This 
implies that the behavioral dimensions of a person's sex is 
defined ultimately by their gonadal tissues, the pattern of 
hormonal exposure these tissues provide for the brain, and 
the subsequent development of the brain to manage neu- 
ral control of sexual function. Such assumptions, however, 
do not provide a compelling cellular or molecular basis for 
understanding a far more subtle aspect of sexual behav- 
ior: individual sexual identity. Perhaps the most obvious 
example of sexual identity is sexual orientation. Although 
this most personal of topics has engendered very public de- 
bates, many of which invoke incomplete or relatively weak 
scientific evidence to support strongly held opinions, the 
biological basis upon which sexual identity—including sex- 
ual orientation—rests remains ill-defined. Current efforts 
to define the biology of sexual identity focus on two issues: 
the genetics and molecular biology of sexual orientation 
(or, more broadly defined, mate choice); and differences in 
brain structure and function between heterosexual and ho- 
mosexual individuals that might influence sexual attraction, 
arousal and behavior. Despite many uncertainties, this work 
has clearly placed human sexuality—both heterosexual and 
homosexual—on a much firmer biological foundation. This 
is a welcome advance over the not-too-distant past when 
sexual identity and behavior was commonly explained (or 
stigmatized) in social, psychoanalytical, or moralistic terms. 
Although the subtleties of attraction, attachment, and 
mate preference are most likely lacking in the fruit fly Dro- 
sophila, thorough genetic analysis is possible. Thus, the 
molecular and genetic control of sexual identity, behavior, 
and (narrowly defined) sexual orientation are perhaps best 
understood in this species. After extensive evaluation of the 
genetics of sex determination in Drosophila, it became clear 
that the gene cascade controlling phenotypic sex (Figure 
30.13A) was insufficient to explain the differentiation of 
neural circuits that mediate male- or female-specific sexual 
behavior. When mutated, genes responsible for phenotypic 
sex can transform female body structures into male body 
structures in genetic females and vice-versa, but they do 
not disrupt male- and female-specific courtship—the key 
behaviors that define sexual identity in flies. A single gene, 
fruitless, helps explain this discrepancy between genetic

transcript has been expressed in the brain via experimental 
insertion of the appropriate male-specific promoter. (B from

CHAPTER 30 
control of gonadal differentiation and secondary sex charac- 
teristics versus sex-specific reproductive behavior mediated 
by the fly's nervous system. 
Fruitless, a transcription factor that regulates multiple 
downstream target genes, apparently exerts a major effect 
on organizing neural circuitry in the Drosophila brain that 
mediates male-specific behaviors. A male-specific form of 
fruitless is expressed in subsets of neurons in the fly periph- 
eral and central nervous system; it is not seen in gonadal tis- 
sue or other sexually dimorphic peripheral structures. Both 
males and females have the fruitless gene; however, due to 
alternative splicing (Figure 30.13B), a male-specific tran- 
script and the functional "male-only" fruitless transcription 
factor protein it encodes are found only in the male brain. 
In contrast, the female-specific splice variant does not en- 
code a functional protein. The male-specific splice variant 
of fruitless is preferentially expressed in a subset of neurons 
in the brains of male flies (see Figure 30.13A). The same 
neurons are present in the female brain; however, females 
lack functional fruitless protein. This observation suggests 
that fruitless regulates the details of neural circuit structure 
and function in the male brain, without imposing an abso- 
lute cellular or structural dimorphism (since the same cells 
are present in males and females). Furthermore, it provides 
evidence that the brain can be specialized—potentially for 
sex-related behaviors—via molecular mechanisms that are 
entirely independent of peripheral differences in gonads or 
secondary sex characteristics. 
This surprising conclusion would only be tenable if loss 
of functional fruitless protein in the brains of male flies 
caused detectable changes in male-specific behaviors. This 
is in fact the case: if the male-specific transcript is deleted, 
males fail to exhibit male-specific courtship. In contrast, 
when the gene is inactivated only in olfactory neurons of 
the fly brain, males fail to habituate to other males based on 
olfactory cues and attempt to court and mate them (Figure 
30.13C). Finally, when the male-specific form of fruitless is 
expressed in the female brain, it suppresses female-specific 
behaviors and results in male-specific courtship behavior 
by female flies (Figure 30.13D). These observations indi- 
cate that there is genetic control of circuits in the nervous 
system that mediate recognition and preference of opposite 
versus same sex, as well as behavioral responses that de- 
fine—narrowly, in the case of the fly—heterosexual versus 
homosexual mating behavior. 
Understanding the genetics and molecular biology of 
human sexual orientation—which clearly encompasses a 
much broader repertoire of behaviors—lacks the resolution 
afforded by the extensive genetic analyses possible in Dro- 
sophila. In humans, the best evidence for a genetic compo- 
nent underlying complex behaviors such as sexual orienta- 
tion comes from studies of monozygotic twins. Such studies 
indicate a slightly higher probability that both monozygotic 
twins will be homosexual than is the case for dizygotic 
twins or sibling pairs. While this outcome suggests a ge- 
netic dimension for sexual orientation, the concordance rate 
(30%; that is, in 30 out of every 100 pairs of monozygotic 
twins in which one twin is homosexual, the other twin will 
share that sexual orientation) is lower than for other com- 
plex traits or diseases (the concordance rate for schizophre- 
nia, for example, is approximately 50%). Although genetic 
studies have attempted to map chromosomal inheritance of 
male homosexuality, none has provided replicable, defini- 
tive linkages. There is, however, some indication that in- 
heritance of male homosexuality may be maternally biased, 
leading to speculation of an X-linked trait. 
Finally, a number of epidemiological observations sug- 
gest additional molecular explanations of the establishment 
of human sexual orientation. Foremost among these is the 
observation that male sibling birth order correlates strongly 
with homosexuality: for each subsequent male child born 
to a mother, the probability of homosexuality increases by 
approximately 30%. This observation suggests the intrigu- 
ing hypothesis that women are exposed to male-specific 
antigens each time they gestate a male child, possibly es- 
tablishing an increased "immunity" that somehow disrupts 
the ability of subsequent sons to respond to masculinizing 
signals during intrauterine development. While provoca- 
tive, this explanation, along with all others, remains specu- 
lative. At present, there are no genetic or molecular insights 
into the basis of sexual identity and behavior in humans 
that parallel those described in Drosophila. 
Sexual Orientation and Human 
Brain Structure 
In the early 1990s, several high-profile studies of post 
mortem brain samples reported anatomical dimorphisms 
between the brains of homosexual and heterosexual men. 
This issue was approached primarily in males, most likely 
because of the increased availability of post mortem brain 
samples from self-identified homosexual men who suffered 
AIDS-related deaths—a complicating factor for interpreta- 
tion of these studies. Such analyses of anatomical dimor- 
phisms are based on the notion that mechanisms resulting 
in a "homosexual brain" (if such a singular entity exists) 
would tend to make dimorphic structures more feminized 
in homosexual men and masculinized in homosexual 
women. 
Initial studies by Simon LeVay in a much-cited analysis 
of a sample of post mortem tissue from heterosexual and 
homosexual men indicated that such differences might ex- 
ist. These observations, however, were only modestly sig- 
nificant and not absolutely predictive. They suggested that 
INAH3, a sexually dimorphic subnucleus of the interstitial 
nuclei of the hypothalamus (INAH, the homolog of the 
sexually dimorphic SDN-POA in rodents; see Figure 30.6B) 
was smaller in homosexual than in heterosexual men, being 

(A) Androgen administered

similar in size to that of heterosexual women. Nevertheless, 
the size of INAH3 alone was not a reliable indicator of sexual 
orientation in the sample reported by LeVay. Subsequent 
studies that have taken into account a significant tendency 
for degenerative changes in brain tissue from HIV-positive 
patients, regardless of sexual orientation, failed to replicate 
this suggested dimorphism. Indeed, several other anatomi- 
cal dimorphisms of the hypothalamus in heterosexual and 
homosexual men (women remain largely unstudied) have 
failed to generate consistent results. Given the current evi- 
dence, it would seem that the volume and number of neu- 
rons in sexually dimorphic hypothalamic nuclei does not, 
taken alone, reliably predict sexual orientation. 
The application of functional imaging techniques to this 
question has added some clarity by mapping differences in 
activation of potentially functionally dimorphic regions in 
the brains of heterosexual and homosexual men and women 
in response to behaviorally relevant stimuli. In these stud- 
ies, subjects have been carefully selected for comparable 
age, consistent sexual orientation (both heterosexual and 
homosexual), relationship status (a balanced percentage 
of both the heterosexual and homosexual subjects were in 
committed relationships), age, and HIV status (none of the 
subjects were HIV-positive). Heterosexual men and women 
show differential patterns of hypothalamic activation when 
presented with estrogens and androgens as odorants (see 
Chapter 15). In homosexual men, androgens activate the 
anterior hypothalamus as they do in heterosexual women, 
and in homosexual women estrogens activate the anterior 
hypothalamus, as in heterosexual men (Figure 30.14). The 
behavioral significance of this functional dimorphism is not 
clear. Nevertheless, these observations provide the best evi- 
dence to date for the existence of differences in the brain 
correlated with sexual identity or orientation. Moreover,

these differences suggest that there may be some 
acquisition of female characteristics in the brains 
of homosexual men and male characteristics in the 
brains of homosexual women. As in fruit flies, these 
functional differences may reflect subtle distinctions 
in the activity or connections of subsets of neurons 
in brain regions the mediate sexual behaviors rather 
than gross dimorphisms related to more obvious dif- 
ferences in phenotypic sex. 
'Sex-Based Differences in 
Cognitive Functions 
Aside from conventional wisdom (or prejudice) that boys 
and girls and/or men and women have greater aptitudes 
for, or interest in, certain tasks, there is little scientific evi- 
dence that the cognitive abilities of men and women dif- 
fer in ways that correlate strictly with either genotypic or 
phenotypic sex. Many apparent sex differences in cognitive 
tasks such as language, learning, memory, or visuospatial 
ability reflect influences not directly related to genetically 
established sexual dimorphisms. Thus, statistically signifi- 
cant differences in the performance of men and women 
on a variety of tasks are at least as likely to represent so- 
cial or cultural influences that result in different patterns of 
learned behavior, and the relationship of these behaviors 
to genotypic or phenotypic sex is uncertain. It is basically 
impossible to say if such influences were applied equally 
to both sexes, equality in performance of the tasks would 
not be seen. 
The issue of brain structural differences beyond those in 
the spinal cord and hypothalamus has proven even more 
difficult to evaluate. Post mortem as well as structural MRI 
analyses suggest that several structures (including cerebral 
commissures like the corpus callosum and anterior com- 
missure, nuclei like the amygdala, and a number of cortical 
regions) may differ in size or shape in men and women 
(Figure 30.15). Many of the relevant anatomical studies, 
however, are complicated by small samples and highly de- 
rived analyses that reveal only small differences in size and 
shape, and often are not replicated in additional indepen- 
dent samples.

A great deal of interest has focused upon the amygdala 
as the most likely central site of sexual dimorphism beyond 
the spinal cord and hypothalamus, perhaps because of its 
established role in regulating the output of hypothalamic 
nuclei, as well as the hypersexuality observed in animals or 
patients with bilateral damage to the amygdala (see Chap- 
ter 29). Some MRI studies suggest that the male amygdala 
has a larger volume than the female; however, additional 
observations indicate that these differences are not signifi- 
cant when measurements are corrected for brain size or 
cranial volume that differ in men and women. Studies of 
intersex subjects (see Table 30.1) suggest that the amygdala 
may be sexually dimorphic, perhaps due to the influence 
of altered gonadal steroid levels in these conditions. These 
studies, however, are complicated by the generally smaller 
total brain size in genetically intersex individuals. 
In contrast to this somewhat equivocal anatomical data, 
there is a fairly robust functional distinction in the amyg- 
dalas of men and women performing emotional memory 
tasks. In such tasks, subjects view aversive or frightening 
films or images that elicit an emotional response. Several 
weeks later, the subjects are evaluated for their memory of 
these images. In recalling emotionally charged content, the 
right amygdala is maximally activated in men, while the 
left is maximally activated in women (Figure 30.16). These 
functional differences suggest that laterality of activation, 
rather than size of the nucleus, is the most robust sexual 
FIGURE 30.15 Summary of potentially dimorphic brain 
regions beyond the hypothalamus. The average size of these 
regions differs in the female versus the male brain. It is important 
to note, however, that these representations are based on mean 
estimates; individual variability makes it impossible to predict

dimorphism in the amygdala. The functional significance 
of this observation, however, is not known. 
In addition to these observations, several other cognitive 
tasks have been suggested to be sexually dimorphic, based 
primarily on differential patterns of activation in men's and 
women's brains seen with fMRI. In each instance, how- 
ever, the dimorphisms are statistical rather than absolute; 
therefore, performance on these tasks alone, or observation 
of the size or shape of the related structure, cannot reli- 
ably predict an individual's sex. The tasks thought to elicit 
potentially dimorphic behavior include various visuospatial 
functions, working memory, and language. Although the 
language dimorphism remains controversial, recent studies 
have replicated the primary observation that men tend to 
process language information in a more lateralized man- 
ner, with greater activation of left hemisphere regions (see 
Chapter 27). Parallel anatomical studies—many of which 
have not been consistently replicated—suggest differences

in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortical areas (especially the 
orbitofrontal cortex, which may be proportionally larger in 
men), parietal cortex, cingulate cortex, and temporal cor- 
tices related to audition and language (see Figure 30.15). 
While suggestive, none of these observations demonstrate 
consistent and robust sex differences in cognitive functions 
or related brain regions. Certainly, none of these putative 
dimorphisms can be used reliably to distinguish or pre- 
dict—or to limit—the performance of girls and boys (or 
women and men) on any behavioral task beyond those 
genotype/phenotype-dependent behaviors directly related 
to reproduction and parenting. This conclusion does not 
mean that such differences do not exist (indeed, many 
would argue that they do); however, it leaves substantial 
doubt as to whether any observed behavioral differences 
other than those pertinent to reproduction and parenting 
are established as a direct consequence of genotypic and 
phenotypic sex. 
Summary 
Throughout the animal kingdom, the brains of male and 
female individuals are specialized for the division of behav- 
ioral tasks that deal with reproduction and the rearing of 
offspring. In mammals, the strongest determinant of these 
differences is the initial differentiation of gonadal tissues, 
under the control of the masculinizing transcription factor 
Sry. Sry determines an individual's genetic sex, and usually 
the phenotypic sex as well, but it is not expressed in the 
brain. The influence of Sry on the nervous system is thus 
indirect: Sry-mediated masculinization leads to differen- 
tial production of gonadal tissues and thus to sex-specific 
levels of circulating gonadal hormones (estrogen and tes- 
tosterone in particular). These hormones profoundly influ- 
ence the development of brain structures that subserve the 
peripheral structures (genitalia, mammary glands) directly 
related to reproduction and parenting. These central struc- 
tures include groups of motor neurons in the spinal cord 
as well as distinct subsets of neurons in the anterior and 
medial hypothalamus. The activity of these neurons is di- 
rectly related to mating behaviors (cyclic ovulation, sexual 
arousal, intromission, ejaculation) and/or primary parent- 
ing behaviors (food consumption during pregnancy, nurs- 
ing), and the structures in which these neurons are located 
are anatomically dimorphic in males and females. Some of 
these dimorphisms reflect trophic regulation of cell survival 
and death in relevant structures based on anatomical dif- 
ferences in the peripheral organs that these cells innervate 
or regulate (male and female genitalia, mammary glands 
in females, and related muscles). The existence and func- 
tional significance of dimorphisms related to distinctions in 
gender identity and sexual orientation remain controversial. 
These differences, while clearly biologically based, are not 
likely to be simply related to dimorphisms that coordinate

MEMORY 
Overview 
ONE OF THE MOST INTRIGUING of the brain's complex functions is the abil- 
ity to store information provided by experience and to retrieve much of it, either 
consciously or unconsciously. Without this ability, many of the cognitive functions 
discussed in the preceding chapters could not occur. Learning is the name given to 
the process by which new information is acquired by the nervous system and is ob- 
servable through changes in behavior. Memory refers to the encoding, storage, and 
retrieval of learned information. Equally important is the normal ability to forget 
information that is only temporarily useful. Amnesia, which is the pathological for- 
getting of previously stored information and/or the inability to store new information, 
has been especially instructive about the neurological underpinnings of memory. 
The importance of memory in daily life has made understanding these several phe- 
nomena one of the major challenges of modern neuroscience, a challenge that has 
only begun to be met. The mechanisms of plasticity that provide plausible cellular 
and molecular bases for information storage were considered in Chapter 8 and in 
Chapters 23-25. The present chapter summarizes the broader organization of human 
memory, surveys the major clinical manifestations of memory disorders, and consid- 
ers the implications of these disorders for ultimately understanding human memory. 
Qualitative Categories of Human Memory 
Humans have at least two qualitatively different systems of information storage, 
generally referred to as declarative memory and nondeclarative memory (Figure 31.1; 
also see Box 31A). Declarative memory is the storage and retrieval of material 
that is available to consciousness and can in principle be expressed by language 
(i.e., "declared"). Examples of declarative memory are the ability to remember a 
phone number, the words to a song, or a past event. N ondeclarative memory (also 
referred to as procedural memory) is not available to consciousness, at least not 
in any detail. Such memories involve skills and associations that are, by and large, 
acquired and retrieved at an unconscious level. Knowing how to use your phone 
or how to sing a song are examples of nondeclarative memories. It is difficult or 
impossible to describe exactly how we do these things, and thinking about how to

The major qualitative cat- 
egories of human memory. Declarative 
memory includes those memories that can 
be brought to consciousness and expressed 
as remembered events, images, sounds, 
etc. Nondeclarative, or procedural, memory 
includes motor skills, cognitive skills, simple 
classical conditioning, priming effects, and 
other information that is acquired and 
retrieved unconsciously.

carry out such automatic activities may actually inhibit the 
ability to perform them efficiently. As discussed later in 
this chapter, the distinction between declarative and non- 
declarative memory is strongly supported by clinical and 
other evidence (see Box 31C, for example). 
Although it makes good sense to divide human learn- 
ing and memory into categories based on the accessibility 
of stored information to conscious awareness, this distinc- 
tion becomes problematic when considering learning and 
memory processes in non-human animals. From an evolu- 
tionary point of view, it is of course unlikely that declarative 
memory arose de novo in humans with the development of 
language. Although some researchers favor different clas- 
sification systems for humans as opposed to other animals, 
recent studies suggest that similar memory processes oper- 
ate in all mammals and that these learning and memory 
functions are subserved by homologous neural circuitry. In 
non-human mammals, declarative memory typically refers 
to information that they are aware if and could be declared if 
the species in question had this ability. Another criterion of 
declarative memory in non-human animals is dependence 
on the integrity of the medial temporal lobe (see below). 
Nondeclarative memory, in humans and other animals alike, 
can be thought of as the acquisition and storage of neural 
associations and motor skills that are unconscious and not 
dependent on the medial temporal portions of the brain.

Temporal Categories of Memory 
In addition to the types of memory defined by the nature of 
what is remembered, memory can also be categorized ac- 
cording to the time over which it is effective. Although the 
details are still debated by both psychologists and neuro- 
biologists, three temporal classes of memory are generally 
accepted (Figure 31.2). The first of these is immediate mem- 
ory. By definition, immediate memory is the routine ability to 
hold ongoing experiences in mind for fractions of a second. 
The capacity of immediate memory is very large, and each 
sensory modality (visual, auditory, tactile, and so on) appears 
to have its own semi-independent "memory register." 
Working memory, the second temporal category, is 
the ability to hold and manipulate information in mind for 
seconds to minutes while it is used to achieve a particular 
goal (such processes are sometimes referred to as "short- 
term memory"). An everyday example is searching for a 
lost object; working memory allows the hunt to proceed 
efficiently, avoiding places already inspected. A conven- 
tional way of testing the integrity of working memory at 
the bedside is to present a string of randomly ordered digits, 
which the patient is then asked to repeat. The normal "digit 
memory span" is only 7-9 numbers, and even these are 
rapidly forgotten. 
Because working memory is limited in both duration and 
capacity, the relevant information must be continuously 
(days-years)

considered to be a special category of attention that op- 
erates on internal representations rather than on sensory 
input as such. It is also pertinent to language, reasoning, 
and problem-solving, as the example of searching for a lost 
item makes plain. Thus, working memory influences and 
is influenced by many other aspects of brain function. Al-

of declarative memory, it must also operate in the acquisi- 
tion and ultimate storage of nondeclarative information. 
The third temporal category is long-term memory and 
entails retaining information in a more permanent form 
of storage for days, weeks, or even a lifetime. Informa- 
tion of particular significance in immediate and working 
memory can enter into long-term memory by conscious 
or unconscious rehearsal or practice, although most is 
forgotten. There is general agreement that the so-called

depends on changes in the efficacy of 
synaptic connections and/or the actual 
growth and reordering of such connec- 
tions. As discussed in Chapter 8, there 
is ample evidence that mechanisms of 
synaptic change can and do act over each 
of the temporal intervals pertinent to the 
different endurance of memories in these 
several classes. 
Memory Consolidation 
and Priming 
The way in which immediate and short- 
term (working) memories are gradually 
encoded as long-term memories is called 
memory consolidation. One approach 
to exploring the continual transfer of in- 
formation from immediate and short- 
term memory to long-term memory is in 
the context of priming. Priming is defined 
formally as a change in the processing of 
a stimulus due to a previous encounter 
with the same or a related stimulus with 
or without conscious awareness of the 
original encounter. The phenomenon is typically demon- 
strated by presenting subjects with a set of items to which 
they are exposed under false pretenses. For example, a list 
of words can be given with the instruction that the subjects 
are to identify some feature that is actually extraneous to the 
experiment (e.g., identifying the words as verbs, adjectives, 
or nouns). Sometime thereafter (e.g., the next day) the same 
individuals are given a different test in which they are asked 
to fill in the missing letters of words with the letters of what- 
ever words come to mind (Figure 31.3) The test list actually 
includes fragments of words that were presented in the first 
test, mixed among fragments of words that were not. Sub- 
jects fill in the letters to make the words that were presented 
earlier at a higher rate than expected by chance, even though 
they have little or no conscious memory of the words that 
were seen initially; moreover, they are faster at filling in let- 
ters to make words that were seen earlier than new words. 
The information stored in priming, however, is not par- 
ticularly reliable. Consider, the list of words in Table 31.1A. 
If the list is read to a group of students who are immediately 
asked to identify which of several items were on the original 
list and which were not (Table 31.1B), the result is surpris- 
ing. Typically, about half the students report that the word 
"sweet" was included in the list in Table 31.1A; moreover, 
they are quite certain about it. The mechanism of such erro- 
neous "recognition" is presumably the strong associations 
that have previously been made between the words on the

students to think that "sweet" was a member of the original 
set. Clearly, memories, even those we feel quite confident 
about, are often false. 
Priming is resistant to brain injury, aging, and dementia. 
Asa 
result, its contributions are less obvious (and less easily 
studied) than other forms of memory that are compromised 
by specific brain insults, such as impaired declarative mem- 
ory following damage to the medial temporal lobes (see be- 
low). Among other things, priming shows that information 
previously presented is always influential, even though we 
are entirely unaware of its effect on subsequent behavior. 
The significance of priming is well known—at least intui- 
tively—to advertisers, teachers, spouses, and others who 
want to influence the way we think and act. 
The Importance of Association 
in Information Storage 
The normal human capacity for remembering relatively 
meaningless information is surprisingly limited (as noted, a 
string of 7-9 numbers or other arbitrary items). This stated 
capacity, however, is misleading. People can remember 14 
or 15 items in a briefly presented 5x5 matrix of 25 num- 
bers or other objects if the experimenter points to specific 
boxes in the blank matrix during recall testing. Moreover, a 
person's digit memory span can be increased dramatically

with practice. For example, a college student who for some 
months spent an hour each day being paid to successfully 
remember randomly presented numbers was able to recall 
a string of up to about 80 digits (Figure 31.4). He did this by 
making subsets of the string of numbers he was given signify 
dates or times at track meets (he was a competitive runner) — 
in essence, giving meaningless items a meaningful context. 
This same strategy of association is used by professional 
"mnemonists" who amaze audiences by prodigious feats 
of memory. A challenge for some mnemonists is memoriz- 
ing as many as possible of the infinite number of digits in

months involving 1 hour of practice each day for 3-5 days a

second. If a sequence was recalled correctly, 1 digit was added to 
the next sequence. (After Ericsson et al., 1980.)

the mathematical entity 1 (3.1416... 1). The current world 
record is over 67,000 decimal places. The mnemonists who 
hold such records use a variety of associational strategies, a 
common one being associating the ten digits involved with 
musical notes and singing the number string. 
The capacity of memory very much depends on what 
the information in question means to the individual and 
how readily it can be associated with information that has 
already been stored. A good chess player can remember the 
position of many more pieces on a briefly examined board 
than an inexperienced player, presumably because the po- 
sitions have much more significance for individuals who 
understand the intricacies of the game (Figure 31.5). Arturo 
Toscanini, the late conductor of the NBC Philharmonic Or- 
chestra, who allegedly kept in his head the complete scores 
of more than 250 orchestral works, as well as the music and 
librettos for some 100 operas. Once, just before a concert 
in St. Louis, the first bassoonist approached Toscanini in 
some consternation, having just discovered that one of the 
keys on his bassoon was broken. After a minute or two of 
deep concentration, the story goes, Toscanini turned to the 
alarmed bassoonist and informed him that there was no 
* need for concern, since that note did not appear in any of 
the bassoon parts for the evening's program. Such feats of 
memory are not achieved by rote learning but are a result 
of the fascination that aficionados bring to their special in- 
terests (Box 31B). 
Such examples indicate that motivation also plays an im- 
portant role in memory. In one study of this issue, experi- 
menters asked subjects to study a set of photographs that 
depicted either pieces of furniture or pieces of food (Figure 
31.6). The subjects were later tested with a much larger set 
of photographs that included images from the previously 
studied set along with new ones; the subjects were asked 
to indicate whether a picture was "old" or "new." In one 
condition, the experimenters increased subjects' hunger by 
depriving them of food for several hours. Predictably, sub- 
jects were much more likely to remember more pictures of 
food when they were hungry than when they were sated. 
There was no effect of motivation on memory for pictures 
of furniture. 
Although few can boast the mnemonic prowess of a x 
enthusiast or a Toscanini, the human ability to remember 
the things that deeply interest us—whether baseball sta- 
tistics, soap opera plots, or even the details of brain struc- 
ture—is nothing short of amazing. 
Conditioned Learning 
Conditioned learning is the category of nondeclarative 
memory acquisition that has been most intensively studied 
over the past century, from both psychological and neuro- 
biological perspectives. Conditioned learning can be de- 
fined as the generation of a novel response that is gradually

CHAPTER 31 
BOX 31B Savant Syndrome 
_ A fascinating developmental anomaly 
_ of human memory is seen in rare indi- 
_ viduals who until recently were referred 
_ to as idiots savants; the current literature 
_ tends to use the less pejorative phrase 
_ savant syndrome. Savants are people 
who, for a variety of poorly understood 
_ reasons (typically brain damage in the 
_ perinatal period), are severely restricted 
_ in most mental activities but extraor- 
_ dinarily competent and mnemonically 
- capacious in one particular domain. The 
_ grossly disproportionate skill compared 
to the rest of their limited mental life 
can be striking. Indeed, these indi- 
viduals—whose special talent may be 
in calculation, history, art, language, 
or music—are usually diagnosed as 
severely retarded. 
Many examples could be cited, but 
_ asummary of one such case suffices to 
make the point. The individual whose 
history is summarized here was given 
the fictitious name "Christopher" in 
a detailed study carried out by psy- 
_ chologists Neil Smith and Ianthi-Maria 
Tsimpli. Christopher was discovered to 
be severely brain damaged at just a few 
weeks of age (perhaps as the result of 
rubella during his mother's pregnancy or 
anoxia during birth; the record is uncer- 
tain in this respect). He had been insti- 
tutionalized since childhood because he 
was unable to care for himself, could not 
find his way around, had poor hand-eye 
coordination, and a variety of other 
deficiencies. Tests on standard IQ scales 
were low, consistent with his general 
inability to cope with daily life. Scores 
on the Wechsler Scale were, on different 
occasions, 42, 67, and 52. 
Despite his severe mental inca- 
pacitation, Christopher took an intense 
interest in books from the age of about 
3, particularly those providing factual 
information and lists (e.g., telephone 
directories and dictionaries). At about 
age 6 or 7 he began to read techni- 
cal papers that his sister sometimes 
brought home from work, and he 
showed a surprising proficiency in for- 
eign languages. His special talent in 
the acquisition and use of language (an 
area in which savants are often espe- 
cially limited) grew rapidly. As an early 
teenager, Christopher could translate 
from—and communicate in—a variety 
of languages in which his skills were 
described as ranging from rudimen- 
tary to fluent; these included Danish, 
Dutch, Finnish, French, German, mod- 
ern Greek, Hindi, Italian, Norwegian, 
Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, 
Swedish, Turkish, and Welsh. This 
extraordinary level of linguistic accom- 
plishment is all the more remarkable 
since he had no formal training in lan- 
guage even at the elementary school 
level, and could not play tic-tac-toe 
or checkers because he was unable to 
grasp the rules needed to make moves 
in these games. 
The neurobiological basis for such 
) 
extraordinary individuals is not under- 
stood. It is fair to say, however, that 
savants are unlikely to have ability in 
their areas of expertise that exceeds 
the competency of normally intelligent 
individuals who focus passionately on 
a particular subject. Presumably, the 
savant's intense interest in a particular 
cognitive domain is due to one or more 
brain regions that continue to work rea- 
sonably well. Whether because of social 
feedback or self-satisfaction, savants 
clearly spend a great deal of their men- 
tal time and energy practicing the skill 
they can exercise more or less normally. 
The result is that the relevant associa- 
tions they make become especially rich, 
as Christopher's case demonstrates.

elicited by repeatedly pairing a novel stimulus with a stimu- 
lus that normally elicits the response being studied. 
There are two broad forms of conditioned learning, 
classical and operant conditioning. Classical condition- 
ing occurs when an innate reflex is modified by associating 
its normal triggering stimulus with an unrelated stimulus; 
by virtue of the repeated association, the unrelated stimu- 
lus eventually triggers the original response. This type of 
conditioning was famously demonstrated by the Russian 
psychologist Ivan Pavlov's experiments with dogs, carried 
out early in the twentieth century. The dogs' innate reflex 
was salivation (the unconditioned response) in reaction to the 
sight and/or smell of food (the unconditioned stimulus). The 
association was elicited in the animals by repeatedly pairing 
the sight and smell of food with the sound of a bell (the 
conditioned stimulus). The conditioned reflex was considered 
established when the conditioned stimulus (the sound of 
the bell) elicited salivation by itself (the conditioned response). 
Operant conditioning refers to the altered probability 
of a behavioral response engendered by associating the 
response with a reward (or, in some instances, a punish- 
ment). In Edward Thorndike's original experiments, car- 
ried out as part of his thesis work at Columbia University 
in the 1890s, cats learned to escape from a puzzle box by 
pressing the lever that opened the trap door to get a food 
reward. Although the cats initially pressed the lever only 
occasionally—and more or less by chance—the probability 
of their doing so increased as the animals associated this

more complete and better-known experiments performed 
a few decades later at Harvard, pigeons or rats learned to

In both classical and operant conditioning, it takes a 
number of trials for the conditioning to become established. 
If the conditioned animal performs the desired response but 
the reward is no longer provided, the conditioning gradu- 
ally disappears, a phenomenon called extinction.

Forgetting 
Some years ago, a poll showed that 84% of psychologists 
agreed with the statement "everything we learn is perma- 
nently stored in the mind, although sometimes particular 
details are not accessible." The 16% who thought otherwise 
were in fact correct. Common sense indicates that, were it 
not for forgetting, our brains would be impossibly burdened 
with the welter of useless information that is briefly encoded 
in our immediate and working memory "registers" or "buf- 
fers." In fact, the human brain is very good at forgetting. 
Like the unreliable performance on tests such as the one 
described in the example in Table 31.1, Figure 31.8 shows 
that our memory of the appearance of a penny (an icon seen 
thousands of times since childhood) is uncertain at best, and 
that people tend to gradually forget what they have encoded 
in long-term memory (the test material in the latter case was 
the content of closely followed television shows). Clearly, we 
forget things that have no particular importance, and unused 
or unrehearsed memories deteriorate over time. 
The ability to forget unimportant information may be 
as critical for normal life as the ability to retain information 
that is significant. Evidence for this presumption is dem- 
onstrated in rare individuals who have difficulty with the 
normal erasure of information. The best-known case is a 
subject studied over several decades by the Russian psy- 
chologist A. R. Luria, who referred to him simply as "S." 
Luria's description of an early encounter gives some idea 
why S, then a newspaper reporter, was so interesting: 
I gave S a series of words, then numbers, then letters, read- 
ing them to him slowly or presenting them in written form. 
He read or listened attentively and then repeated the mate- 
tial exactly as it had been presented. I increased the number 
of elements in each series, giving him as many as thirty, 
fifty, or even seventy words or numbers, but this too, pre- 
sented no problem for him. He did not need to commit any 
of the material to memory; if I gave him a series of words 
or numbers, which I read slowly and distinctly, he would

Forgetting. (A) Different versions of the "heads" 
side of a penny. Despite innumerable exposures to this familiar 
design, few people are able to select (a) as the authentic version. 
Clearly, repeated information is not necessarily retained. (B) The 
deterioration of long-term memories was evaluated in this exam- 
ple by a multiple-choice test in which the subjects were asked to 
recognize the names of television programs that had been broad- 
cast for only one season during the past 15 years. Forgetting of 
stored information that is no longer used evidently occurs gradu- 
ally and progressively over the years (chance performance = 25%).

listen attentively, sometimes ask me to stop and enunciate 
a word more clearly, or, if in doubt whether he had heard 
a word correctly, would ask me to repeat it. Usually during 
an experiment he would close his eyes or stare into space, 
fixing his gaze on one point; when the experiment was over, 
he would ask that we pause while he went over the material 
in his mind to see if he had retained it. Thereupon, without 
another moment's pause, he would reproduce the series 
that had been read to him.-

S's phenomenal memory did not always serve him well, 
however. He had difficulty ridding his mind of the trivial 
information that he tended to focus on, sometimes to the 
point of incapacitation. As Luria put it, 
Thus, trying to understand a passage, to grasp the infor- 
mation it contains (which other people accomplish by 
singling out what is most important) became a tortu- 
ous procedure for S, a struggle against images that kept 
rising to the surface in his mind. Images, then, proved 
an obstacle as well as an aid to learning in that they 
prevented S from concentrating on what was essential. 
Moreover, since these images tended to jam together, 
producing still more images, he was carried so far adrift 
that he was forced to go back and rethink the entire pas- 
sage. Consequently, a simple passage—a phrase, for that 
matter—would turn out to be a Sisyphean task.

autobiographical memory," the best known of whom is the 
television actress Marilu Henner. Although not negatively 
afflicted like Luria's patient, these individuals remember far 
more details about their daily lives; even if years in the past, 
Henner and others can remember the day of the week per- 
tinent to a given date and much of what occurred that day. 
Although forgetting is a normal and essential mental 
process, it can also be pathological, a condition called am- 
nesia, one of the causes of memory loss. An inability to es- 
tablish new memories following neurological insult is called 
anterograde amnesia, whereas difficulty retrieving memo- 
ries established prior to the precipitating neuropathology 
is called retrograde amnesia. Anterograde and retrograde 
amnesia are often present together, but can be dissociated 
under various circumstances. Amnesias following bilateral 
lesions of the temporal lobe and diencephalon have given 
particular insight into where and how at least some catego- 
ries of memory are formed and where they are stored, as 
discussed in the next section. 
Brain Systems Underlying Declarative 
Memory Acquisition and Storage 
Several extraordinary clinical cases of amnesia have been 
especially revealing about the brain systems responsible 
for the short-term storage and consolidation of declarative 
information (Box 31C). Taken together, these cases pro- 
vide dramatic evidence of the importance of midline di- 
encephalic and medial temporal lobe structures—the hip- 
pocampus, in particular—in establishing new declarative 
BOX 31C Clinical Cases Reveal an Anatomical Substrate for Declarative Memories 
The Case of H.M. 
H.M. had suffered minor seizures since 
age 10 and major seizures since age 16. 
In 1953, at the age of 27, he underwent 
surgery to correct his increasingly debil- 
itating epilepsy. A high school graduate, 
H.M. had been working as a technician 
in a small electrical business until short- 
ly before the time of his operation. His 
attacks involved generalized convul- 
sions with tongue biting, incontinence, 
and loss of consciousness (all typical of 
grand mal seizures). Despite a variety 
of medications, the seizures remained 
uncontrolled and increased in severity. 
A few weeks before his surgery, H.M. 
became unable to work and had to quit 
his job. 
On September 1, 1953, surgeons 
performed a bilateral medial temporal 
lobe resection in which the amygdala, 
uncus, hippocampal gyrus, and anterior 
two-thirds of the hippocampus were 
removed. At the time, it was unclear 
that bilateral surgery of this kind would 
cause a profound memory defect. 
Severe amnesia was evident, however, 
upon H.M.'s recovery from the opera- 
tion; and, although his epilepsy was 
well controlled, his life thereafter was 
radically changed. 
The first formal psychological exam 
of H.M. was conducted nearly 2 years 
after the operation, at which time a 
profound memory defect was still obvi- 
ous. Just before the examination, for 
instance, H.M. had been talking to the 
psychologist; yet he had no recollec- 
tion of this experience a few minutes 
later, denying that anyone had spoken 
to him. He gave the date as March 
1953 and seemed oblivious to the fact 
that he had undergone an operation, 
or that he had become incapacitated 
as a result. Nonetheless, his score on 
the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence 
Scale was 112, a value not significantly 
different from his preoperative IQ. 
Various psychological tests failed to 
reveal any deficiencies in perception, 
abstract thinking, or reasoning; he 
seemed highly motivated and, in the 
context of casual conversation, normal. 
Importantly, he also performed well on 
tests of the ability to learn new skills, 
such as mirror writing or puzzle solving 
(i.e., his ability to form nondeclarative 
memories was intact). Moreover, his 
early memories were easily recalled,

showing that the structures removed 
during H.M.'s operation are not a per- 
manent repository for such informa- 
tion. On the Wechsler Memory Scale 
(a specific test of declarative memory), 
however, he performed very poorly, 
and he could not recall a preceding test 
set once he had turned his attention to 
another part of the exam. These deficits, 
along with his obvious inability to recall 
events in his daily life, all indicated a 
profound loss of short-term declarative 
memory function. 
H.M. was studied extensively dur- 
ing the subsequent decades, primarily 
by Brenda Milner and her colleagues 
at the Montreal Neurological Institute. 
His memory deficiency continued 
unabated and, according to Milner, he 
had little idea who she was in spite of 
their acquaintance for nearly 50 years. 
Posterior 
Sadly, he gradually came to appreciate 
his predicament. "Every day is alone," 
H.M. reported, "whatever enjoyment 
I've had and whatever sorrow I've had." 
H.M. died in 2008 at age 82. 
The Case of N.A. 
N.A. was born in 1938 and grew up 
with his mother and stepfather, attend- 
ing public schools in California. After 
a year of junior college, he joined 
the Air Force. In October of 1959 he 
was assigned to the Azores as a radar 
technician and remained there until 
December 1960, when a bizarre acci- 
dent made him a celebrated neurologi- 
cal case. 
N.A. was assembling a model air- 
plane in his barracks room while, 
unbeknownst to him, his roommate 
was practicing thrusts and parries with 
cated by the red lines in (A). Image (B) is the most rostral and 
is at the level of the amygdala. The amygdala and the associ- 
ated cortex are entirely missing. Image (C) is at the level of the 
rostral hippocampus; again, this structure and the associated 
cortex have been removed. Image (D) is at the caudal level of 
the hippocampus; the posterior hippocampus appears intact, 
although somewhat shrunken. Outlines below give a clearer 
indication of the parts of H.M.'s brain that have been ablated 
(black shading). (From Corkin et al., 1997.) 
a miniature fencing foil behind N.A.'s 
chair. N.A. turned suddenly and was 
stabbed through the right nostril. The 
foil penetrated the cribriform plate (the 
structure through which the olfactory 
nerve enters the brain) and took an 
upward course into the left forebrain. 
N.A. lost consciousness within a few 
minutes (presumably because of bleed- 
ing in the region of brain injury) and 
was taken to a hospital. There he exhib- 
ited right-side weakness and paralysis 
of the right eye muscles innervated 
by the third cranial nerve. Exploratory 
surgery was undertaken and the dural 
tear repaired. Gradually, he recov- 
ered and was sent home to California. 
After some months, his only general 
neurological deficits were some weak- 
ness of upward gaze and mild double 
vision, He retained, however, a severe 
anterograde amnesia for-declarative 
memories. MRI studies first carried out 
in 1986 showed extensive damage to 
the thalamus and nearby tracts, mainly 
on the left side; there was also damage 
to the right anterior temporal lobe. The 
exact extent of his lesion, however, is 
not known, as N.A. remains alive and 
well. 
N.A.'s memory from the time of his 
injury (over 40 years ago) to the pres- 
ent has remained impaired and, like 
H.M., he fails badly on formal tests 
_ 
of new learning ability. His IQ is 124, 
and he shows no defects in language 
skills, perception, or other measures 
of intelligence. He also learns new

nondeclarative skills quite normally, His 
_ amnesia is not as dense as that of H.M. 
and is more verbal than spatial. He can, 
for example, draw accurate diagrams 
_ 
of material presented to him earlier. 
_ Nonetheless, he loses track of his pos- 
sessions, forgets what he has done, and 
tends to forget who has come to visit 
him. He has only vague impressions of 
_ 
political, social, and sporting events that 
have occurred since his injury. When 
watching television, he tends to forget 
_ 
the story line during commercials. On 
the other hand, his memory for events 
prior to 1960 is extremely good; indeed, 
his lifestyle tends to reflect the 1950s. 
The Case of R.B. 
At the age of 52, R.B. suffered an isch- 
emic episode during cardiac bypass 
surgery. Following recovery from anes- 
thesia, a profound amnesic disorder 
was apparent. As in the cases of H.M. 
and N.A., his IQ was normal (111) and 
he showed no evidence of cognitive 
defects other than memory impair- 
ment. R.B. was tested extensively for 
the next 5 years and, while his amnesia 
was not as severe as that of H.M. or 
N.A., he consistently failed the stan- 
dard tests of the ability to establish new 
declarative memories. When R.B. died 
of congestive heart failure in 1983, a 
detailed examination of his brain was 
carried out. The only significant finding 
was bilateral lesions of the hippocam- 
pus—specifically, cell loss in the CA1 
region that extended the full rostral- 
caudal length of the hippocampus on 
both sides. The amygdala, thalamus, 
and mammillary bodies, as well as 
the structures of the basal forebrain, 
were normal. R.B.'s case is particularly 
important because it suggests that 
hippocampal lesions alone can result 
in profound anterograde amnesia for 
declarative memory. 
The Case of K.C. 
As a young man, K.C. had a motorcycle 
accident in which he sustained dam- 
age to several brain regions, includ- 
ing the hippocampus (Figure E). As 
with the other patients described here, 
(E) 
K.C.'s intellectual abilities were well 
preserved; he is able to read, write, and 
play chess at much the same level as 
before his accident (Figure F). However, 
both his anterograde and retrograde 
episodic memory are severely impaired. 
Unlike H.M., K.C.'s retrograde 
amnesia covers his whole life and he 
can remember little, if any, any per- 
sonal history. Nonetheless, his memory 
for semantic information acquired 
before the accident is intact. He has a 
good vocabulary, and his knowledge 
of subjects such as mathematics, his- 
tory, and geography is not greatly 
different from that of others with his 
educational background. K.C.'s case 
thus exemplifies how extensive medial 
temporal lobe damage can, in at least 
some cases, impair retrograde epi- 
sodic memory while sparing retrograde 
semantic memory. It could be that K.C.'s 
general knowledge was acquired earlier 
than the episodic memories tested and 
hence was more consolidated and less 
dependent on the hippocampus and

can readily retrieve semantic informa- 
tion (e.g., the meaning of highly techni- 
cal terms) he acquired while working as 
a machinist, whereas he fails to remem-

during the same time period.

Brain areas that support declarative

and dorsal thalamus. (B) Location of the hippocampus

memories (Figure 31.9). These patients also dem- 
onstrate that there is a different anatomical sub- 
strate for anterograde and retrograde amnesia, 
since in each of these individuals, memories for 
events and other information acquired before the 
brain damage they suffered was largely retained. 
Thus, this sort of injury produces primarily an- 
terograde amnesia. 
Studies of animals with lesions of the medial 
temporal lobe have largely corroborated these 
findings in human patients. For example, one test 
of the presumed equivalent of declarative memory 
formation in animals involves placing rats into a 
pool filled with opaque water, thus concealing a 
submerged platform; note that the pool is sur- 
rounded by prominent visual landmarks (Figure 
31.10). Normal rats at first search randomly until 
they find the submerged platform. After repeated 
testing, however, they learn to swim directly to 
the platform no matter where they are initially 
placed in the pool. Rats with lesions to the hip- 
pocampus and nearby structures-cannot learn to 
find the platform, suggesting that remembering 
its location relative to the configuration of visual 
landmarks depends on the same neural structures 
critical to declarative memory formation in hu- 
mans. Likewise, destruction of the hippocampus 
and parahippocampal gyrus in monkeys severely 
impairs their ability to perform delayed-response 
tasks (see Figure 26.17). These studies suggest that 
primates and other mammals depend on medial 
temporal structures such as the hippocampus and 
parahippocampal gyrus to encode and consolidate 
memories of events and objects in time and space, 
just as humans use these same brain regions for 
the initial encoding and consolidation of declara- 
tive memories.

that neurons in these areas are selectively recruited by tasks 
that involve declarative memory formation. For example, 
neuroimaging studies using positron emission tomography 
show increased metabolism in the hippocampus of human 
subjects studying information they would later be asked to 
recall. fMRI studies have also shown that the hippocampus 
and parahippocampal cortex are activated in human sub- 
jects studying a list of items to be remembered. The amount 
of activity measured in these areas was higher for items 
that subjects subsequently remembered compared with the 
activity measured for items they later forgot (Figure 31.11).

has ridden a taxi in a large city can appreciate the difficulty 
of negotiating the labyrinth of streets to finally arrive at a 
specified destination. Studies have shown that that the pos- 
terior hippocampus, which appears to be particularly useful 
in remembering spatial information, is larger in London taxi 
drivers than in age-matched controls (Figure 31.12A). Con- 
firming the role of experience in performance, the size of the 
posterior hippocampus in cab drivers scales positively with 
the number of months spent driving a cab (Figure 31.12B). 
Together, such findings endorse the idea that neuronal ac- 
tivation within the hippocampus and closely allied cortical 
areas of the medial temporal lobe largely determines the 
transfer of declarative information into long-term memory, 
and that the robustness with which such memories are en- 
coded depends on structural and functional changes that 
occur as a result of experience.

Retrograde amnesia—the loss of memory for events 
preceding an injury or illness—is more typical of the gen- 
eralized lesions associated with head trauma and neurode- 
generative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (see Box 
31D). Although a degree of retrograde amnesia can occur 
with the more focal lesions that cause anterograde amne- 
sia, the long-term storage of memories is presumably dis- 
tributed throughout the brain (see the following sections). 
Thus, the hippocampus and related diencephalic structures 
indicated in Figure 31.9 are critical for the formation and

consolidation of declarative memories that are ultimately 
stored elsewhere. 
Revealing though they have been, clinical studies of am- 
nesic patients have provided relatively little insight into the 
long-term storage of declarative information in the brain, 
other than to indicate quite clearly that such information is 
not stored in the midline diencephalic and medial temporal 
lobe structures that are affected in anterograde amnesia. A 
good deal of evidence accumulated over the years implies 
that the cerebral cortex is the major long-term repository 
for many aspects of declarative memory. 
The idea that memory traces are distributed over the 
cortex began with the work of the American neuroscientist 
Karl Lashley in the 1920s. Lashley made cuts that discon- 
nected various regions of the cortex in rats, performing this 
procedure either before or after the animals had learned 
to run mazes of varying difficulty. When the cuts he made 
failed to show much effect on the animals' memory of how 
to find the food reward in the maze, he went on to ac- 
tually remove parts of the cortex (Figure 31.13A). Lashley 
found that in fact the location of the lesions did not matter 
much—only the extent of the tissue destruction and the dif- 
ficulty of the task seemed consequential (Figure 31.13B,C). 
He summarized his findings in terms of what he called the 
mass action principle, which states that any degradation in 
learning and memory depends on the amount of cortex 
destroyed; and that the more complex the learning task, 
the more disruptive the lesion. Only when the damage is 
widespread does network performance show a significant 
decline. These findings imply that, whereas acquiring de- 
clarative memories depends on the integrity of the medial

temporal lobes, storing them over the long term depends 
on a distributed cortical network that is seriously impaired 
only when large portions of it are destroyed. 
A second line of evidence supporting this interpretation 
comes from patients with severe depression who undergo 
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The passage of enough 
electrical current through the brain causes the equivalent 
of a full-blown seizure. This remarkably useful treatment 
(which is performed under anesthesia in well-controlled 
circumstances) was discovered because depression in

epileptics often remitted after a spontaneous seizure (see 
Box 8C). However, ECT often causes both anterograde and 
retrograde amnesia. Patients typically do not remember the 
treatment itself or the events of the preceding days, and 
their recall of events over the previous 1-3 years can be 
affected. Animal studies (e.g., rats tested for maze learn- 
ing) have confirmed the amnesic consequences OLECE To 
mitigate this side effect (which may be the result of exci- 
totoxicity and tends to resolve over a few months; see Box 
6C), ECT is often delivered to only one hemisphere at a 
time. The nature of amnesia following ECT supports the

conclusion that long-term declarative memories are widely 
stored in the cerebral cortex, since this is the part of the 
brain predominantly affected by this therapy. 
Another line of evidence comes from patients with dam- 
age to regions of the association cortex. Since different corti- 
cal regions have significantly different if overlapping func- 
tions (see Chapters 26 and 27), it is not surprising that these 
sites store information that reflects their function. For exam- 
ple, the lexicon that links speech sounds and their symbolic 
significance is located in the association cortex of the superior 
temporal lobe, and damage to this area typically results in an 
inability to link words and meanings (Wernicke's aphasia; 
see Chapter 27). Presumably, the widespread connections 
of the hippocampus to the language areas serve to transfer 
declarative information to these and other language-related 
cortical sites (Figure 31.14). By the same token, the inability 
of patients with temporal lobe lesions to remember and thus 
recognize objects and/or faces suggests that such memories 
are stored in these sites (see Chapter 26). 
One more line of support for the hypothesis that declar- 
ative memories are stored in cortical areas specialized for 
processing particular types of information comes from neu- 
roimaging of human subjects recalling vivid memories. In 
one such study, subjects first examined words paired with 
either pictures or sounds. Their brains were then scanned 
while they were asked to recall whether each test word was 
associated with either a picture or a sound. Functional im- 
ages based on these scans showed that the cortical areas 
activated when subjects viewed pictures or heard sounds 
were reactivated when these percepts were vividly recalled.

because these connections are much 
better documented in non-human pri-

numerous cortical areas converge on

memory; most of these sites also send 
projections to the same cortical areas. 
Medial and lateral views are shown, the 
latter rotated 180° for clarity. (After Van 
Hoesen, 1982.) 
In fact, this sort of reactivation can be quite specific. Thus, 
different classes of visual images—such as faces, houses, or 
chairs—tend to reactivate the same regions of the visual as- 
sociation cortex that were activated when the objects were 
actually perceived (Figure 31.15). 
Retrieving memories appears to involve the association 
cortices, the frontal cortex in particular. Thus, dorsolateral 
and anterolateral frontal cortical areas are activated when 
normal subjects attempt to retrieve de- 
clarative information from long-term

Widespread projections from association

The output of the hippocampus is ultimately 
directed back to these same neocortical areas. 
Finally, whereas the ability of patients such as H.M. and 
R.B. to remember facts and events from the period of their 
lives preceding their lesions demonstrates that the medial 
temporal lobe is not necessary for retrieving declarative in- 
formation held in long-term memory, other studies suggest 
that these structures may be important for recalling declara- 
tive memories during the early stages of consolidation and 
storage in the cerebral cortex.

Brain Systems Underlying 
Nondeclarative Memory 
Acquisition and Storage 
It is important to note that patients such as H.M., N.A.,, 
and R.B. had no difficulty establishing or recalling nonde- 
clarative memories, indicating that such information is laid 
down using a different anatomical substrate from that used 
in declarative memory formation. Nondeclarative memory 
apparently involves the basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, 
amygdala, sensory association cortices, and cerebellum— 
but not the medial temporal lobe or midline diencephalon. 
In support of this view, perceptual priming (the influence of 
previously studied information on subsequent performance, 
unavailable to conscious recall) depends critically on the in- 
tegrity of sensory association cortex. For example, lesions of 
the visual association cortex produce profound impairments 
in visual priming but leave declarative memory formation 
intact. Likewise, simple sensory-motor conditioning, such 
as learning to blink following a tone that predicts a puff 
of air directed at the eye, relies on the normal activation 
of neural circuits in the cerebellum. Ischemic damage to 
the cerebellum following infarcts of the superior cerebellar 
artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery causes pro- 
found deficits in classical eye-blink conditioning but does 
not interfere with the ability to lay down new declarative 
memories. Evidence from such "double dissociations" en- 
dorses the idea that relatively independent brain systems 
govern the formation and storage of declarative and non- 
declarative memories. 
A region of the brain that appears to be especially impor- 
tant for complex motor learning involves the connections 
(A)

MEMORY 
711 
between the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex (see Chap- 
ter 18). Damage to either structure interferes with the abil- 
ity to learn new motor skills. Patients with Huntingtons 
disease, which causes atrophy of the caudate and putamen 
(see Figure 18.9B), perform poorly on motor skill learn- 
ing tests such as manually tracking a spot of light, tracing 
curves using a mirror, or reproducing sequences of finger 
movements. Because the loss of dopaminergic neurons in 
the substantia nigra interferes with normal signaling in the 
basal ganglia (see Figure 18.10A), patients with Parkinson's 
disease show similar deficits in motor skill learning (Fig- 
ure 31.16), as do patients with prefrontal lesions caused by 
tumors or strokes. Neuroimaging studies have largely cor- 
roborated these findings, revealing activation of the basal 
ganglia and prefrontal cortex in normal subjects performing 
these same skill-learning tests. Activation of the basal gan- 
glia and prefrontal cortex has also been observed in animals 
as they are carrying out rudimentary motor learning and 
sequencing tasks. 
The dissociation of memory systems supporting de- 
clarative and nondeclarative memory suggests the scheme 
for long-term information storage diagrammed in Figure 
31.17. The generality of the diagram emphasizes the rudi- 
mentary state of present thinking about exactly how and 
where long-term memories are stored. A reasonable guess 
is that each complex memory is instantiated in an exten- 
sive network of neurons whose activity depends on synaptic 
weightings that have been molded and modified by previ- 
ous experience. 
In sum, a variety of evidence indicates that long-term 
memories, whether declarative or nondeclarative, are 
stored throughout the brain. This conclusion, however, 
does not imply that individual memory traces are randomly

some brain-damaged patients are impaired in very specific 
semantic or object categories, such as information about 
animals, and some forms of memory storage have been as- 
sociated with memory mechanisms in restricted brain re- 
gions, such as the localization of eye-blink conditioning in 
the cerebellum, or fear conditioning in the amygdala.

Brain size as a function of age. The human 
brain reaches its maximum size (measured by weight in this case) 
in early adult life and decreases progressively thereafter. This 
decrease evidently represents the gradual loss of neural circuitry 
in the aging brain, which presumably underlies the progressively 
diminished memory function in older individuals. (After Dekaban 
and Sadowsky, 1978.) 
Memory and Aging 
Although it is all too obvious that our outward appear- 
ance changes with age, most of us would like to believe 
that the brain is more resistant to the ravages of time. 
Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that this optimistic 
view is not justified. The average weight of the normal hu- 
man brain, determined at autopsy, steadily decreases from 
early adulthood onward (Figure 31.18). In elderly indi- 
viduals, this effect can also be observed with noninvasive 
imaging as a slight but nonetheless significant shrinkage 
of the brain. Counts of synapses in the cerebral cortex gen- 
erally decrease in old age (although the number of neu- 
rons probably does not change very much), suggesting 
that it is mainly the connections between neurons that are 
lost as humans grow old, consistent with the idea that the 
networks of connections that represent memories—the 
engrams—gradually deteriorate. 
These several observations accord with the difficulty 
older people have in making associations (e.g., remember- 
ing names or the details of recent experiences) and with 
declining scores on tests of memory as a function of age. 
The normal loss of some memory function with age means 
that clinicians must deal with a large "gray area" in dis- 
tinguishing individuals subject to normal aging from those 
suffering from age-related dementias such as Alzheimer's 
disease (Box 31D). 
Just as regular exercise slows the deterioration of the 
neuromuscular system with age, age-related neurodegen- 
eration and associated cognitive decline may be slowed in 
elderly individuals who make a special effort to continue 
using the full range of human memory abilities (i.e., both 
declarative and nondeclarative memory tasks). Although 
cognitive decline with age is ultimately inevitable, neuro- 
imaging studies suggest that high-performing older adults 
may to some degree offset declines in processing efficacy. 
Evidence suggests that they can achieve this through com- 
pensatory activation of cortical tissue that is less fully en- 
gaged during memory tasks in poorly performing older 
adults (Figure 31.19).

Dementia is a syndrome character- 
_ ized by failure of recent memory and 
other intellectual functions. It is usually 
insidious in onset but tends to progress 
steadily. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
the most common dementia, account- 
ing for 60-80% of cases in the elderly. 
This unfortunate condition afflicts 
5-10% of the U.S. population over the 
age of 65 and as much as 45% of the 
population over 85. The earliest signs 
are an impairment of recent memory 
function and attention, followed by 
failure of language skills, visual—spatial 
orientation, abstract thinking, and judg- 
ment. Alterations of personality inevita- 
bly accompany these defects. 
A tentative diagnosis of Alzheimer's 
disease is based on these characteristic 
clinical features and can be confirmed 
only by the distinctive cellular pathol- 
ogy evident on post mortem exami- 
nation of the brain (Figure A). These 
histopathological changes consist of 
three principal features: (1) collections 
of intraneuronal cytoskeletal filaments 
called neurofibrillary tangles; (2) extracel- 
lular deposits of an abnormal protein 
(called amyloid) in so-called senile

plaques; and (3) a diffuse loss of neu- 
rons, These changes are most apparent 
in neocortex, limbic structures (hippo- 
campus, amygdala, and their associated 
cortices), and some brainstem nuclei 
(typically, the basal forebrain nuclei). 
The vast majority of AD cases are 
"late-onset," arising sporadically after 
age 60. In contrast, relatively rare early- 
onset forms appear in middle life and 
are caused by monogenic defects con- 
sistent with an autosomal dominant 
pattern of inheritance. Identification of 
the mutant genes in a few families with 
the early-onset form has provided con- 
siderable insight into the processes that 
go awry in AD. 
(A)

Investigators long suspected that 
a mutant gene responsible for famil- 
ial AD might reside on chromosome 
21, primarily because clinical and 
neuropathologic features similar to 
AD often occur in individuals with 
Down syndrome (caused by an extra 
copy of chromosome 21), but with a 
much earlier onset (about age 30, in 
most cases). A mutation of the gene 
encoding amyloid precursor protein 
(APP) emerged as an attractive can- 
didate both because of the prominent 
amyloid deposits in AD together with 
isolation of a fragment of APP, AB 
peptide, from amyloid plaques. The

_ gene that encodes APP was subse- 
_ quently cloned by Dmitry Goldgaber 
and his colleagues and found to reside 
on chromosome 21. This discovery 
eventually led to the identification of 
mutations of the APP gene in almost 
- 20 families with the early-onset, auto- 
- somal dominant form of AD. It should 
- be noted, however, that only a few of 
_ the early-onset families (and none of 
_ the late-onset families) exhibited these 
_ particular mutations. 
The mutant genes underlying 
_ two additional autosomal dominant 
_ forms of AD have been subsequently 
_ identified as presenilin 1 and preseni- 
_ lin 2. Mutations of these two genes 
_ modify processing of APP and result 
_ in increased amounts of a particularly 
_ 
toxic form of AB peptide, A642. Thus, 
_ mutation of any one of several genes 
| appears to be sufficient to cause a heri- 
_ table form of AD, and these converge 
_ on abnormal processing of APP. 
In the far more common late-onset 
_ form of AD, the disease is clearly not 
inherited in any simple sense (although 
the relatives of affected individuals are 
at a greater risk, for reasons that are not 
clear). The central role of APP in the 
families with early-onset forms of the 
disease nonetheless suggested that APP 
_ might be linked to the chain of events 
culminating in the sporadic forms 
of Alzheimer's disease. Biochemists 
Warren Strittmatter and Guy Salvesen 
theorized that pathologic deposition of 
proteins complexed with AB peptide 
might be responsible. 
To test this idea, Strittmatter and 
Salvesen immobilized AB peptide on 
nitrocellulose paper and searched for 
proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid of 
patients with AD that bound with 
high affinity. One of the proteins they 
detected was apolipoprotein E (ApoE), 
a molecule that normally chaperones 
cholesterol through the bloodstream. 
This discovery was especially provoca- 
tive in light of another discovery, this 
one made by Margaret Pericak-Vance, 
Allen Roses, and their colleagues, 
who found that affected members of 
some families with the late-onset form 
of AD exhibited an association with 
genetic markers on chromosome 19. 
This finding was of particular interest 
because a gene encoding an isoform 
of ApoE is located in the same region 
of chromosome 19 implicated by the 
association studies. As a result, they 
began to explore the relationship of 
the different alleles of ApoE with 
individuals with a sporadic, late-onset 
form of AD. 
There are three major alleles of 
ApoE: e2, e3, and e4. The frequency 
of allele e3 in the general population 
| 
is 0.78, and the frequency of allele e4 
is 0.14. The frequency of the e4 allele 
in late-onset AD patients, however, is 
0.52—almost four times higher than 
in the general population. Thus, the 
inheritance of the e4 allele is a risk fac- 
tor for late-onset AD. In fact, people 
homozygous for e4 are about 8 times 
— 
more likely to develop AD compared 
with individuals homozygous for e3. 
Among individuals with no copies of e4, 
only 20% develop AD by age 75, com- 
pared with 90% of individuals with two 
copies of e4. 
In contrast to the mutations of APP 
or presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 that 
cause early-onset familial forms of AD, 
inheriting the e4 form of ApoE is not 
sufficient to cause AD; rather, inherit- 
ing this gene simply increases the risk 
of developing AD. The cellular and 
molecular mechanisms by which the e4 
allele of ApoE increases susceptibility to 
late-onset AD are not understood, and 
elucidating these mechanisms is clearly 
an important goal. 
Clearly, AD has a complex pathology 
and probably reflects a variety of related 
molecular and cellular abnormalities. 
So far, the most apparent common 
denominator seen in this complex dis- 
ease is abnormal APP processing. In 
particular, accumulation of the toxic 
A842 peptide is thought to be a key 
factor. This conclusion has led to efforts 
to develop therapies aimed at inhibit- 
ing formation or facilitating clearance 
of this toxic peptide. It is unlikely 
that this important problem will be 
understood without a great deal more 
research, the hyperbole in the lay press 
notwithstanding.

Summary 
Human memory entails a number of biological strategies 
and anatomical substrates. Primary among these are a sys- 
tem for memories that can be expressed by means of lan- 
guage and can be made available to the conscious mind 
(declarative memory) and systems that concern skills and 
associations that are essentially nonverbal, operating at a 
largely unconscious level (nondeclarative or procedural 
memory). Based on evidence from amnesic patients and 
knowledge about normal patterns of neural connections in 
the human brain, the hippocampus and associated midline 

diencephalic and medial temporal lobe structures are criti- 
cally important in acquiring and consolidating declarative 
memories, although not in storing them (storage occurs pri- 
marily in the association cortices of the brain). In contrast, 
the acquisition and consolidation of nondeclarative memo- 
ries for motor and other unconscious skills depends on the 
integrity of the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebel- 
lum and is not affected by lesions that impair the declarative 
memory system. Their storage is again widely distributed 
in these and other brain regions. The common denomina- 
tor of these categories of stored information is generally 
thought to be alterations in the strength and number of the 
synaptic connections in the cerebral cortices that mediate 
associations between stimuli and the behavioral responses 
to them.

Appendix 
SURVEY OF HUMAN 
NEUROANATOMY 
Overview 
PERHAPS THE MAJOR REASON that neuroscience remains such an exciting field is 
the wealth of unanswered questions about the fundamental organization and func- 
tion of the human brain. To understand this remarkable organ (and its interactions 
with the body that it governs), the myriad cell types that constitute the nervous 
system must be identified, their mechanisms of excitability and plasticity character- 
ized, their interconnections traced, and the physiological role of the resulting neural 
circuits defined in behaviorally meaningful contexts. These challenges have been at 
the forefront of the five units of this textbook, where a broad range of questions about 
how nervous systems are organized and how they generate behavior have been ad- 
dressed (albeit leaving many questions unanswered, especially those that pertain to 
distinctly human behaviors). This Appendix provides an anatomical framework for 
the integration of this knowledge and its application to the human nervous system. 
It provides a review of the basic terms and anatomical conventions used in discuss- 
ing human neuroanatomy, and a general picture of the organization of the human 
forebrain, brainstem, and spinal cord. The Appendix is followed by an Atlas of surface 
and sectional images of the human central nervous system on which relevant neuro- 
anatomical structures are identified. 
Neuroanatomical Terminology 
The terms used to specify location in the central nervous system are the same as 
those used for the gross anatomical description of the rest of the body (Figure A1A). 
Thus, anterior and posterior indicate, respectively, front and behind; rostral and cau- 
dal, nose and "tail" (i.e., the lower spinal region); dorsal and ventral, top and bottom 
(back and belly); and medial and lateral, at the midline or to the side. But the use of 
these coordinates in the body versus their use to describe position in the brain can 
be confusing, especially as these terms are applied to humans. For the entire body, 
these anatomical terms refer to the long axis, which is straight. The long axis of the 
human central nervous system, however, has a bend in it. In humans (and other bi- 
peds), the rostral—caudal axis of the forebrain is tilted forward (because of the cephalic 
flexure that forms in embryogenesis; see Chapter 22), with respect to the long axis of

FIGURE A1 Axes of the human nervous system. A flex- 
ure in the long axis of the nervous system arose as humans 
evolved upright posture, leading to an approximately 120° angle 
between the long axis of the brainstem and that of the forebrain. 
The consequences of this flexure for anatomical terminology are 
indicated in (A). The terms anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior 
refer to the long axis of the body, which is straight. Therefore, 
these terms indicate the same direction for both the forebrain 
and the brainstem. In contrast, the terms dorsal, ventral, rostral, 
and caudal refer to the long axis of the central nervous system. 
The dorsal direction is toward the back for the brainstem and 
spinal cord, but toward the top of the head for the forebrain. The 
opposite direction is ventral. The rostral direction is toward the 
top of the head for the brainstem and spinal cord, but toward 
the face for the forebrain. The opposite direction is caudal. (B)

the brainstem and spinal cord (see Figure A1A). Once this 
forward tilt is appreciated, the other terms that describe 
position in the brain and the terms used to identify planes 
of section can be easily assigned. 
The proper assignment of the anatomical axes dictates 
the standard planes for histological sections or live images 
that are used to study the internal anatomy of the brain and 
to localize function (Figure A1B). Horizontal sections (also 
referred to as axial sections) are taken parallel to the ros- 
tral—caudal axis of the brain; thus, in an individual standing 
upright, such sections are parallel to the ground. Sections 
taken in the plane dividing the two hemispheres are sagit- 
tal and can be further categorized as midsagittal or para- 
sagittal, according to whether the section is at the midline 
(midsagittal) or more lateral (parasagittal). Sections in the 
plane of the face are called coronal or frontal. 
Different terms are usually used to refer to sections of the 
brainstem and spinal cord. The plane of section orthogonal 
to the long axis of the brainstem and cord is the transverse, 
whereas sections parallel to this axis are longitudinal. In a 
transverse section through the human brainstem and spinal 
cord, the dorsal-ventral axis and the posterior—anterior axis 
indicate the same directions (see Figure A1A). This termi- 
nology is essential for understanding the basic subdivisions 
of the nervous system and for discussing the locations of 
brain structures in a common frame of reference. 
Basic Subdivisions of the Central 
Nervous System 
The central nervous system is usually considered to have 
seven basic parts (Figure A2). From caudal to rostral ("tail to 
nose"), these are: the spinal cord, the medulla, the pons, 
the cerebellum, the midbrain, the diencephalon, and 
the cerebrum (cerebral hemispheres). Running through 
or between these subdivisions are fluid-filled spaces called 
ventricles. These ventricles are the remnants of the con- 
tinuous lumen initially enclosed by the neural plate as it 
rounded to become the neural tube during the process of 
neurulation in early brain development (see Chapter 22). 
Variations in the shape and size of the mature ventricu- 
lar spaces are characteristic of each adult brain region. The 
medulla, pons, and midbrain are collectively called the 
brainstem; they underlie the 4th ventricle (medulla and 
pons) and surround the cerebral aqueduct (midbrain). 
The diencephalon and cerebral hemispheres are collectively 
called the forebrain, and they enclose the 3rd and lateral 
ventricles, respectively. A more detailed description of the 
ventricles is presented in a later section. 
The brainstem is one of the most complex regions of 
the central nervous system, and it too will be considered 
in greater depth below. At this juncture, suffice it to state 

that the brainstem contains the cranial nerve nuclei that 
send and receive signals via the cranial nerves, and that 
the brainstem is a conduit for several major tracts of the 
central nervous system that relay information between the 
forebrain and spinal cord, with the brainstem itself being

Accordingly, detailed knowledge of the consequences of 
damage to the brainstem provides clinicians with an es- 
sential tool in the localization and diagnosis of brain injury.

in myriad important functions, including the organization 
of rhythmical and stereotyped somatic and visceral motor 
behaviors, and transitions in states of conscious awareness 
and sleep. 
Overlying the brainstem is the cerebellum, which ex- 
tends over much of the dorsal aspect of the brainstem; to- 
gether, the brainstem and cerebellum constitute the hind- 
brain. The cerebellum is essential for the coordination and 
planning of movements (see Chapter 19) as well as learning 
motor and cognitive tasks (see Unit V). 
The forebrain has several anatomical subdivisions. The 
most obvious structures are the prominent cerebral hemi- 
spheres (Figure A3). In humans, the cerebral hemispheres 
(the outermost portions of which are continuous, highly 
folded sheets of cortex) are characterized by gyri (singular, 
gyrus), or crests of folded cortical tissue, and by sulci (sin- 
eular, sulcus), which are the grooves that divide gyri from 
one another. Although gyral and sulcal patterns vary from 
individual to individual, several consistent landmarks divide 
the hemispheres into four lobes. The names of the lobes are 
derived from the cranial bones that overlie them: occipital, 
temporal, parietal, and frontal. A key feature of the sur- 
face anatomy of the cerebrum is the central sulcus located

roughly halfway between the rostral and caudal poles of the 
hemispheres (Figure A3A). This prominent sulcus divides 
the frontal lobe in the rostral half of the hemisphere from 
the more caudal parietal lobe. Other prominent landmarks 
that divide the cerebral lobes are the lateral fissure (also 
called the Sylvian fissure), which divides the temporal 
lobe inferiorly from the overlying frontal and parietal lobes, 
and the parieto-occipital sulcus, which separates the pari- 
etal lobe from the occipital lobe. The remaining major sub- 
divisions of the forebrain are not visible from the surface; 
they comprise gray matter and white matter structures that 
lie deeper in the cerebral hemispheres and can be appreci- 
ated only in sectional views. 
Next, the characteristic superficial features of these major 
subdivisions of the human central nervous system and their 
internal organization will be described in more detail from 
caudal to rostral, beginning with the spinal cord. 
External Anatomy of the Spinal Cord 
The spinal cord extends caudally from the brainstem, run- 
ning from the medullary-spinal junction at about the level 
of the first cervical vertebra to about the level of the twelfth 
thoracic vertebra (see Figure A2). The vertebral column 
(and the spinal cord within it) is divided into cervical, tho- 
racic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal regions. The periph- 
eral nerves (called the spinal or segmental nerves) that 
innervate much of the body arise from the spinal cord's 
31 pairs of spinal nerves. On each side of the midline, the 
cervical region of the cord gives rise to 8 cervical nerves 
(C1-C8), the thoracic region to 12 thoracic nerves (T1-T12), 
the lumbar region to 5 lumbar nerves (L1—L5), the sacral 
region to 5 sacral nerves (S1-S5), and the coccygeal region 
to a single coccygeal nerve. The segmental spinal nerves 
leave the vertebral column through the intervertebral fo- 
ramina that lie adjacent to the respectively numbered verte- 
bral body. Sensory information carried by the afferent axons 
of the spinal nerves enters the cord via the dorsal roots, 
and motor commands carried by the efferent axons leave 
the cord via the ventral roots (Figure A4). Once the dorsal 
and ventral roots join, sensory and motor axons (with some 
exceptions) travel together in the segmental spinal nerves. 
Two regions of the spinal cord are enlarged to accom- 
modate the greater number of nerve cells and connections 
needed to process information related to the upper and 
lower limbs. The spinal cord expansion that corresponds to 
the arms is called the cervical enlargement and includes 
spinal segments C3-T1; the expansion that corresponds to 
the legs is called the lumbosacral enlargement and in- 
cludes spinal segments L1-S2 (see Figure A2B). Because 
the spinal cord is considerably shorter than the vertebral 
column (see Figure A2A), lumbar and sacral nerves run for 
some distance in the vertebral canal before emerging, thus 
forming a collection of nerve roots known as the cauda

equina. The cauda equina is the target for an important 
clinical procedure—the lumbar puncture—that allows for the 
collection of cerebrospinal fluid by placing a needle into the 
space surrounding these nerves to withdraw fluid for analy- 
sis. In addition, local anesthetics can be safely introduced 
into the cauda equina, producing spinal anesthesia; at this 
level, the risk of damage to the spinal cord with insertion 
of a needle is minimal. 
Internal Anatomy of the Spinal Cord 
The arrangement of gray and white matter in the spinal cord 
is relatively simple: the interior of the cord is formed by gray 
matter, which is surrounded by white matter (Figure A5A). 
In transverse sections, the gray matter is conventionally di- 
vided into dorsal (posterior) and ventral (anterior) "horns." 
The neurons of the dorsal horns receive sensory informa- 
tion that enters the spinal cord via the dorsal roots of the 
spinal nerves (Figure A5B). The lateral horns are present 
primarily in the thoracic region and contain the pregangli- 
onic visceral motor neurons that project to the sympathetic 
ganglia (visible in Figure A4). The ventral horns contain 
the cell bodies of motor neurons that send axons via the 
ventral roots of the spinal nerves to terminate on striated 
muscles. These major divisions of gray matter have been 
further subdivided according to the distribution of neurons 
in the dorsal-ventral axis.

matter, known as Rexed's laminae (see Table A1 and 
oe 
Figure 10.3B). Among the more conspicuous divisions 
are lamina II, which corresponds to the substantia 
gelatinosa and is important in pain transmission (see 
eee 
Chapter 10); and lamina IX, which contains the col- 
umns of lower motor neurons that innervate skeletal 
muscle (see Chapter 16). 
The Swedish neuroanatomist Bror Rexed recog- 
nized that neurons in the dorsal horn are organized 
_(B) 
into layers, and that neurons in the ventral horns 
(especially in the enlargements) are arranged into 
longitudinal columns (Figure A6). Rexed proposed 
a scheme for naming these subdivisions (since 
termed Rexed's laminae) that is still used by neuro- 
anatomists and clinicians, although more descrip- 
tive terms are also applied (Table A1). 
The white matter of the spinal cord is subdivided 
into dorsal (or posterior), lateral, and ventral (or an- 
terior) columns, each of which contains axon tracts 
related to specific functions. The dorsal columns 
carry ascending sensory information from somatic 
mechanoreceptors (see Figure A5B). The lateral 
columns include axons that travel from the cere- 
bral cortex to interneurons and motor neurons in 
the ventral horns; this important pathway is called 
the lateral corticospinal tract (see Chapter 17). 
The lateral columns also convey proprioceptive 
signals from spinal cord neurons to the cerebellum 
(see Chapter 19). The ventral (and ventrolateral 
or anterolateral) columns carry both ascending 
information about pain and temperature, and de- 
scending motor information from the brainstem 
and motor cortex. 
Brainstem and Cranial Nerves 
The brainstem, comprising the midbrain, pons, and me- 
dulla, is continuous rostrally with the diencephalon (thal- 
amus and hypothalamus); caudally it is continuous with 
the spinal cord. Although the medulla, pons, and midbrain 
participate in myriad specific functions, the integrated ac- 
tions of these brainstem components give rise to three 
fundamental functions. First, the brainstem is the target 
or source for the cranial nerves that deal with sensory and

motor function inthe head and neck (Table A2). Second, 
the brainstem provides a "throughway" for all of the as- 
cending sensory tracts from the spinal cord; the sensory 
tracts for the head and neck (the trigeminal system); the 
descending motor tracts from the forebrain; and local path- 
ways that link eye movement centers. Finally, the brainstem 
is involved in regulating the level of consciousness, primar- 
ily though the extensive forebrain projections of a portion of 
the brainstem core, the reticular formation (see Box 17D). 
Understanding the internal anatomy of the brainstem is 
generally regarded as essential for neurological diagnosis 
and the practice of clinical medicine. Brainstem structures 
are compressed into a relatively small volume that has a re- 
gionally restricted vascular supply. Thus, vascular accidents 
in the brainstem—which are common—tesult in distinctive, 
and often devastating, combinations of functional deficits

afferents and spinal interneurons; another source of anterolateral system 
projections 
Mainly interneurons that communicate between dorsal and ventral horns; 
in the thoracic cord, also contains projection neurons of the dorsal nucleus 
of Clarke, a spinocerebellar relay (see Chapter 19), and the sympathetic 
preganglionic neurons of the intermediolateral cell column (underlying 
the lateral horn); in the sacral cord, also contains parasympathetic 
preganglionic nuclei (see Chapter 21) 
Interneurons in the medial aspect of ventral horn that coordinate the 
activities of lower motor neurons (see Chapter 16) 
Columns of lower motor neurons that govern limb musculature 
(see Chapter 16) 
Interneurons surrounding the rudiment of the central canal 
(see below). These deficits can be used both for diagnosis 
and for better understanding of the intricate anatomy of the 
medulla, pons, and midbrain. 
Unlike the spinal cord, which is relatively homogeneous 
in appearance along its length, the surface appearance 
of each brainstem subdivision is characterized by unique 
bumps and bulges formed by the underlying gray matter

<< FIGURE A8 Cranial nerve nuclei of the brainstem. This 
"phantom" view of the brainstem's dorsal surface shows the 
locations of the brainstem nuclei that are either the target or the 
source of the cranial nerves. (See Table A2 for the relationship 
between each cranial nerve and cranial nerve nuclei, and Table 
A3 for a functional scheme that localizes cranial nerve nuclei with 
respect to brainstem subdivision and sensory or motor function.) 
With the exception of the nuclei associated with the trigeminal 
nerve, there is fairly close correspondence between the location 
of the cranial nerve nuclei in the midbrain, pons, and medulla 
and the location of the associated cranial nerves. At right, the 
territories of the major brainstem subdivisions are indicated on 
the dorsal surface. 
series of swellings on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the 
medulla reflects many of the major structures in this caudal 
part of the brainstem. One prominent landmark that can be 
seen laterally is the inferior olive. Just medial to the infe- 
rior olives are the medullary pyramids, prominent swell- 
ings on the ventral surface of the medulla that reflect the 
underlying descending corticospinal tracts (see Chapter 17). 
The pons is rostral to the medulla and is easily recog- 
nized by the mass of decussating fibers that cross (bridge) 
the midline on its ventral surface, giving rise to the name of 
this subdivision (pons is Latin for "bridge"). The cerebel- 
lum is attached to the dorsal aspect of the pons by three

large white matter tracts: the superior, middle, and infe- 
rior cerebellar peduncles. Each of these tracts contains ei- 
ther efferent (superior and inferior) or afferent (inferior and 
middle) axons from or to the cerebellum (see Chapter 19). 
The midbrain contains the superior and inferior col- 
liculi defining its dorsal surface, or tectum (Latin for "roof'"). 
Several midbrain nuclei lie in the ventral portion of the 
midbrain, including the bipartite structure, the substantia 
nigra (pars reticulata and pars compacta; see Chapter 18), 
and the red nucleus (see Chapter 19). Another notewor- 
thy anatomical feature of the midbrain is the presence of 
the prominent cerebral peduncles that are visible from 
the ventral surface; these structures are formed by massive 
projections from the cerebral cortex to a large number of 
targets in the brainstem and spinal cord. 
The surface features of the midbrain, pons, and medulla 
can be used as landmarks for locating the source and ter- 
mination of the majority of cranial nerves in the brainstem. 
Unlike the spinal nerves, the entry and exit points of the 
cranial nerves are not regularly arrayed along the length 
of the brainstem. Two cranial nerves, the olfactory nerve 
(I) and the optic nerve (II), enter the forebrain directly. 
The remaining cranial nerves enter and exit at distinct re- 
gions of the ventral (and in one case, the dorsal) surface 
of the midbrain, pons, and medulla (see Figure A7). The 
oculomotor nerve (III) exits into the space between the

two cerebral peduncles on the ventral surface of the mid- 
brain. The trochlear nerve (IV) associated with the caudal 
midbrain is the only cranial nerve to exit on the dorsal sur- 
face of the brainstem; it is also the only nerve (cranial or 
spinal) that supplies contralateral tissue. The trigeminal 
nerve (V)—the largest cranial nerve—exits the ventrolat- 
eral pons through the middle cerebellar peduncle. The ab- 
ducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII), and vestibuloco- 
chlear nerve (VIII) emerge in a medial to lateral manner, 
respectively, at the junction of the pons and medulla. The 
glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) and the vagus nerve (X) are 
associated with the lateral medulla, whereas the hypoglos- 
sal nerve (XII) exits the ventromedial medulla between the 
medullary pyramids and the inferior olive. The spinal ac- 
cessory nerve (XI) does not originate in the brainstem but, 
as its name implies, exits the lateral portion of the upper 
cervical spinal cord. Table A2 describes the major functions 
of the cranial nerves. 
Cranial nerve nuclei within the brainstem are the tar- 
gets of cranial sensory nerves or the source of cranial mo- 
tor nerves (Table A3; also see Figure A8). Cranial nerve 
nuclei that receive sensory input (analogous to the dorsal 
horns of the spinal cord) are located separately from those 
that give rise to motor output (which are analogous to the 
ventral horns). The primary sensory neurons that inner- 
vate these nuclei are found in ganglia associated with the 
cranial nerves—similar to the relationship between dorsal 
root ganglia and the spinal cord. In general, sensory nuclei 
are found laterally in the brainstem, whereas motor nuclei 
are located more medially (Figure A9). 
TABLE A3 Classification and Location of the Cranial Nerve Nuclei? 
Oculomotor 
There are three types of brainstem motor nuclei: somatic 
motor nuclei project to striated muscles; branchial motor 
nuclei project to muscles derived from embryonic struc- 
tures called branchial arches (these arches give rise to the 
muscles—and bones—of the jaws and other craniofacial 
structures); and visceral motor nuclei project to periph- 
eral ganglia that innervate smooth muscle or glandular tar- 
gets, similar to preganglionic motor neurons in the spinal 
cord that innervate autonomic ganglia. Finally, the major 
ascending or descending tracts that carry sensory or motor 
information to or from the brain are found in the lateral and 
basal regions of the brainstem. 
The rostral-caudal organization of the cranial nerve 
nuclei (all of which are bilaterally symmetric) reflects the 
rostral—-caudal distribution of head and neck structures 
(see Figure A9). The more caudal the nucleus, the more 
caudally located the target structures in the periphery. For 
example, the spinal accessory nucleus in the cervical spinal 
cord and caudal medulla provides motor innervation for 
neck and shoulder muscles, and the motor nucleus of the 
vagus nerve provides preganglionic innervation for many 
enteric and visceral targets. In the pons, the sensory and 
motor nuclei are primarily concerned with somatic sensa- 
tion from the face (the principal trigeminal nuclei) as well as 
movement of the jaws and the muscles of facial expression 
(the trigeminal motor and facial nuclei). Further rostrally, 
in the mesencephalic portion of the brainstem, are nuclei 
concerned primarily with eye movements (the oculomotor 
and trochlear nuclei) and preganglionic parasympathetic 
innervation of the iris (the Edinger-Westphal nuclei). While

APPENDIX 
this list is not complete, it indicates the basic order of the 
rostral—caudal organization of the brainstem. 
Neurologists and other healthcare professionals assess 
combinations of cranial nerve deficits to infer the location 
of brainstem lesions, or to place the source of brain dys- 
function either in the spinal cord or brain. The most com- 
mon brainstem lesions reflect the vascular territories that 
supply subsets of cranial nerve nuclei as well as ascending 
and descending tracts (see below). For example, an oc- 
clusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), 
a branch of the vertebral artery that supplies the lateral 
region of the mid- and rostral medulla, results in damage 
to three cranial nerve nuclei and several tracts (see the 
"Upper medulla" section in Figure A9). Accordingly, there 
are functional deficits that reflect the loss of the spinal tri- 
geminal nucleus, the vestibular nucleus, and the nucleus 
ambiguus (which contains branchial motor neurons that 
project to the larynx and pharynx) on the same side as the 
lesion. In addition, ascending pathways from the spinal 
cord that relay pain and temperature from the contralat- 
eral body surface are disrupted, leading to a contralateral 
loss of these functions. Finally, the inferior cerebellar pe- 
duncle, which contains projections that relay information 
about body position to the cerebellum for postural control, 
is damaged. This loss results in ataxia (clumsiness) on the 
side of the lesion. 
Anatomical relationships and shared vascularization, 
rather than any functional principle, unite these deficits 
and allow clinical localization of brainstem damage. For 
both clinicians and neurobiologists, understanding the 
brainstem requires integrating regional anatomical infor- 
mation with knowledge about functional organization and 
pathology.

Lateral Surface of the Brain 
A lateral view of the human brain is the best perspective from 
which to appreciate all four lobes of the cerebral hemisphere 
(see Figure A3A). In this view, the two most salient land- 
marks are the deep lateral fissure that separates the temporal 
lobe from the overlying frontal and parietal lobes, and the 
central sulcus, which serves as the boundary between the 
frontal and parietal lobes (Figure A10). A particularly impor- 
tant feature of the frontal lobe is the precentral gyrus. (The 
prefix pre-, when used anatomically, refers to a structure that 
is in front of or anterior to another.) The cortex of the pre- 
central gyrus is referred to as the motor cortex and contains 
neurons whose axons project to the lower motor neurons in 
the brainstem and spinal cord; these motor neurons inner- 
vate skeletal (striated) muscles (see Chapter 17). 
The superior aspect of the temporal lobe contains cor- 
tex concerned with audition and language reception, and 
inferior portions of the lobe deal with highly processed vi- 
sual information. Hidden beneath the frontal and temporal 
lobes, the insular cortex, or insula, can be seen only if 
these two lobes are pulled apart or removed (Figure A10B). 
The insular cortex is largely concerned with visceral and 
autonomic function, including taste. In the anterior parietal 
lobe just posterior to the central sulcus is the postcentral 
gyrus; this gyrus harbors cortex that is concerned with so- 
matic (bodily) sensation and is therefore referred to as the 
somatic sensory cortex (see Chapter 9). 
The boundary between the parietal lobe and the occipi- 
tal lobe, the most posterior of the hemispheric lobes, is a 
somewhat arbitrary line from the parieto-occipital sulcus to 
the preoccipital notch. The occipital lobe, only a small part 
of which is apparent from the lateral surface of the brain,

is primarily concerned with vision. In addition to their role 
in primary and sensory processing, each cortical lobe par- 
ticipates in higher brain functions related to cognition (see 
Chapter 26). Thus, the parietal lobe is critical for attending 
to stimuli, the temporal lobe is used to recognize stimuli, and 
the frontal lobe is critical in planning responses to stimuli; the 
occipital lobe is involved in all aspects of visual perception 
and may also participate in multimodal sensory processing. 
Dorsal and Ventral Surfaces 
of the Brain 
Although the primary subdivisions of the cerebral hemi- 
spheres can be appreciated from a lateral view, other key 
landmarks are better seen from the dorsal and ventral sur- 
faces. When viewed from the dorsal surface, the approximate

bilateral symmetry of the cerebral hemispheres is appar- 
ent (Figure A11). Although there is some variation, major 
landmarks such as the central sulci and parieto-occipital 
sulci are usually very similar in arrangement on the two 
sides. If the cortical hemispheres are spread slightly apart 
from the dorsal midline, another major structure, the cor- 
pus callosum, can be seen bridging the two hemispheres 
(see Figure A11C). This tract contains axons that originate

from neurons in the cerebral cortex of both hemispheres 
that contact target neurons in the opposite cortical region. 
The external features of the brain best seen on its ventral 
surface are shown in Figure A11B. Extending along the infe- 
rior surface of the frontal lobe near the midline are the olfac- 
tory tracts, which arise from enlargements at their anterior 
ends called the olfactory bulbs. The olfactory bulbs receive 
input from neurons in the epithelial lining of the nasal cavity 
whose axons make up the first cranial nerve (cranial nerve 
Lis therefore called the olfactory nerve; see Table A2). On 
the ventral—medial surface of the temporal lobe, the para- 
hippocampal gyrus conceals the hippocampus, a highly 
convoluted cortical structure that consolidates memory (see 
Chapter 31). Slightly more medial to the parahippocam- 
pal gyrus is the uncus, a conical protrusion that includes 
the cortical divisions of the amygdala. At the most central 
aspect of the ventral surface of the forebrain is the optic 
chiasm, and immediately posterior, the ventral surface of

and the mammillary bodies. Posterior to the hypothala-

of the ventral midline of the midbrain. Finally, the ventral 
surfaces of the pons, medulla, and cerebellar hemispheres 
can be seen in this ventral view (see Figure A7). 
Midsagittal Surface of the Brain 
When the brain is hemisected in the midsagittal plane, all 
of its major subdivisions plus a number of additional struc- 
tures are visible on the cut surface. In this view, the cerebral 
hemispheres, because of their great size, are still the most 
obvious structures. The frontal lobe of each hemisphere 
extends forward from the central sulcus, the medial end 
of which can just be seen (Figure A12A,B). The parieto-

aspect of the hemisphere, is most obvious in this view of 
the hemisphere as it separates the parietal and occipital 
lobes. The calcarine sulcus divides the medial surface of 
the occipital lobe, running at very nearly a right angle from 
the parieto-occipital sulcus and marking the location of the 
primary visual cortex (see Chapter 12). A long, roughly 
horizontal sulcus, the cingulate sulcus, extends across the 
medial surface of the frontal and parietal lobes. The gyrus 
below it, the cingulate gyrus, is a prominent component of 
the limbic system, which comprises cortical and subcorti- 
cal structures in the frontal and temporal lobes that form a 
medial rim of cerebrum roughly encircling the corpus cal- 
losum and diencephalon (limbic means border or rim). The 
limbic system is important in the experience and expression 
of emotion, as well as the regulation of visceral motor activ- 
ity (see Chapter 29). Finally, ventral to the cingulate gyrus is 
the cut, midsagittal surface of the corpus callosum. 
Although parts of the diencephalon, brainstem, and cer- 
. 
ebellum are visible at the ventral surface of the brain, their 
overall structure is especially clear from the midsagittal sur- 
face (Figure A12C). From this perspective, the diencephalon 
can be seen to consist of two parts. The dorsal thalamus, 
the largest component of the diencephalon, comprises a 
number of subdivisions, all of which relay information to 
the cerebral cortex from other parts of the brain (Box A). 
The hypothalamus—a small but crucial part of the dien- 
cephalon—is devoted to the control of homeostatic and 
reproductive functions, among other diverse activities (see 
Box 21A). The hypothalamus is intimately related, both 
structurally and functionally, to the pituitary gland, a criti- 
cal endocrine organ whose posterior part is connected to 
the hypothalamus by the infundibulum. 
The midbrain tegmentum, which can be seen only in 
this view, lies caudal to the thalamus, and the pons is cau- 
dal to the midbrain. The cerebellum lies over the pons just

beneath the occipital lobe of the cerebral hemispheres. 
From the midsagittal surface, the most visible feature of the 
cerebellum is the cerebellar cortex, a continuous layered 
sheet of cells folded into ridges and valleys called folia. The 
most caudal structure seen from the midsagittal surface of 
the brain is the medulla, which merges into the spinal cord. 
Internal Anatomy of the Forebrain 
A much more detailed neuroanatomical picture of the 
forebrain is apparent in gross or histological slices. In these 
slices (or sections), deep structures that are not visible from 
any brain surface can be identified. In addition, relation- 
ships between brain structures seen from the surface can 
be appreciated more fully. The major challenge to under- 
standing the internal anatomy of the brain is to integrate 
the rostral—caudal, dorsal—ventral, and medial—lateral land- 
marks seen on the brain surface with the position of struc- 
tures seen in brain sections taken in the horizontal, frontal, 
and sagittal planes. This challenge is not only important 
for understanding brain function; it is essential for inter- 
preting noninvasive images of the brain, most of which are 
displayed as sections. 
In any plane of section through the forebrain, the cere- 
bral cortex is evident as a thin layer of neural tissue that 
covers the entire cerebrum. Most cerebral cortex is made up 
of six layers and is referred to as neocortex (see Box 26A). 
Phylogenetically older cortex (paleocortex) with fewer cell 
layers occurs on the inferior and medial aspect of the tem- 
poral lobe within the parahippocampal gyrus. Cortex with 
even fewer layers (three), referred to as archicortex, occurs 
in the hippocampus and in the pyriform cortex (a major 
division of the olfactory cortex near the junction of the tem- 
poral and frontal lobes). The hippocampal cortex is folded 
into the medial aspect of the temporal lobe, and therefore is 
visible only in dissected brains or in sections (Figure A13). 
The largest gray matter structures embedded within the 
cerebral hemispheres are the caudate and putamen nuclei 
(together referred to as striatum) as well as the globus 
Cingulate gyrus

_ With one notable exception, studies of 
the sensory and motor systems in Units 
II and II have all included descriptions 
of important connections between the 
_ thalamus and some circumscribed divi- 
_ sion of the cerebral cortex. Here, we 
_ draw together these descriptions into a 
_ brief consideration of the thalamus and 
its anatomical relations to the cerebral 
' cortex. 
The thalamus is a large mass of gray 
_ matter in the dorsal aspect of the dien- 
_ cephalon, superior to the hypothalamus 
(the hypothalamus is described in Box 
21A) and medial to the massive collec- 
tions of fibers that form the genu and 
_ posterior limb of the internal capsule. 
_ Conventionally, the thalamus comprises 
three main parts: the epithalamus, a 
_ small strip of tissue on the dorsal-medial 
aspect of the thalamus to which the 
pineal gland is attached; the subthalamus, 
a region just above and slightly pos- 
terior to the hypothalamus containing 
nuclei that modulate basal ganglia out- 
put (including the subthalamic nucleus 
_ 
discussed in Chapter 18); and the dorsal 
thalamus, which is the largest and most 
complex of the three parts. The dorsal 
thalamus is the part that is now sim- 
ply called the "thalamus" (Greek for 
Anterior 
nuclear 
group 
"inner chamber" or "marriage bed," a 
Galenic reference to its central position 
in the brain and possibly also a sexual 
reference implying the regeneration or 
procreation of sensory signals). It is this 
part of the dorsal diencephalon that is 
most closely associated anatomically 
and functionally with the circuitry of the 
cerebral cortex. 
The mammalian thalamus is a com- 
plex (in the sense that the amygdala 
is a complex; see Box 29B) comprising 
some 50 or so nuclear subdivisions that 
maintain distinct connections of inputs 
and outputs (Figure A). Despite its 
complexity, it is possible to understand 
this structure in broad terms based on 
the locations of its subdivisions and the 
patterns of their projections to the cere- 
bral cortex. Broadly speaking, the thala- 
mus is divided into medial, lateral, and 
anterior sectors by a Y-shaped band of 
white matter called the internal medul- 
lary lamina. Thus, there are groups of 
medial nuclei, lateral nuclei, and ante- 
rior nuclei; there are nuclei embedded 
in the internal medullary lamina itself; 
and there are nuclei along the midline 
of the thalamus. There is also a thin, 
shell-shaped nucleus that envelops the 
thalamus laterally, called the reticular

Ventral posterior lateral 
nucleus (not to be confused with the 
brainstem reticular formation), that has 
a profound influence over the firing 
patterns of thalamocortical projection 
neurons (see Figure 28.13). 
The thalamus is usually considered a 
major relay station for sending sensory 
and motor signals to specific areas of the 
cerebral cortex (with the exception of 
the olfactory cortex, which receives sen- 
sory signals directly from the olfactory 
bulb). These sensory and motor signals 
arise mainly from nuclei in the lateral 
group. The thalamus also conveys less 
well understood but nonetheless specific 
signals to associational areas of the cere- 
bral cortex; these arise from medial and 
anterior nuclei and from certain nuclei in 
the posterior pole of the thalamus. Thus, 
every area of the cerebral cortex receives 
incoming signals that are topographically 
organized from some particular subdivi- 
sion of the thalamus. Indeed, the degree 
to which the functional—and even the 
anatomical—identify of cortical areas is 
determined by specific connections with 
thalamic nuclei remains an active area of 
research and debate in developmental 
neuroscience. 
These so-called specific thalamic 
projections are targeted to the middle

layers of the cerebral cortex, where 
they serve to drive or sharply modulate 
activity in local columnar circuits of 
cortical neurons (Figure B). Examples 
include thalamocortical projections 
from the "somatic sensory thalamus" 
(ventral posterior lateral and ventral 
posterior medial nuclei to the post- 
central gyrus; see Chapters 9 and 10), 
the "visual thalamus" (lateral genicu- 
late nucleus projections to the lingual 
and cuneus gyri; see Chapter 12), the 
"auditory thalamus" (medial geniculate 
nucleus projections to superior, trans- 
verse temporal gyri; see Chapter 13), or 
the "motor thalamus" (ventral anterior 
and ventral lateral nuclei projections to 
the precentral gyrus; see Chapters 18 
and 19). However, there are prominent 
thalamic nuclei—such as the pulvinar 
in the posterior pole of the thalamus— 
that are themselves driven primarily by 
inputs from layer 5 of the cerebral cor- 
tex rather than by lower-order sensory

or motor centers. Such thalamic nuclei, 
in turn, provide higher order input that 
drives activity in other (non-primary) 
cortical areas (see Figure B). Thus, the 
thalamus may serve as both a relay of 
first-order sensory and motor input sig- 
nals to relevant primary cortical areas, 
and a distributer of higher order output 
signals from one cortical area to anoth- 
er. Evidently, it is the timely activation 
of such thalamocortical and cortico- 
thalamocortical projections that trigger 
sensory processing and the execution of 
behavioral programs that move body, 
mind, and emotion. 
In contrast to these "specific" thala- 
mocortical relations, there are much 
more diffuse projections arising from 
intralaminar and midline nuclei that 
terminate diffusely in the upper lay- 
ers of the cerebral cortex. Rather than 
conveying specific sensory or motor 
signals, these so-called "nonspecific" 
thalamic projections have widespread 
modulatory influences over vast net- 
works of cortical neurons, the sort of 
influence that could mediate attention, 
mood change, behavioral arousal, and 
(B) Thalamocortical relations. Some specific 
thalamic nuclei are "first-order" relays of 
sensory or motor signals to the middle lay- 
ers of primary cortex; other, "higher order" 
nuclei distribute output signals via cortico- 
thalamocortical circuits (solid arrows). The 
thalamus also receives and distributes 
modulatory signals (dashed lines). (After 
Sherman and Guillery, 2011.) 
transitions in sleep and wakefulness. 
Unfortunately, it also these nonspecific 
projections of the thalamus that syn- 
chronize paroxysmal activity in general- 
ized seizures, accounting for the nearly 
simultaneous and rhythmical discharge 
of cortical neurons across the cerebral 
hemispheres (see Box 8C). 
Finally, thalamocortical projections 
are reciprocated by massive systems 
of inputs from layer 6 of the cerebral 
cortex that appear morphologically 
and physiologically to serve as feed- 
back modulators of the very thalamic 
neurons that provide driving signals to 
cortical networks (descending dashed 
arrows in Figure B). In fact, for cer- 
tain thalamic nuclei such as the lateral 
geniculate nucleus, the number of pre- 
sumptive modulatory inputs derived 
from the cerebral cortex is severalfold 
larger than the number of synaptic 
connections received from lower-order 
processing centers (the retina, in the 
case of the lateral geniculate nucleus). 
Despite their preeminence, the precise 
role of this feedback modulation in tha- 
lamic function remains poorly under- 
stood. Clearly, there remains much to 
be discovered concerning the neural 
computations hosted by this "inner 
chamber."

pallidus (Figure A14). Collectively these several structures 
are referred to as the basal ganglia (the term ganglia does 
not usually refer to nuclei in the brain; the usage here is an 
exception). The basal ganglia are visible in horizontal sec- 
tions through the mid-dorsal to mid-ventral portion of the 
forebrain, in frontal sections from just rostral to the uncus 
to the level of the posterior diencephalon, and in parame- 
dian sagittal sections. The neurons of these large nuclei 
receive input from the cerebral cortex and participate in 
the organization and guidance of complex motor functions 
(see Chapter 18). In the base of the forebrain, ventral and 
medial to the basal ganglia are several smaller clusters of 
nerve cells known as the septal or basal forebrain nuclei. 
These nuclei are of particular interest because they modu- 
late neural activity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus 
and they are among the forebrain systems that degenerate

ture visible in sections through the cerebral hemispheres at 
the level of the uncus is the amygdala, a complex of nuclei 
and cortical divisions that lies in front of the hippocampus 
just behind the anterior pole of the temporal lobe. 
In addition to these cortical and nuclear structures, the 
internal anatomy of the forebrain is characterized by a 
number of important axon tracts. As already mentioned, 
cerebral cortex in the two cerebral hemispheres is inter- 
connected by the corpus callosum; in some anterior sec- 
tions, the smaller anterior commissure can also be seen 
(Figure A14A). Axons descending from (and ascending to) 
the cerebral cortex assemble into another large fiber bundle 
tract called the internal capsule (Figure A14A,B). The in- 
ternal capsule lies just lateral to the diencephalon (forming 
a "capsule" around it), and many of its axons arise from or 
terminate in the dorsal thalamus. It is seen most clearly in 
frontal sections through the middle one-third of the ros- 
tral-caudal extent of forebrain, or in horizontal sections 
through the level of the thalamus. Other axons descending

diencephalon to enter the cerebral peduncles of the mid- 
brain. Axons in these corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts 
project to a number of targets in the brainstem and spinal 
cord, respectively (see Chapter 17). Thus, the internal cap- 
sule is the major pathway linking the cerebral cortex to the 
rest of the brain and spinal cord. Strokes or other injury to 
this structure interrupt the flow of ascending and descend- 
ing nerve impulses, often with devastating consequences 
(Box B). Finally, a smaller fiber bundle within each of the 
hemispheres, the fornix, interconnects the hippocampus 
and the hypothalamus and the septal region of the basal 
forebrain.

Blood Supply of the Brain 
and Spinal Cord 
Understanding the blood supply of the brain and spinal 
cord is crucial for neurological diagnoses and the practice 
of medicine, particularly for neurology and neurosurgery. 
Damage to major blood vessels by trauma or stroke results 
in combinations of functional defects that reflect both local 
cell death and the disruption of axons passing through the 
region compromised by the vascular damage. Thus, a firm 
knowledge of the major cerebral blood vessels and the neu- 
roanatomical territories they perfuse facilitates the initial 
diagnoses of a broad range of brain damage and disease. 
BOX B Stroke 
Stroke is the most common neurologi- 
cal cause for hospital admission and 
is the third leading cause of death in 
_ 
the United States (after heart disease 
and cancer). The term stroke refers to 
_ 
the sudden appearance of a limited 
neurological deficit, such as weakness 
or paralysis of a limb, or the sudden 
inability to speak. The onset of the defi- 
cit within seconds, minutes, or hours 
marks the problem as a vascular one. 
Brain function is exquisitely dependent 
on a continuous supply of oxygen, as 
evidenced by the onset of unconscious- 
ness within about 10 seconds of block- 
ing its blood supply (by cardiac arrest, 
for instance). The damage to neurons is 
at first reversible but becomes perma- 
nent if the blood supply is not restored. 
Strokes can be subdivided into three 
| main types: thrombotic, embolic, and 
hemorrhagic. The thrombotic variety is 
caused by a local reduction of blood 
flow arising from an atherosclerotic 
buildup in one of the cerebral blood 
vessels that eventually occludes it. A 
reduction of blood flow also can arise 
when an embolus (an object loose in 
the bloodstream) dislodges from the 
heart (or from an atherosclerotic plaque 
in the carotid or vertebral artery) and 
travels to a cerebral artery (or arteriole), 
_ where it forms a plug and causes an 
embolic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke 
occurs when a cerebral blood vessel 
ruptures, as can occur as a result of 
hypertension, a congenital aneurysm 
(bulging of a vessel), a congenital 
arteriovenous malformation, or a trau- 
matic injury involving the meninges 
and/or the brain itself. The respective 
frequencies of thrombotic, embolic, and 
hemorrhagic strokes are approximately 
50%, 30%, and 20%. 
The diagnosis of stroke relies pri- 
marily on an accurate history and a 
competent neurological examination. 
Indeed, the neurologist C. Miller Fisher, 
a master of bedside diagnosis, remarked 
that medical students and residents 
should learn neurology "stroke by 
stroke." Understanding the portion of 
the brain supplied by each of the major 
arteries (see text) enables an astute 
clinician to identify the occluded blood 
vessel. 
More recently, imaging techniques 
such as CT scans and MRI (see Box 
1B) have greatly facilitated the physi- 
cian's ability to identify and localize 
small hemorrhages and regions of per- 
manently damaged tissue. Moreover, 
Doppler ultrasound, magnetic reso- 
nance angiography, and imaging of 
blood vessels by direct infusion of 
radio-opaque dye can now pinpoint 
atherosclerotic plaques, aneurysms, and 
other vascular abnormalities. 
Several therapeutic approaches to 
strokes are feasible. Dissolving a throm- 
botic plug by tissue plasminogen activa- 
tor (TPA) and other compounds, or by 
breaking through a clot with endovas- 
cular devices, is now standard clinical 
practice for selected stroke victims. 
Recent understanding of some of the 
mechanisms by which ischemia injures 
brain tissue has made pharmacological 
strategies to minimize neuronal injury 
after stroke a potentially effective possi- 
bility (see Box 6C). Hemorrhagic strokes 
are treated neurosurgically by finding 
and stopping the bleeding from the 
defective vessel (when that is techni- 
cally possible). 
Although all of these approaches 
can minimize functional loss, stroke 
remains a serious health risk from 
which there is never full recovering. The 
inability of the mature brain to replace 
large populations of dead or damaged 
neurons, or to repair long axon tracts 
once they have been compromised, 
invariably prevents the complete resto- 
ration of lost functions. Despite these 
seemingly intractable limitations, novel 
strategies for neurorehabilitation con- 
tinue to be investigated and introduced 
into clinical practice, offering a measure 
of hope to those afflicted with stroke 
and the disabilities that accompany 
cerebrospinal injury.

and posterior circulation, with the anterior circulation de- 
rived from the internal carotid arteries and the posterior 
circulation from the vertebral arteries (Figure A15A). Gen- 
erally speaking, the anterior circulation supplies the fore- 
brain (the cerebral hemispheres and diencephalon), while 
the posterior circulation supplies the brainstem, cerebellum, 
and upper portion of the spinal cord. However, the pos- 
terior cerebral artery supplies the posterior forebrain, in- 
cluding some deep structures. Thus, as indicated by listing 
this artery twice in Table A4, the posterior cerebral artery 
contributes to both the anterior and posterior circulations. 
Anterior to the spinal cord and brainstem, the internal 
carotid arteries branch to form two major cerebral arteries, 
the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The right and 
left vertebral arteries come together at the level of the pons 
on the ventral surface of the brainstem to form the midline 
basilar artery. The basilar artery joins the blood supply 
from the internal carotids in an arterial ring at the base of 
the brain (in the vicinity of the hypothalamus and. cere- 
bral peduncles) called the circle of Willis (Figure A17A). 
The posterior cerebral arteries arise at this confluence, as 
do two small bridging arteries, the anterior and posterior 
communicating arteries. In most humans, the posterior 
cerebral artery receives its blood supply from the vertebral/

as the vasocorona connects these two sources of supply and sends branches into the white mat- 
ter around the margin of the spinal cord.

deep vessels that penetrate the ventral surface of the brain 
and supply internal structures. An extensive region of the 
central and lateral cerebral hemispheres is supplied by the 
middle cerebral artery (shaded green in Figure A17B). In- 
cluded in this region are the sensorimotor areas that govern 
the upper extremities and face, and the language areas of 
the left hemisphere (Broca's area and Wernicke's area; see 
Chapter 27). The anterior cerebral artery supplies regions 
in the medial aspect and dorsal and orbital margins of the 
frontal lobe, and the medial aspect and dorsal margin of 
the anterior parietal lobe (yellow area in Figure A17B). In- 
cluded in this extended territory are sensorimotor areas in 
the paracentral lobule that govern the lower extremity, ac- 
cessory motor areas in the cingulate gyrus that govern the 
upper face (see Box 17B), and limbic areas in the medial 
frontal lobe. The posterior cerebral artery supplies regions 
in the posterior parietal lobe, inferior temporal lobe, and 
occipital lobe (lavender in Figure A17B). Included in this 
region are primary and associational (higher order) visual 
areas in each lobe and limbic regions in the posterior cin- 
gulate and parahippocampal gyri. 
As Figure A17 illustrates, an anterior-to-posterior pat- 
tern of deep, penetrating branches arises from the anterior 
circulation. The anterior cerebral artery supplies the anterior 
caudate and putamen and the anterior limb of the internal 
capsule. The middle cerebral artery supplies the body of 
the caudate and most of the putamen, most of the globus 
pallidus, the middle part (or genu) of the internal capsule, 
and the anterior hypothalamus. These deep-penetrating 
branches of the middle cerebral artery are usually called 
the lenticulostriate arteries (see Figure A17D). The an- 
terior choroidal artery, which arises from the internal 
carotid (middle cerebral) just distal to the circle of Willis, 
supplies the amygdala, hippocampus, the anterior part of

(Branches of the posterior cerebral artery also supply the 
midbrain as described below.) Thus, the deep structures of 
the forebrain are divided approximately into four sectors 
progressing from anterior to posterior, and each sector is 
perfused by a different artery. 
Blood from the anterior circulation makes its passage 
through the brain from the arterial vasculature back to the 
heart via the internal jugular veins (see Figure A15B). The 
more superficial veins of the cerebrum drain into the supe- 
rior sagittal sinus along the dorsal midline of the hemi- 
sphere, or the cavernous sinus in the base of the cranium. 
The deeper veins of the brain drain into deeper sinuses that 
eventually drain toward the posterior-inferior margin of the 
superior sagittal sinus. The major venous sinuses inside the 
cranium are formed by a separation of the two layers of 
dura mater, the tough, outer component of the meninges 
that surrounds the brain (see below). The superior sagittal 
sinus and the deeper sinuses drain into the paired trans- 
verse sinuses, which are oriented roughly in the horizon- 
tal plane. The transverse sinuses then turn in the inferior 
direction, curving into a sigmoid shape, and finally exit the 
cranial vault as the internal jugular veins. 
The posterior circulation of the brain supplies the poste- 
rior cerebral cortex, thalamus, and the brainstem. The pat- 
tern of arterial distribution is similar for all the subdivisions 
of the brainstem: midline arteries supply medial structures, 
lateral arteries supply the lateral brainstem, and dorsolateral 
arteries supply dorsolateral brainstem structures and the 
cerebellum (Figure A18; also see Figure A16). Among the

most important dorsolateral arteries (also called long 
circumferential arteries) are the posterior inferior 
cerebellar artery (PICA) and the anterior inferior 
cerebellar artery (AICA), which supply distinct re- 
gions of the medulla and pons. These arteries, as well 
as branches of the basilar artery that penetrate the 
brainstem from its ventral and lateral surfaces—the 
paramedian and short circumferential arteries—are 
especially common sites of occlusion and result in 
specific functional deficits of cranial nerve, somatic sensory, 
and motor function. Most vascular lesions of the brainstem 
are unilateral, since each side of the brainstem is supplied 
by different sets of circumferential vessels. However, this 
may not be the case if the basilar artery itself is blocked, 
since it gives rise to vessels that supply both sides. 
Blood is supplied to the spinal cord by the vertebral 
arteries and the 6-10 medullary arteries that arise from 
segmental branches of the aorta (Figure A19). These med- 
ullary arteries join to form the anterior and posterior spi- 
nal arteries. An anastomotic network of vessels known as 
the vasocorona connects these two sources of supply and 
sends branches into a narrow zone of white matter around 
the margin of the spinal cord. The vasocorona may be suf- 
ficient to supply the most lateral white matter in cases in 
which the anterior spinal artery is occluded. Nevertheless, 
if any of the medullary arteries are obstructed or damaged 
(during abdominal surgery, for example), the blood supply 
to specific parts of the spinal cord may be compromised.

The pattern of resulting neurological damage differs accord- 
ing to whether supply to the posterior or anterior artery is 
interrupted. As might be expected from the arrangement 
of ascending and descending neural pathways in the spinal 
cord described above, loss of the posterior supply generally 
leads to loss of sensory functions, whereas loss of the ante- 
rior supply more often causes motor deficits. 
The physiological demands on the brain's blood sup- 
ply are particularly significant because neurons are more 
sensitive to oxygen deprivation than cells with lower rates 
of metabolism. The high metabolic rate of neurons means 
that brain tissue deprived of oxygen and glucose as a result 
of compromised blood supply is likely to sustain transient 
or permanent damage. Even brief loss of blood supply (re- 
ferred to as ischemia) can cause cellular changes that, if not 
e

quickly reversed, can lead to cell death. Sustained loss of 
blood supply leads much more directly to death and de- 
generation of the deprived cells. Strokes—an anachronistic 
term that refers to the death or dysfunction of brain tissue 
due to vascular disease—often follow the occlusion of (or 
hemorrhage from) the brain's arteries (see Box B). Histori- 
cally, studies of the functional consequences of strokes, and 
their relation to vascular territories in the brain and spinal 
cord, provided information about the location of various 
brain functions. The location of the major language func- 
tions in the left hemisphere, for instance, was discovered 
in this way in the latter part of the nineteenth century (see 
Chapter 27). Now, noninvasive functional imaging tech- 
niques based on blood flow have largely supplanted the 
correlation of clinical signs and symptoms with the location 
of tissue damage observed at autopsy (see Box 1B). 
The Blood-Brain Barrier 
In addition to their susceptibility to oxygen deprivation, 
brain cells are at risk from toxins circulating in the blood- 
stream. The brain is specifically protected in this respect, 
however, by the blood-brain barrier. The interface be- 
tween the walls of capillaries and the surrounding tissue 
is important throughout the body, as it keeps vascular and 
extravascular concentrations of ions and molecules at ap- 
propriate levels in these two compartments. In the brain, 
this interface is especially significant—hence its unique and 
alliterative name. The special properties of the blood-brain 
barrier were first observed by the nineteenth-century bac- 
teriologist Paul Ehrlich, who noted that intravenously in- 
jected dyes leaked out of capillaries in most regions of the 
body to stain the surrounding tissues; brain tissue, however, 
remained unstained. Ehrlich wrongly concluded that the 
brain had a low affinity for the dyes. It was his student, Ed- 
win Goldmann, who showed that in fact such dyes do not 
traverse the specialized walls of brain capillaries. 
The restriction of large molecules like Ehrlich's dyes (and 
many smaller molecules) to the vascular space is the result 
of tight junctions between neighboring capillary endothe- 
lial cells in the brain (Figure A20). Such junctions are not 
found in capillaries elsewhere in the body, where the spaces 
between adjacent endothelial cells allow much more ionic 
and molecular traffic. The structure of tight junctions was 
first demonstrated in the 1960s by Tom Reese, Morris Kar- 
novsky, and Milton Brightman. Using electron microscopy 
after the injection of electron-dense intravascular agents 
such as lanthanum salts, they showed that the close ap- 
position of the endothelial cell membranes prevented such 
ions from passing (see Figure A20B). Substances that tra- 
verse the walls of brain capillaries must move through the 
endothelial cell membranes. Accordingly, molecular entry 
into the brain should be determined by an agent's solu- 
bility in lipids, the major constituent of cell membranes.

(A after Goldstein and Betz, 1986; B from Peters et al., 1991.) 
Nevertheless, many ions and molecules not readily soluble 
in lipids do move quite readily from the vascular space into 
brain tissue. A molecule such as glucose, the primary source 
of metabolic energy for neurons and glial cells, is an obvi- 
ous example. This paradox is explained by the presence of 
specific transporters in the endothelial plasma membrane 
for glucose and other critical molecules and ions. 
In addition to tight junctions, astrocytic "end feet" (the 
terminal regions of astrocytic processes) surround the out- 
side of capillary endothelial cells (see Figure A20A). The 
reason for this endothelial-glial allegiance is unclear, but 
may reflect an influence of astrocytes on the formation and 
maintenance of the blood-brain barrier. 
The brain, more than any other organ, must be care- 
fully shielded from abnormal variations in its ionic milieu, 
as well as from the potentially toxic molecules that find

their way into the vascular space by ingestion, infection, 
or other means. The blood-brain barrier is thus crucial for 
protection and homeostasis. It also presents a significant 
problem for the delivery of drugs to the brain. Large (or 
lipid-insoluble) molecules can be introduced to the brain 
only by transiently disrupting the blood-brain barrier with 
hyperosmotic agents such as the sugar mannitol. 
The Meninges 
The cranial cavity is conventionally divided into three re- 
gions called the anterior, middle, and posterior cranial fos- 
sae. Surrounding and supporting the brain within this cavity 
are three protective tissue layers, which also extend down 
the brainstem and the spinal cord. Together these layers are 
called the meninges (Figure A21). The outermost layer of 
the meninges is called the dura mater ("hard mother," re- 
ferring to its thick and tough qualities). The middle layer is 
called the arachnoid mater because of spiderlike processes 
called arachnoid trabeculae, which extend from it toward 
the third layer, the pia mater ("tender mother"), a delicate 
layer of cells that envelopes subarachnoid vessels and ap- 
poses the basement membrane on the outer glial surface of 
the brain. Since the pia closely adheres to the brain as its 
surface curves and folds whereas the arachnoid does not, 
there are places, called cisterns, where the subarachnoid 
space enlarges to form significant collections of cerebro- 
spinal fluid (the fluid that fills the ventricles; see the next 
section). Since the major arteries supplying the brain course

through the subarachnoid space on the surface of the ce- 
rebrum, this space is a frequent site of bleeding following 
trauma. A collection of blood between the meningeal layers 
is referred to as a subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage (or 
hematoma), as distinct from bleeding within the brain itself. 
The Ventricular System 
The cerebral ventricles are a series of interconnected, fluid- 
filled spaces that lie in the core of the forebrain and brain- 
stem (Figures A22 and A23). These spaces are filled with 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produced by a modified vas- 
cular structure called the choroid plexus, which is pres- 
ent in each of the ventricles. Cerebrospinal fluid percolates 
through the ventricular system and flows into the subarach- 
noid space through perforations in the thin covering of the 
fourth ventricle (midline foramen of Magendie and two lat- 
eral foramena of Luschka; see Figure A22); it is eventually 
passed through specialized structures called arachnoid villi 
or granulations along the dorsal midline of the forebrain 
(see Figure A21), and returned to the venous circulation via 
the superior sagittal sinus. 
The presence of ventricular spaces in the various subdivi- 
sions of the brain reflects the fact that the ventricles are the

central nervous system. CSF is eventually passed through 
the arachnoid granulations and returned to the venous 
circulation in the superior sagittal sinus.

of the spinal cord, which normally does not remain 
patent beyond the early postnatal period. 
The normal total volume of CSF in the ventricular 
system and subarachnoid space is approximately 150 
mL. The choroid plexus produces approximately 500 
mL of CSF per day, so that the entire volume pres- 
ent in the system is turned over several times a day. 
Thus, obstruction of CSF flow results in an excess of 
cerebrospinal fluid in the intracranial cavity, a danger- 
ous condition called hydrocephalus (literally, "water 
head") that can lead to enlargement of the ventricles 
and compression of the brain.

adult derivatives of the open space or lumen of the embry- 
onic neural tube (see Chapter 22). Although they have no 
unique function, the ventricular spaces present in sections 
through the brain provide another useful guide to location 
(Figure A24). The largest of these spaces are the lateral 
ventricles (formerly called the first and second ventricles), 
one within each of the cerebral hemispheres. These par- 
ticular ventricles are best seen in frontal sections, where 
their ventral and lateral surfaces are usually defined by the 
basal ganglia, their dorsal surface by the corpus callosum, 
and their medial surface by the septum pellucidum, a 
membranous tissue sheet that forms part of the midline 
sagittal surface of the cerebral hemispheres. The lateral 
ventricles, like several telencephalic structures, possess a 
C shape, the result of the non-uniform growth of the ce- 
rebral hemispheres during embryonic development. CSF 
flows from the lateral ventricles through small openings 
(called the interventricular foramina, or the foramina of 
Monro) into a narrow midline space between the right and 
left diencephalon, the third ventricle. The third ventricle 
is continuous caudally with the cerebral aqueduct (also 
referred to as the aqueduct of Sylvius), which runs though 
the midbrain. At its caudal end, the aqueduct opens into the 
fourth ventricle, a larger space in the dorsal pons and me- 
dulla. The fourth ventricle, covered on its dorsal aspect by 
the cerebellum, narrows caudally to form the central canal

This series of six plates presents labeled images of the human brain and spinal cord. 
The surface features of the brain are shown in photographs of a postmortem speci- 
men after removal of the meninges and superficial blood vessels (Plate 1). Sectional 
views of the forebrain in each of three standard anatomical planes (see Figure A1) 
are derived from T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of a living subject (Plates 
2-4). In these images, compartments filled with aqueous fluids, such as the ventricles, 
appear dark; tissues that are enriched with lipids, such as white matter, appear bright; 
and tissues that are relatively poor in lipid (myelin) and high in water content, such as 
gray matter, appear in intermediate shades of gray. Thus, the appearance of gray mat- 
ter and white matter in the T1-weighted series is similar to what would be observed 
when dissecting a brain specimen obtained postmortem. The final images are trans- 
verse sections obtained from the major subdivisions of the brainstem (Plate 5) and 
spinal cord (Plate 6). Each of these histological images was acquired and processed 
to simulate myelin staining; thus, white matter appears dark, while gray matter and 
poorly myelinated fibers appear light. 
The brain and spinal cord images in these plates are also present in the expanded 
atlases featured in the neuroanatomical media that accompanies this volume, Syl- 
vius: Interactive Atlas and Visual Glossary of the Human Central Nervous System. Sylvius 
provides a unique computer-based learning environment for exploring and under- 
standing the structure of the human central nervous system. The program features 
annotated surface views of the human brain, as well as interactive tools for dissecting 
the central nervous system and viewing annotated cross sections of these specimens. 
Sylvius also incorporates a comprehensive, searchable database of more than 500 
neuroanatomical terms, all concisely defined and visualized in photographs; T1- 
weighted images; and illustrations from this text. For instructions on how to access 
Sylvius, see inside the front cover.
