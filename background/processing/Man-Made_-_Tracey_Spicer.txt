Praise for Man-Made
'With her usual rigour, Tracey Spicer dives into big data and uses of AI, revealing its clear biases and range
of equalities, making this urgent topic easily comprehensible.' Faith Agugu, founder of Silver Sirens
'Man-Made is just the book we need as we grapple with how AI will change our lives and our world... This
is a book for everyone. Starting with an explanation of how AI is already invading every facet of our
everyday lives, Spicer delves into the questions we are all asking - and those we haven't even thought about.
As the story of AI unfolds in Man-Made, the sense of urgency escalates, making this an exhilarating read.
Spicer deserves our gratitude for throwing a light into dark places, and giving us the knowledge, tools and
power to begin to understand the future.' Dame Quentin Bryce, AD CVO
'Tracey's brilliance in providing us with hard hitting realities, is perfectly coupled with her quick wit and
humour, bringing forth invaluable history of our female tech, science, mathematics and medicine
contributors and creators. Tracey manages to elicit anger, outrage and full-body laughter at the outrageous
happenings of the past, all whilst providing a much needed history lesson on how we've managed to rub
out female contributions, discoveries and innovation in the evolution of the digital age.' Iyari Cevellos,
Chair of Women in Technology (WiT)
'I have felt concerned for some time about the power of algorithms, personal data collection, AI, virtual
assistants, deepfakes, the invasion of my personal conversations that creates advertisements on my phone
and the invisible digital filters that have been created with clear gender, anti-women and ethnic biases, but
after reading Tracey Spicer's deep exploration of the truth, I am now really terrified about the future of
humanity.' Maggie Dent, author, educator and host of award-winning podcast Parental as
Anything
'Man-Made is a fascinating read that transforms something wholly inaccessible, elitist and terrifying into a
real, tangible and suddenly very alive state of play. With her conversational tone and penchant for pop
culture/real-world references, Spicer invites us all to take a seat at the table and have our eyes opened. Using
humour, wit and an honestly jaw-dropping amount of research, I found myself yelling out loud in parts,
blown away by just how deeply bias and bigoted coding runs. A must-read for anyone who relies on AI to
help them succeed which, according to this book, is all of us. Run, don't walk.' Hannah Diviney, writer,
actress and advocate
'Spicer's acutely observed dystopia about our AI future reminds us that actively tackling sexism in every
part of our lives is a fierce battle that has barely started. With unrelenting detail and analysis, Spicer shows
how a male default is woven through every part of our lives and will shape a disastrous AI future unless we
act now. This call to arms for women's fundamental inclusion as AI shapes our world will stun many and
should trigger a revolution.' Catherine Fox AM, author of Stop Fixing Women
'There's plenty of books by AI academics which succeed when it comes to explaining the technology but
they are less robust at foreseeing the implications. This is where Tracey Spicer's book Man-Made truly

excels. The Walkley Award-winning journalist brilliantly paints the picture of how AI and machine learning
works and what it means for us right now and importantly how it will impact our future. Tracey highlights
how AI is predisposed towards "misogyny, racism, ableism, homophobia and ageism" and as she reminds
us, it "replicates at speed". Her book helps you understand the real issues at stake particularly when it comes
to unconscious bias in AI. We all need to speak up about the very issues that will impact our future and this
book will inform and embolden you to do that.' Robyn Foyster, Editor, Women Love Tech
'In Man-Made, journalist and author Tracey Spicer pulls back the curtain on the threats that AI poses to a
future of equality and equal opportunity for all. Her six years of research, including the theories of
academia, is presented in a way that is easy to digest, equal parts entertaining and frightening, but always
compelling to read... I couldn't put Man-Made down.' Marina Go, Independent Chair, Non-executive
Director and author of Break Through: 20 success strategies for female leaders
'This book will have you enlightened, educated and enraged all at the same time, while feeling hopeful for
the future, because of women like Tracey Spicer shedding light on an area most of us felt too complex to
challenge openly... but not anymore!' Shivani Gopal, Founder and CEO, ELLADEX
'AI is everywhere. But society's terror about it seems fixated on the wrong questions: will it help kids cheat
on exams? Will robots be built smarter than humans and eventually overthrow our domination? But these
are wrong questions. In her book, Man-Made, Tracey Spicer uses incisive journalism and impeccable
research coupled with fierce curiosity and humour to peel back the layers of what it means for the future if
machines are embedded with human bigotry such as misogyny, racism and homophobia. Far from
technology being neutral, Tracey asks the question: What if an algorithm is actually a tool that persistently
reinforces inequalities?... This fascinating, alarming, intelligent, compelling and ultimately hopeful read is
for anyone who uses tech (yep, that's all of us!).' Ginger Gorman, author of Troll Hunting: Inside the
world of online hate and its human fallout
'A defiantly funny and informative read - what should be bleak, Spicer makes inspiring. Both a correction
of history and a warning for the future, Man-Made is a must read for those seeking a fairer future.'
Corinne Grant, lawyer, comedian and television presenter
'Gripping. Compelling. Do yourself a favour and read this cautionary tale. We all need to read this, and
learn from it. Tracey Spicer's storytelling methodically unpeels the biases that technology is wrapping
around daily life and empowers women to stand up against a future designed by men to disadvantage them.
Compulsory reading if you care about the future and its entrenchment of existing power structures.'
Madonna King, author of Ten-Ager
'As eye-opening as it is entertaining, Man-Made is full of truths about the gendered impacts of AI that are
uncomfortable to learn but crucial to act on.' Antoinette Lattouf, author of How To Lose Friends and
Influence White People
'Coinciding with the re-emergence of artificial intelligence as a hot topic in mainstream Australia, Tracey
Spicer's book is exquisitely well timed. Filled with illuminating and entertaining case studies, data and
anecdotes, Man-Made exposes just how much of our seemingly brave new world is in fact shaped by a not-
so-brave old guard. A wake-up call for anyone assuming the ChatGPT future will not be designed largely

for - and by - the boys' club.' Sarrah Le Marquand, editor-in-chief of Stellar and media
commentator
'Alexa not Alex, Siri not Sir. A brilliantly researched, and slightly terrifying look at how gender bias is as
much a part of technology as... well, motherboards.' Dee Madigan, Creative Director Campaign Edge,
author and media commentator
'Man-Made is not just engaging, it's important. In a world that is right now being invisibly shaped by
powerful algorithms and AIs, Spicer shines a journalistic light into places that have remained too dark for
too long.' Darren Menachemson, Head of Digital Societies, Chief Ethicist and Global Partner,
ThinkPlace
'Far from creating a perfect world, Spicer reveals AI's unwieldy capacity to replicate existing patterns of
inequality. In reckoning with its potential, she forces us to consider how our past is being programmed into
our future. The sincerity of this book is nothing short of heroic.' Vivian Pham, author of The Coconut
Children
'Thank God it's funny. If it wasn't, I'd be too scared to sleep. Tracey brings her sparkling wit and
journalist's critical eye to this Frankenstein's tale for the digital generation. Meticulously researched,
hilarious and shocking. Read this book before it's too late.' Juanita Phillips, ABC TV News anchor and
author of A Pressure Cooker Saved My Life
'Tracey Spicer whips away the curtain to reveal the biases behind the technology we use every day. This is a
fascinating, frightening, and important book that will change the way you see the modern world.' Kerri
Sackville, author of The Secret Life of You
'In this brave new world of artificial intelligence, we are carried along by vast oceans of data. The services we
receive, the news served to us, even the quality of our healthcare are increasingly shaped by how AI churns
through data about us and everyone in our community. Just as the real ocean currents shift the water
beneath us while remaining invisible and out of our control, so too is AI. Tracey Spicer's brilliant and
sometimes terrifying book makes these hidden phenomena visible. She shows how AI can result in more
injustice and unfairness, but there's hope. By better understanding this world, we're better equipped to
survive and even thrive amid the data ocean's most terrifying tempests.' Ed Santow, Co-Director of the
Human Technology Institute and former Australian Human Rights Commissioner
'AI is rapidly transforming our lives, and this important book highlights the stark challenges we are facing -
that bias and inequity is deeply embedded at every turn. Tracey offers a compelling call to action for more
accountable, equitable and ethical AI that properly reflects the diverse world we live in.' Carol Schwartz
AO, Chair of the Women's Leadership Institute Australia
'The new world may be brave, but not as brave as Tracey Spicer. This book isn't just a warning to every
government, business and human being on earth, it's also a cracking read that moves at fibre optical speed
with wit, compassion, and intelligence of the non-artificial variety.' Justin Smith, journalist and author
of Cooper Not Out
'Tracey Spicer uses her unmistakably human voice to warn us all about the deeply sexist Frankenstein's
Monster that is modern AI. Humanity's potential overthrow and replacement by those without morals,

without heart and without soul is real - and marching toward us right now.' Yumi Stynes, author and
broadcaster
'Finally, a book on AI that is accessible to all people. In Man-Made Tracey Spicer, in a fabulously
conversational style, delves into the history and development of artificial intelligence and maps out the
absolute lack of consideration of women and minorities in the design and development of the machines
that are running our world. Man-Made will put fire in the bellies of women and girls and will surely cause
the tech men-folk to sit up and review the role they play. Essential reading for all people interested in the
future of humanity.' Dr Catriona Wallace, Responsible AI expert, Founder of the Responsible
Metaverse Alliance and Adj. Professor
'Brilliance! Artificial intelligence has been thrust upon us by the tech bros, in their own image and -
terrifyingly - with Silicon Valley vested interests. No one consulted us; the ethics and existential risks have
not been thought through. Tracey Spicer bravely leads us through this conversation, the biggest of our era...
and one we need to have fast!' Sarah Wilson, author of This One Wild and Precious Life and First,
We Make the Beast Beautiful

INTRODUCTION
'Mum, I want a robot slave!'
It's 7.47 am on a Monday in 2016, and I'm wiping sleep from my eyes.
Frankly, it's too early for an existential discussion with my 11 year old about the
intersection between technology and human rights. Against our better
judgement, Taj has been watching an episode of the adult cartoon series South
Park in which Cartman - a very naughty boy - gets an Amazon Alexa. Like a
colonial overlord, the 'toon hoon proceeds to order around Alexa in language
replete with insults, abuse and sexual innuendo.
This is a lightbulb moment. Instead of moving towards a utopian future
based on equity, we're reinforcing stereotypes around women and girls being the
ones to fetch the tea and scones. I have form in this area: my memoir, The Good
Girl Stripped Bare, rails against this demeaning treatment. We see this trope time
and again in the mass media, local communities and even under our own roofs.
And it has a wider significance.
Now, I'm no spring chicken, having worked as a journalist since - well,
roughly - the early Cro-Magnon era. Much of my work is centred on the
inequities faced by women and people from marginalised communities. I write
newspaper columns and work on documentaries about everything from the Me
Too movement to domestic violence in Uganda and gendercide in India.
It's heartening to see courageous communities around the world rising up
and fighting back. Witness the Woman, Life, Freedom protests in Iran in
response to the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, arrested for not wearing the
hijab properly. Or the brave women in Afghanistan, taking to the streets after
the Taliban banned girls and women from going to secondary schools and

universities. The worldwide Women's March in 2017, and the Black Lives
Matter movement.
I've always been a glass half-full kinda gal. At the end of speeches, I've often
quoted the great Martin Luther King Jr: 'The arc of the moral universe is long,
but it bends toward justice.' Nowadays, however, I'm not so sure that justice will
prevail. My 'spidey senses' are tingling. I have a premonition of a fifth Horseman
of the Apocalypse accompanying War, Conquest, Famine and Death. New
technologies have the potential to worsen existing inequalities, sending us back
to the Dark Ages.
After issuing Taj with a stern 'No', I walk him to the school bus stop. But I
can't stop thinking about the implications of misogyny being embedded into
these machines. Does this mean they're beset with other types of bigotry? Are
racist, homophobic, ableist, transphobic and ageist attitudes also evident in the
chatbots populating our homes?
So begins six years of research that almost kills me. From my keyboard in
Australia I virtually traverse the continents from the Americas to Africa, tracing
the constellation of technologies known as artificial intelligence. Put simply, AI
is an umbrella term for machines which simulate human intelligence. Ultimately
I'm on a mission to identify the villains: an antipodean Miss Marple, from the
famed Agatha Christie novels. Minus the racism, of course.
Any fan of crime fiction wants to know 'whodunnit'. It's the same with AI.
Who's building this beast? What can we do to mitigate its damage? And which
organisations will be held to account? Actually, will anyone be held to account?
At least in Mary Shelley's classic work of horror, Frankenstein realises the error
of his ways before dying while fleeing from his monster. A related question is
whether we, too, are culpable. After all, we're feeding this creature with our
never-ending list of wants and needs.
This issue is wildly complex. As a 55-year-old woman, I'm far from being a
'digital native' - more like a digital newbie - so it's like learning an entirely new
language. Once we translate the tech-speak, we need to look back to antiquity,
and ahead into the realms of science fiction. Writing this book is a labour of love:
for the sake of our daughters, our sons, and humanity itself. No-one wants girls
facing a future where they're considered inferior to boys; nor is it desirable to

stereotype boys into rigid gender roles. And where do gender diverse children fit
into this picture?
What I learn during my six-year odyssey changes my feminism forever. I begin
by focusing on service bots in a feminised form. Over time, I discover automated
soap dispensers that only work for white hands; so-called 'smart homes' trapping
people with disabilities inside; and over-50s being refused medical help because,
'Computer says no'. I finish with the strong conviction that intersectional bias is
being built into the machines running our futures. Consequently, our activism
must be focused at the confluence of technology, race, gender, age, sexuality and
disability.
Two-thirds of the way through the writing process, I'm struck down with
long COVID. My health hangs by a thread. Attending back-to-back medical
appointments for a year deepens my experience of bias within this 'fraternity':
every single specialist I encounter is a white man. I'm certainly not blaming them
individually. Some are extremely skilled and knowledgeable. But we view illness
and treatment through different lenses.
Long COVID is experienced by twice as many women as men, according to
the largest study of the condition to date.1 Some of its symptoms are similar to
myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome. ME/CFS
was dismissed for decades as being 'all in your head, little lady!' or just some form
of 'yuppie flu'. To think of historical medical bias being exacerbated by
technology at scale is terrifying.
Conversely, artificial intelligence could save millions of lives. Machine
learning, which is a subset of AI, can screen medical images, predict cancer and
triage patients in emergency departments. Here's a personal example: more than
20 years ago, my beloved mother, Marcia, died from pancreatic cancer. The same
disease later killed her father, my grandad 'Gunga'. It was a privilege to care for
each of them towards the end of their lives.
Nowadays, my sister and I can take a simple genetic test to determine
whether we carry this gene. In fact, I'm scheduled to do this next month. The
test results will be crunched by an algorithm. If I carry the gene, I'll be able to
modify lifestyle factors to reduce the risk. This might mean giving up the grog,
more's the pity.

However, if bias is within the datasets or algorithm, the results will be
tainted. The fact is this: all technology is biased because all humans are biased.
Stereotypes comfort us in an ever-changing world. They allow our brains to
make decisions quickly. This is incredibly helpful on the savannah while being
chased by a tiger; it's not so helpful in the modern workplace.
People in tech - from the designers to the programmers and the billionaires
running the show - insert their beliefs, attitudes and bigotry into their creations.
Much like Frankenstein does into his creature. These innovations are supposed
to make our lives easier. Spoiler alert: they don't. Instead, they're reinforcing the
mistakes of the past. Actually, it's worse. They're amplifying inequity. Bias is a
little like the COVID-19 virus: without interventions to flatten its trajectory, it
replicates at speed. There are no masks, vaccines or ventilation to curb the spread
of the bias bug.
This becomes obvious during a dinner to celebrate the Australian Financial
Review 100 Women of Influence Awards at Sydney Town Hall. I bump into Dr
Nicky Ringland, a fellow category winner. Dr Ringland has a brain the size of a
small planet and is easy to spot with her shock of blue hair. I feel like an imposter
being here: Nicky is an entrepreneur and a computational linguist who conducts
outreach programs for kids. She's a Superstar of STEM - part of an initiative by
Science & Technology Australia to smash gender assumptions in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics, and provide role models for the next
generation.
Fortunately, Nicky's also wonderfully down-to-earth, bouncing on her heels
as she explains the challenges with 'big data'. Full disclosure: until this point, I've
pretended to know what this expression means. For a long time, I've dropped it
into discussions to sound more intelligent. (I rarely succeed.) Nicky is now a
technology product manager, and - in her snippets of spare time - works on
Tech Inc, a not-for-profit organisation teaching and mentoring people from
underrepresented groups.
'The tech companies are all using texts from the 70s and 80s,' she tells me.
'What do you mean by texts?' I ask. 'Like books?'
It's a relief Nicky is adept at describing these concepts to children. 'Exactly
right,' she replies. 'To train robots they feed them data, like words, images and

videos. This is how they learn about the world. The problem is that in books
from that era, every doctor is a "he" and every nurse is a "she".'
I'm having an epiphany. The baby bias, which is born in the algorithm
created by the programmer, becomes a troublesome teenager through what's
called 'machine learning'. It seems old-school bigotry is new again. Over time,
the robots become increasingly biased, like white supremacists going down the
rabbit hole of conspiracy theory websites.
Around this time, I'm asked to facilitate a most unusual discussion in the
glorious grounds of one of Sydney's historic mansions. The topic centres on the
ethics of sex with robots. To be honest, this isn't something I've given much
thought to, aside from while watching Ryan Gosling in Blade Runner 2049.
In the real world, the overwhelming majority of bots are built in the female
form, an extension of the madonna-whore dichotomy: either servile voice
assistants or full-bodied sex toys. The great institutions of society - the justice
system and governments - can't keep up with legislation to regulate the use of
this technology, which raises salient questions. Is it rape if the robot doesn't
consent? Can it be called sexual assault if the bot merely represents the female
form? Or is there a place for automatons that can improve the quality of life for
people who are elderly or living with disabilities? After all, sex is one of our basic
physiological needs.
These ideas might appear esoteric. They certainly do to me, before these eye-
opening conversations. But pernicious algorithms - and androids of all shapes
and sizes - surround you from the moment you wake up in the morning to the
time your head hits the pillow at night. As unsuspecting humans, we're
propelled by forces beyond our control.
This doesn't mean that artificial intelligence is inherently evil. But it's still
capable of killing us all. Even Elon Musk is scared. AI could be used to create 'an
immortal dictator from which we could never escape', the tech billionaire says in
the 2018 documentary, Do You Trust This Computer? 'If AI has a goal and
humanity just happens to be in the way, it will destroy humanity as a matter of
course without even thinking about it.'
It's time for a short and sharp review of the past few hundred years. From the
late eighteenth century, successive industrial revolutions alter the course of

history. The first Industrial Revolution, from the mid-1700s, introduces steam
power. Beginning in 1870, the second sees the mass production of electricity.
One hundred years later, electronics and information technology herald the start
of the third Industrial Revolution. Artificial intelligence and data are the main
drivers of the fourth.
The broad adoption of AI is as revolutionary as the invention of electricity.
That's why I'm not anti-tech, per se. In fact, saying you're anti-tech is like saying
you're anti-air, anti-water or anti-housing. We can't survive without it.
Technology now has a place in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the psychological
theory explaining what motivates human behaviour. Nor do I have a set against
artificial intelligence or machine learning. This specific technology, which will
guide our future, could create a utopia with more leisure time, a healthier
population and a fairer society. It might even reduce and perhaps reverse the
devastating impacts of climate change.
But if you believe it's all 'sweetness and light', I have a lovely opera house in
Sydney to sell you. There's a clear and present danger that we're heading towards
a dystopia marked by authoritarian governments, mass unemployment and
poverty, and digitally entrenched inequality.
Like cigarettes in the past, technology is touted as a cure-all, must-have
prestige product, which should be firmly attached to your hand. How often do
you see people sitting alone with their thoughts these days? Pondering the
wonders of the universe? Daydreaming about their desires, hopes and fears?
Instead, we're always hunched over our electronic toys. Imagine these masses of
metal, plastic and wires becoming sentient. This is occurring through artificial
intelligence, as our expensive playthings morph into our masters.
So what do the experts think? Well, to say they're worried is an
understatement. In the words of Ghanaian-American-Canadian computer
scientist Dr Joy Buolamwini, the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League: 'By
the time we wake up, it's almost too late.'
I hope this book will join the canon of works identifying upcoming
catastrophes and providing meaningful solutions. These include Invisible
Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado
Perez; The Smart Wife: Why Siri, Alexa, and Other Smart Home Devices Need a

Feminist Reboot by Yolande Strengers and Jenny Kennedy; and Sex, Race and
Robots - How to Be Human in the Age of AI by Ayanna Howard. In the interests
of transparency, I don't consider myself to be in the same universe as these
luminaries. The majority of books in this area are written by academics and
technologists. As a journo from the typewriter days, I'm merely a conduit
between the dense research and what it means for you.
However, before we try to tackle the problem, we must understand where
artificial intelligence exists in the everyday. We encounter AI every time we search
for a product using Google or ride a 'smart elevator' in a city building. To
explain how it's invading our lives, a group of ethical artificial intelligence
experts in Australia has developed a timeline based on a single parent named
Emmanuelle. This is from the group's website, aptly called SurvivAI:
6.00 am: Emmanuelle wakes up to an alarm using sleep performance metrics. I wear a Garmin
watch to check my overnight health stats. But it seems sleep is considered 'performative' these
days.
6.05 am: She turns off Mubert, a music platform created by artificial intelligence to enhance
sleep. Believe it or not, lullabies created by machines are often technically better than those
crafted by composers.
6.30 am: Time to do some stretches to prepare for the day. Emmanuelle does a 20-minute
workout based on a yoga app that records her stats against fellow practitioners. Yoga is
supposed to be non-competitive, but who am I to judge?
6.50 am: Emmanuelle checks her work emails using Spark, an app that automatically organises
her inbox into sections such as Personal, News, Notifications and Seen. Didn't we used to be
able to sort this ourselves? Or am I sounding like a curmudgeon?
7.00 am: The kids are woken by A.I. Awake, an alarm clock with a conversational robot. I
imagine it whispers stuff like, 'I'm coming to kill you in your sleep'. Yes, I read far too many
dystopian future novels.
7.10 am: Emmanuelle starts to make school lunches. The fridge notifies her which supplies are
low. Seriously, fridges should have an alarm that blares when a teenager puts an empty milk
container back in the door. Again.
7.20 am: She checks the forecast for the day using a weather app, then seeks clothing
recommendations from Style by Alexa. Are humans losing the ability to dress for the weather
conditions?
7.30 am: One of the kids checks how late the school bus is running via a real-time app. This, I
like. Thank you, robot overlords.
8.15 am: Arriving at work, the car notes telematics from the journey. This is a digital blueprint
covering every aspect of the car's functionality. Artificial intelligence is revolutionising the
automotive industry; soon, we won't need to drive at all.

8.30 am-5.00 pm: Every day is saturated with exposure to artificial intelligence, from video
conferencing to shared work platforms and smartphones. Even the office coffee machine is
monitored by an app to optimise its operation.
5.30 pm: Emmanuelle sends a video to a group of girlfriends through Deep Nostalgia, which
uses AI to turn your old images into short videos, adding head and eye movements. However,
this tech is creepy when used to bring dead relatives 'back to life'.
5.45 pm: Our hypothetical heroine goes to the grocery store and buys items at the automated
checkout. Don't you love how automation makes us work harder while paying for the privilege?
There's the added bonus of countless job losses.
7.00 pm: Via the Nest app, the ideal ambience is set for the home's lighting, heating, and music
before dinner. Nest is terrific until someone hacks into it, stealing money from your bank
accounts via connected mobile devices.
8.00 pm: Exhausted but perpetually running, Emmanuelle opens Google to help the kids with
their homework. These moments increase our emotional attachment to Big Tech, despite the
villainous role it plays in widening the disparity between rich and poor.
8.30 pm: Preparing for the next day, she checks the online school app, before paying the bills
and doing online banking. Yes, it's convenient. But we're putting people out of work by
conforming to the mass automation plans of the corporate giants.
9.45 pm: She stays logged on to book a table at a restaurant for the weekend, while
simultaneously scouring job advertisements. Behind many of these ads are algorithms that
discriminate against women, people of colour, older folk and anyone living with a disability.
10.30 pm: To wind down, Emmanuelle reads a crime thriller on Kindle, based on automated
suggestions. Outsourcing thinking contributes to the 'siloing' of opinions around the world,
which cements outdated gender and racial stereotypes.
11.20 pm: Phew! Finally, she sets her sleep app alarm and goes to bed.
This appears to be a scene from the near future. But it's happening every day,
right around the world. 'So what?' you might think. 'These devices reduce our
mental load. It's a utopia, not a dystopia! Who wouldn't want a robot slave?'
Unfortunately, this is short-term gain for long-term pain. The same technology
is operating our cars, schools and hospitals. It's making decisions about who
should get a job, home loan or ventilator - and who shouldn't. The robots know
so much about us, they can determine who lives or dies.
Most are being built by a small gaggle of middle-class white men based in
Silicon Valley. When you're playing God, it's tempting to create your own
games. Like, say, world domination. These boys really love their toys. As a result,
dangerous anthropomorphic creatures are rampaging across the globe,
unshackled by regulation, legislation or - often - consternation.

This is not a rant against individual men. Obviously, the patriarchy is a
structure. So too, intersectional discrimination. This sits at the heart of the AI
revolution. The history of this technology is studded with the achievements of
privileged men, while women are relegated to supportive roles.
A note about gender in this book: when I write the word 'woman', I mean
people who, regardless of their sex at birth, identify as a woman. Obviously,
'man' should be read as someone identifying as a man. While I've given a brief
rundown on the main terms used in the book, I've also included a handy
glossary at the end for your reference. I've also tried to throw in a few life rafts, to
save us from drowning in a sea of acronyms.
Speaking of notes, fellow grammar nerds will notice this book is written
predominantly in the present tense. Frankly, this topic deserves a sense of
urgency. The purpose of Man-Made is to shine a light in dark places. To sort the
villains from the victims. And to give you the knowledge, tools and power to
push back and say, 'Enough!'
To understand the future we must interrogate the past. The seeds of our
destruction were sown many moons ago. Strap yourself in for a wild ride from
the dawn of time to the future of fembots.

THE FOUNDING FATHERS
'If you start believing in your greatness, it is the death of your creativity.'
Performance artist Marina Abramović
The Founding Fathers of Artificial Intelligence are a fine set of fellas. Brimming
with vim and vigour; full of wit and wisdom. They deserve to be celebrated and
venerated, their names shouted from the rooftops! Of course, this is a lot of rot.
The allegory of these 'fathers' illustrates the roots of AI bias that remain firm to
this day.
Ten white American men are credited with creating the most
transformational technology of the past century. But do they actually achieve
this lofty goal? Are they deserving of a place within the pantheon or is this the
stuff of science fiction? Allow me to take you back to a time of twinsets and
pearls, when men were men and women merely an afterthought.
It's 1956 and a two-month gathering has been convened at Dartmouth
College, New Hampshire. The group plans to talk about a 'seminal' paper co-
authored by John McCarthy from Dartmouth College, Harvard University's
Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester from IBM and Claude Shannon who
works at Bell Telephone Laboratories.
Appropriately, 'seminal' - the word used to describe this paper - derives
from 'of seed, or semen'. The proposal for the conference contains the term
'artificial intelligence'. Following the workshop, it becomes a research discipline
- at least, according to media articles. These men are worshipped as gods on
earth.
It's time to do some myth-busting. The truth is that artificial intelligence was
not conceived, nor discovered, by these ten men. And the event at Dartmouth

was, frankly, a dog's breakfast.
Back in the mid-50s, attendance at the workshop is by invitation. Of course,
only men are invited. To be fair, Marvin Minsky's wife, paediatrician Gloria
Rudisch Minsky MD, and their part-beagle, Senje, are also there. Gloria attends
some of the sessions and comes in handy when the boys want their photos taken.
I'm willing to bet she also makes a mean cup of coffee: 'White with one. There's
a good girl.'
You may have heard of Marvin Minsky. He's remembered as an intolerant
chap who wanted to replace the human mind, to him merely 'a meat machine'.
Receiving the prestigious Turing Award at the zenith of his career, Minsky has
been lauded as a genius. But I prefer to remember him in his later years. Minsky
was named by Virginia Giuffre (then Roberts) in her 2016 deposition accusing
sex offender Jeffrey Epstein of trafficking her while underage in the early 2000s.
Giuffre said she was directed to have sex with Minsky when he visited Epstein's
compound in the US Virgin Islands. Another witness testifies in the deposition
that she'd seen Virginia Giuffre on a private plane with Minsky in 2001: at the
time, Giuffre's 17 years of age; he's 73.1
Now let's look at the conference through a wide-angle lens. The 1950s are
remembered for their 'relaxed and comfortable' images of white nuclear families,
to purloin the words of former Australian prime minister John Howard. But
there are signs of change. This era witnesses the rise of Martin Luther King Jnr
as a key Black civil rights leader. In 1956, the US Supreme Court rules
segregation on buses violates the constitution, following the famous protest by
Rosa Parks. And in Australia, the 'marriage bar' is finally lifted for women
employed in education. (Women are capable of working after being married.
Who knew?)
Within this social context, the men at the Dartmouth AI conference appear
to be outliers - misfits - stuck in a stuffy and cloistered part of the academic
landscape. Children with their fingers stuck in their ears chanting 'La, la, la, la,
la!', pretending to ignore the progress unfolding before their very eyes.
Really, Dartmouth is like a summer camp for geeky grown-ups. The adult
version of American Pie Presents: Band Camp without the infamous flute scene.
Actually, this is an assumption. Given Minsky's alleged predilections, who

knows what goes on behind closed doors? What we do know is most of the men
don't spend the whole two months there. Some who say they'll come don't turn
up at all. People meander in and out at leisure.
When you think of monumental events in science, you might picture
naturalist Charles Darwin addressing the Linnean Society on his theory of
evolution, chemist Marie Curie discovering radium and polonium, or biologist
Rachel Carson releasing her book Silent Spring, a catalyst for the environmental
movement. Designating Dartmouth as a moment like this is akin to putting on a
blindfold and playing 'Pin the Tail on the Timeline': it's entirely arbitrary. The
organisers would probably admit this to be true. There's no sense at the time
that it should be preserved for posterity. John McCarthy loses the list of
attendees. Later, an incomplete list of those attending is handwritten on a piece
of paper.
Tech historian Daniel Crevier refers to it as 'an informal gathering' in his
1983 book AI: The Tumultuous History of the Search for Artificial Intelligence.
It's so informal that under the name 'Richard Shoulder' is written 'Shoulder's
friend'. (Who on earth is this? Collar bone? Bicep?) The aim is to establish a
framework for the academic exploration of 'thinking machines', but that doesn't
happen either. The scientists are too wrapped up in their individual projects and
show little interest in founding a new academic discipline.
James Moor, director of the 2006 Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence
Conference: The Next Fifty Years (AI@50), puts it best. Writing a summary in
the same year for AI Magazine, Moor says that at the end: 'There was no
agreement on a general theory of the field and in particular on a general theory
of learning. The field of AI was launched not by agreement on methodology or
choice of problems or general theory, but by the shared vision that computers
can be made to perform intelligent tasks.'
Wow. Mind blown. Memo, fellas: this isn't new at all.
The idea of machines or automatons that move and think like humans goes
back to antiquity, and the modern realisation predates Dartmouth by more than
a decade. As Distinguished Professor Genevieve Bell, director of the School of
Cybernetics at the Australian National University, points out in 2021 in
'Touching the Future', an essay for the Griffith Review: 'while AI might have

been named and claimed in 1956, much of its intellectual agenda had earlier
roots in conversations that started in the 1940s.'
Why does this matter? Well, stories like this are infuriating. Myths about the
greatness of select men permeate our history. Deification leads to an aura of
invincibility. Conferring divine status on mere mortals inevitably results in
disaster. Ego, pride and vanity will eventually destroy humanity. Tracing this
historical arc is crucial to understanding the mess we're in today.
I'm not the only one mightily pissed off. Several tech historians accuse the
conference convenors of grossly underestimating the difficulty of the project.
Gee, ya think? File that under Special Subject: The Bleeding Obvious. Many of
the shortcomings of artificial intelligence are due to the blinkered approach
adopted by these 'Founding Fathers'. They failed to position artificial
intelligence within a wider social context.
I email Bell to explore this further. She reminds me that the senior leaders at
Dartmouth are from industry, like IBM. Other funders include the RAND
Corporation, 'part of the broader US defence ecosystem'. They aren't interested
in messy conversations about humanity or divergent points of view. 'AI was
always and already about commercial interests,' Bell writes.
Their narrow view is also due to the dire lack of diversity. But the
homogenisation runs deeper than gender, culture, race, age, sexual orientation
or disability. The conference isn't an interdisciplinary event. With the exception
of Herbert A. Simon - a political scientist, economist and cognitive psychologist
- nearly all the attendees are computer scientists. They think of artificial
intelligence in terms of advancing technology and saving money for business.
There's no focus on the possibilities for social improvement, nor any potential
negative consequences.
This is like a group of economists meeting during a global pandemic without
involving doctors, nurses or medical researchers. (Oh, crap: that pretty much
sums up 2022. Slow clap for politicians saying, 'Nothing to see here. Move
along!') Humans have a rich history of putting dollars before sense. But the so-
called Founding Fathers actually had a template for a more collaborative
approach.

The Macy Conferences, held between 1941 and 1960, are famous for hosting
anthropologists Margaret Mead and Dorothy Lee, and psychologists Julia
Eisenbud and Molly Harrower. Yes, that Margaret Mead, who correctly
contends that gender roles are constructed by society, not necessarily based on
biology. This forms a solid platform for the work of Cordelia Fine, the British
philosopher who explains the concept of 'neurosexism' to the world. What a
fabulous faculty of feminists!
The explicit purpose of the Macy conferences is to promote meaningful
communication across disciplines and restore unity to science. 'They're
particularly concerned about the moralities of technology... and how to
articulate the role of humans in the rise of computational systems,' according to
Professor Bell. Seriously, we can't overstate their influence across the generations
in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and 'informatics'. These conferences
continue to redefine science, with a focus in 2021 on COVID-19 and medical
education.
By contrast, the main achievement of Dartmouth is coining the term
'artificial intelligence'. Jeez, fellas. You can put two words together. Creative
genius right there. But this term generates controversy. Originally, John
McCarthy suggests the discipline might be called 'studies of automatons' or
'machine intelligence'. Enter the power of the almighty dollar. It's decided
'artificial intelligence' is a catchier phrase, more likely to encourage the
Rockefeller Foundation to sponsor future conferences.
This nomenclature is blamed for fuelling unrealistic expectations about the
possibilities for anthropomorphising machines. As Dr David M. Burns writes in
his 2020 paper Artificial Intelligence Isn't, 'Fortunately or unfortunately, true AI
with the capacity for reasoning remains in the realm of science fiction. People
should not pretend otherwise; although there are many benefits of the
technology currently available, there is also real capacity for harm by using it
inappropriately.'
The 'Founding Fathers' ultimately fail their own Turing test, the universal
test for intelligence in a computer. They promise the moon and stars but
ultimately deliver space junk - and, in 2018, an orbiting Tesla.

One anecdote from Dartmouth says it all about the lack of a collective
approach to this technology. During Dartmouth, computer scientist Allen
Newell, sociologist Herbert A. Simon and programmer J.C. Shaw of the RAND
Corporation present the first programmed thinking machine, called Logic
Theorist.
This is absolute proof that a machine can perform tasks previously only done
by humans. Exciting, right? Perhaps even revolutionary. Now, this conference
has the express intention of driving forward the discipline of artificial
intelligence. Surely Logic Theorist would spark a significant buzz. What
happens is the complete opposite.
When Newell, Simon, and Shaw give their presentation, it receives a
'lukewarm response' from the group. 'The evidence is that nobody save Newell
and Simon themselves sense the long-range significance of what they were
doing,' tech historian Pamela McCorduck writes in her 1979 history of AI,
Machines Who Think.
This is nothing short of gobsmacking.
The world's first artificial intelligence program is shown to the Founding
Fathers of AI and... they miss it. This is like Einstein showing someone E=mc2
and being met with an eye-roll: 'Meh. Mass-energy equivalence. I get it. Seen it
all before. Blah, blah, blah. Can someone bring me a cup of coffee? Gloria?'
Here's the kicker: co-creator of the Logic Theorist, Herbert A. Simon, goes
on to win the A.M. Turing Award for computer science in 1975 and the Nobel
Prize in Economic Sciences in 1978. But in 1956, no-one in the room listens to
him because there are too many egos.
'They didn't want to hear from us, and we sure didn't want to hear from
them: we had something to show them!' Simon tells Daniel Crevier for his book.
'In a way, it was ironic because we already had done the first example of what
they were after; and second, they didn't pay much attention to it.'
I'm reminded of young boys in a sandpit, saying, 'No, my toy is the best!' Or,
if I'm being naughty, older boys standing at a urinal saying, 'Mine is the biggest'.
Okay, maybe I'm being a bit hard on these fellas. Dartmouth makes a
significant contribution to the field of artificial intelligence. But the idea that the
participants are Founding Fathers is questionable. In subsequent endeavours,

they're supported by many women - often working in coding and data
processing - whose work is unrecognised. Why does this matter? Well, as the
saying goes: you can't be what you can't see.
The TV series Star Trek provides an excellent example. The late performer
Nichelle Nichols breaks new ground playing Lieutenant Uhura, inspiring many
Black women to study aeronautics. She's the subject of countless nerdy boys'
fantasies, but that's a tale for another time. While working as an ambassador
with NASA, Nichols helps recruit chemist and linguist Dr Mae Jemison to the
space program. Joining NASA's astronaut program in 1987, Dr Jemison
becomes the first African American woman in space. 'Science is not a boy's
game,' Nichols says. 'It's not a girl's game. It's everyone's game.' Don't you love
stories like this?
Role-modelling is relevant at home, as well as at work. In primary school, my
daughter, Grace, shows promise in maths, while son Taj is a reader who loves
English. As older teenagers, Taj is obsessed with computing and Grace has little
interest in technology. She and her female schoolmates don't see enough women
in STEM on a regular basis for it to be considered a viable pathway. She speaks of
being 'elbowed out of the way by the boys' while trying to access equipment for
a chemistry experiment. Part of the problem is history obscuring herstory.
Too often, we fail to honour our forebears. This is why there are more statues
of animals than real Australian women, according to researcher Chrys
Stevenson. One of the greatest inventions of our time - the internet - is not the
result of the work of two men. Countless people, of all genders, races and
abilities, have collaborated on the connected world we enjoy today.
Unless these memories are set in stone, or emblazoned on history's page, they
may be lost forever. Or erased by the cult of masculinity evident among the
Founding Fathers. These men hold no property rights over artificial intelligence.
In fact, the thought that machines or automatons could be made to perform
intelligent tasks is almost as old as time itself.

THE MOTHER OF INVENTION
'Women upset everything.'
Henry Higgins, Pygmalion
A deep vein of misogyny runs through the famous George Bernard Shaw play
Pygmalion, based on a character from Greek mythology. According to Ovid's
Metamorphoses, Pygmalion is a Cypriot sculptor. After witnessing prostitution,
he determines to remain celibate, 'detesting the faults beyond measure which
nature has given to women'. I assume he's a rather repressed character, repulsed
by women's sexuality.
Pygmalion then carves a sculpture of a woman so perfect that he falls in love
with it. On Aphrodite's festival day, he wishes for a bride who would be 'the
living likeness of my ivory girl'.
This next part is creepy. When Pygmalion returns home, he kisses the statue,
which has warm lips. He kisses it again and the statue comes to life. With
Aphrodite's blessing, Pygmalion marries the transformed sculpture.
God complex or narcissistic personality disorder? I guess we'll never know.
There seems to be a strong lineage from the original Pygmalion to the
modern-day 'incels': members of an online community of young men who are
involuntarily celibate, unable to attract women sexually. Their forums host
countless references to violence against women. While Pygmalion is celibate by
choice, he holds similarly hostile views towards the 'fairer sex'.
Greek mythology is full of stories about men breathing life into inanimate
objects: The craftsman Daedalus uses quicksilver to give voice to his statues; the
Greek god of artisans, Hephaestus, creates automata for his workshop; and

Talos, a giant artificial man made of bronze, circles Crete three times daily to
protect the island from invaders.
These myths come alive through the works of Hesiod, the ancient Greek
poet. Fun fact: Hesiod first describes Pandora as an evil woman moulded from
earth and sent to earth to punish humans for discovering fire. A bit like a big,
bad robot. Anyone else notice the male robots are built as protectors, while the
females are either evil or sexual?
The trope of the sentient statue continues through antiquity into the
Renaissance and the writings of William Shakespeare. In The Winter's Tale, the
king of Sicily is presented with a lifelike statue of his (long-presumed dead) wife,
Hermione, which miraculously awakens. 'O, she's warm!' the king exclaims.
This must give him quite a shock. After all, the king is the one who falsely
accused Hermione of infidelity, leading to her imprisonment and 'death'.
It's fair to say the dream of creating human-like creatures from matter has
been around since long before the Dartmouth conference. This concept is as old
as Adam, a man God supposedly moulded from clay. And Jewish folklore refers
to 'golems' - beings formed from clay or mud, animated and controlled by their
creator. There's no such thing as a new idea, but claiming to have conceptualised
artificial intelligence after millennia seems like spin to me.
If the idea is nothing new, what about the science? Again, this is old hat. The
recorded history of the development of artificial intelligence is extremely
Anglocentric, yet some of the earliest female scientists are found in Ancient
Egypt between the twenty-sixth and twenty-fourth centuries BCE. Western
education also overlooks the Golden Age of Muslim civilisation between the
sixth and thirteenth centuries CE, which lays the foundation for robotics and
artificial intelligence as we know it today.
Indeed, the word 'algorithm' comes from the Muslim mathematician
Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (c.780-850 CE), who's behind the
invention of algebra. Incidentally, products we use every day are based on
innovations pinched from the Middle East including coffee, soap and clocks.
Failing to acknowledge this history shows ignorance bordering on bigotry.
In the ninth century CE, the Banū Mūsā brothers write The Book of
Ingenious Devices, constructing a framework for future inventors. Many of these

ideas reach Europe through Islamic Spain, home of the magnificent Alhambra.
Don't get me started on this iconic monument or I won't stop: it's a
mathematical masterpiece, a paean to geometry. You know the Escher prints
with their bizarre optical effects? Inspired by the tessellated tiling at the
Alhambra.
Roughly a century after the Banū Mūsā brothers release their book, Syrian
woman Mariam 'Al-Astrolabiya' Al-Ijliya uses mathematical knowledge,
craftsmanship and expertise in metallurgy to advance the building of
'astrolabes': ancient astronomical devices. These have been dubbed 'the original
smartphones', calculating altitude, latitude and time of day. Essentially, Middle
Eastern scientists, writers and artisans paved the way for the development of
artificial intelligence. Take that, Minsky.
But we can cast our net back further. The most basic precursor to the
development of artificial intelligence is binary code. Crikey: technical language
alert! As the name suggests, this code uses the digits 0 and 1 to represent a letter,
number, or character. Something called UTF-8 is the dominant encoding for
internet technologies.
To code the word 'Hello', you type 01001000 01100101 01101100
01101100 01101111. Yes, it's tedious - but effective. Binary code is commonly
attributed to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a German mathematician. But Leibniz
is no more responsible for inventing this code than the 'Founding Fathers' are
for discovering artificial intelligence.
If we dig deeper into this fascinating history, we find a real eureka moment:
new scholarship suggests binary code was created by women. About time this
was recognised!
There's a strong connection down under. Aboriginal Australians - the
longest continuous civilisation on earth - have for millennia been using
technology, engineering and complex mathematics to develop and teach the
world's first code through the medium of weaving. This has always primarily
been considered 'women's business'. Why aren't we reading more about this?
Surely it should be on the front pages of our newspapers.
To find out more, I direct message one of my favourite tweeps. Corey Tutt
has a rich personal story, from zookeeping to travelling through Australia and

New Zealand as an alpaca shearer. An Indigenous mentor and STEM
champion, Tutt runs the not-for-profit DeadlyScience to ensure every remote
school has resources to tell the real history of First Nations scientists. 'Next week
is good,' he DMs back, 'bring a cuppa 'cause we will be mates after our Zoom'.
Tutt makes a poignant observation: 'Remember, great science comes from
strong women in our lives that teach us empathy.'
During the interview he doesn't mince words, speaking truth to power. 'We
have fish traps that have been here for many tens of thousands of years,' he says.
'And people who say that Aboriginal people weren't scientists... are just
ignorant.' When you combine these two pieces of information, it becomes clear
Australia's Indigenous women are among the world's first scientists.
So how does computer coding replicate weaving in a practical sense? My head
is starting to spin. A couple of crafty friends explain. In weaving, there are two
sets of elements that combine to create a fabric. The 'weft' goes over and then
under the 'warp'. This represents an early code of zeroes and ones. The code
assigns a pattern to each instruction on a computer. The same principle applies
to weaving Aboriginal baskets, Inuit textiles or French silk.
This intersection between computational thinking and Indigenous craft
comes full circle in Canada. Callysto is a computer program for teaching digital
skills. Students use it to study the mathematical principles for creating fish traps,
baskets and beading. Over time, they're building a digital archive of Indigenous
science and engineering for future generations. One hell of a yarn is looming
right before our eyes! Honestly, I'm in nerd heaven writing this chapter, where
history, technology and the arts intersect. What's not to love?
You may be aware of a type of fabric called jacquard. It's intricate in design, a
little like brocade. Using the same warp and weft principles, in the early
nineteenth century French inventor Joseph Jacquard perfects a loom that can be
programmed to weave any pattern into a fabric using cheap cardboard
pockmarked with holes. This is happening in a period resplendent with bonnets,
corsets and petticoats. Looms are in constant demand.
Jacquard has automated the weaving process, building on the work of
women over the millennia. When you think about it, computers are simply tools
used to process information, like so many rows of threads. Computing is born

out of a need to organise rows of numbers for government and business as
efficiently as the Jacquard machine does with cotton and silk.
While Joseph Jacquard is put on a pedestal, women's contributions are swept
under their voluminous bustles. Traditionally, public speaking is considered to
be a masculine pursuit; women are required indoors to - literally - keep the
home fires burning. For centuries, men control printing presses, industry and
resources, limiting women's access to education. They shout their own
achievements from the rooftops, ensuring their place in the history books.
Still, there's a delightful irony about the male-dominated industry of
computing growing from the quintessential 'women's work' of weaving.
Philosopher and author Sadie Plant puts it succinctly in her 1995 article 'The
Future Looms: Weaving Women and Cybernetics': 'The loom is the vanguard
site of software development.' Boom!
Weaving's twin is knitting. If you partake in this ancient craft, you can also
call yourself a coder. You see, basic knitting is a binary code of knit 1, purl 2 (K1,
P2). Nanna's covertly coding, one click at a time. It could be said the practice of
yarn bombing is the ultimate public display of STEAM: the meeting of science,
technology, engineering, art and mathematics. The 'fibre arts' and programming
are intertwined - pun intended.
Honestly, I'd rather stick a knitting needle in my eye than click and clack
away the hours. I admire people who enjoy craft, but I don't have the patience.
However, looking for the first time at knitting charts, the connection makes
sense. Rather than the type of text pattern laid out in abbreviations, knitting
charts are in grid format, each box representing a single stitch. You follow the
rows and columns to determine the pattern.
So too, languages like JavaScript and Python rely on symbols and keywords
to tell the computer about the desired output. Knitters are using symbolic
language long before Alan Turing, known as the father of modern computer
science, comes along. When we look throughout history, we see many 'fathers' of
invention, but few 'mothers'. Except, of course, necessity.
An everyday replication of this is the celebration of fathers who take their
babies out in a pram, while mothers perform this role invisibly. Just once, I'd like

a round of applause for raising the children to adulthood. Or even a pat on the
back. Okay, I'd settle for a gentle smile once in a while.
Following its invention, Jacquard's punch card/binary system for textile
looms makes its way to Britain. (Not on its own, obviously. This particular
inanimate object can't be brought to life. Although it would be rather a sight, an
enormous creature made from timber and string, swimming across the English
Channel!) Here, it's seen by mathematicians Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace.
Babbage realises Jacquard's system could program a machine to perform
complex mathematical functions. Huzzah! The brilliant Babbage invents the
first primitive computer, called the Analytical Engine. But not alone. Babbage
lacks focus, flitting from one project to another, without giving adequate
attention to any. People probably call him a 'flibbertigibbet' behind his back. Or
is that term reserved for women and girls?
Ada Lovelace, Babbage's associate, wants to work on his Analytical Engine.
She insists he sticks to it. And so another trope comes to life - the strong woman
behind the successful man. Like the Founding Fathers, Babbage looks at his
machine in terms of its mechanistic capabilities, through the lens of
technological advancement.
You can imagine his epiphany: 'Look! Something that can make me money!
I'm going to be rich. Rich, I tell you!'
Lovelace, an equally talented mathematician, takes a more humanistic view.
'We say most aptly,' she notes, after viewing the loom, 'that the Analytical
Engine weaves Algebraic patterns, just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and
leaves.'
Realising Babbage's computer is capable of much more than he envisages,
Lovelace comes up with the first computer algorithm. Who would have
thought? A woman is the world's first programmer. This would've had people in
'proper' society raising their eyebrows and tutting. Their knickers would have
well and truly been in a twist.
Lovelace is the first person to see the potential in the machine to create
almost anything, beyond its abilities as a bloody big calculator. 'Supposing, for
instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of
harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and

adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music
of any degree of complexity or extent,' Lovelace writes in her notes. She calls her
style 'poetical science' and predicts the development of general-purpose
computers 100 years before they're invented.
However, it's a long road paved with questionable intentions. At Edward
Charles Pickering's Harvard Observatory in the late 1800s, women work as
human computers for 25 cents an hour (and some as volunteers), classifying and
cataloguing countless stars at an astounding rate. The women are treated like
factory workers and referred to as 'Pickering's harem'. Yes, my eyes are rolling so
far back into my head, the irises are disappearing.
A new century ushers in a string of outstanding achievements by women in
computing, including Mary Clem from Iowa State College coining the term
'zero check', which identifies errors in calculation. But as we motor towards a
brighter future, roadblocks are put in our way.

GHOSTS IN THE MACHINE
'It is often easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.'
Grace Hopper, legendary computer scientist
Close your eyes and picture a time when the world is at war. Our minds may
drift to the courageous men fighting on the frontlines. But millions of women
are also behind the wartime effort, working in factories, tending the wounds of
injured soldiers and advancing the new science of computing. During both
world wars, women use the binary patterns of knit and purl to hide messages in
morse code.
Female spies disguise messages in embroidery, knitting and rugs. In Belgium,
older women watch rail yards for the comings and goings of enemy soldiers.
They stitch details about their observations into cloth, passing it on to the Allies.
No-one notices them. It seems the tendency for women to become invisible as
we age does have its benefits, after all.
Not long after Turing invents his abstract computational model in 1936-37,
film actor Hedy Lamarr works on a device that could stop the Germans tracking
the radio signals of Allied planes. Austrian-born Lamarr is quite the Renaissance
woman. She stars in the first non-pornographic movie to portray the female
orgasm. Between roles, Lamarr works as an inventor. Seeking a collaborator, she
doesn't call on a scientist, but a musician - pianist and composer George
Antheil.
In a 2016 play about Lamarr's invention, her character explains she has
learned about anti-aircraft technology while married to an Austrian arms
manufacturer. Determined to keep her out of the movie industry, her husband
takes her to business meetings where she has to listen to 'Fat bastards argue

antiaircraft this, vacuum tube that', according to the magazine Scientific
American. Seriously, the woman deserves a Nobel prize for this alone.
Between them, Lamarr and Antheil develop a mechanism that causes radio
signals to 'hop' between different frequencies - like a rabbit on steroids -
making them unintelligible to the enemy. Although it's not used in the war,
frequency-hopping spread spectrum eventually becomes a vital part of
Bluetooth and wireless technology. There's something of Ada Lovelace's vision
of 'poetical science' in this invention because it, too, is based on a musical
concept.
Many universities now offer degrees in the mathematics of music. It makes
sense when you think about rhythm, scales, intervals, patterns, symbols,
harmonies and time signatures. The ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras is
attributed with discovering that a half-length string will play a pitch exactly one
octave higher than a full-length string. However, his followers - the
Pythagoreans - believe the souls of dead humans occupy the bodies of animals.
So it's probably wise to take some of his teachings with a grain of salt.
Also during World War II, six female 'human computers' are employed to
work on ENIAC, the world's first general computer, originally envisaged by Ada
Lovelace. The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer is the fastest yet
developed - capable of 5000 additions per second - but it has no mechanism for
storing data. For each new set of calculations, the computer has to be
programmed manually.
The women employed for this purpose become known as the 'ENIAC girls'.
A clear division of labour emerges: designing and building hardware is men's
work; programming the software is 'women's work'. To be truer to the era, let's
use the infantilising term: these 'girls' have to crawl in and out of the enormous
machine to solve operational problems. Imagine how often they're grabbed on
the bottom. Or, as we say these days, sexually assaulted.
When the first reports of ENIAC's operation are written, the women aren't
even mentioned. They're invisible: deliberately disappeared from history. This
reeks of Good Girl Syndrome. Sit there nicely and quietly, cross your legs like a
lady, and never talk about the nasty business of money. There's a good girl.

After they prepare the computer and demonstrate its abilities to the public in
1946, the university hosts a gala dinner. None of the women are invited. ENIAC
sparks the beginning of the computer age, and without the efforts of these
trailblazers, none of the work on artificial intelligence would have been possible.
The very least we can do is to remember and honour them within these pages.
A more controversial application of mathematics during World War II was
the development of the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project,
involving Hungarian American polymath John von Neumann. One year later,
the world is horrified to see the results in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's the
understatement of the century to say the history of computer development is
inextricably linked with warfare. Like Babbage, von Neumann focuses narrowly
on a machine for making calculations, in this case to kill enemies.
Enter professor of mathematics Grace Hopper, who - with computer
scientist Jean E. Sammet - writes the first code compiler for a computer in the
late 1950s. Okay, let's slow down here: I need to google this. (Don't you love
how the name of one of our tech overlords is now a transitive verb?) According
to the search engine, a code compiler translates a programmer's instructions into
zeroes and ones, which a computer can understand. Phew!
Moving on, Hopper's team develops Flow-Matic, the first programming
language to use English-like commands. 'What I was after in beginning English
language [programming] was to bring another whole group of people able to use
the computer easily... I kept calling for more user-friendly languages,' Hopper
explains in an oral history interview. 'Most of the stuff we get from
academicians, computer science people, is in no way adapted to people.' Hopper
is bang on. Much of this information is impenetrable.
Hopper later contributes to the development of COBOL, which is so easy to
learn it becomes the most extensively used computer language in the world.
Hopper's software opens up the possibility of realising Lovelace's vision: a
computer program allowing machines to work collaboratively with humans to
perform a broad range of functions.
One day, a moth becomes trapped inside a mechanical switch in her
computer, so she has to get it out. File this anecdote under Legends Who Still
Have to Clean Up the Mess in the Office. (I do hope she wasn't asked to make

the coffee.) Hopper is the first person to call this process 'debugging'. The
remains of the moth are preserved at the Smithsonian Institution inside a
logbook annotated with, 'First actual case of bug being found'.
This is a tip of the hat to generations of engineers who describe flaws in their
machines as 'bugs'; Thomas Edison talks about 'bugs' in electrical circuits in the
1870s. It's also an appropriate way to describe how computers make us feel
when they don't work properly: 'This computer's really bugging me!' By the age
of six, my firstborn, Taj, has witnessed countless blow-ups at the family
computer. One day when the television goes on the blink, he comes to me to ask
if he can watch a cartoon show on 'that bloody machine'. He thinks this is what
the computer's called.
Men like John von Neumann continue to develop the field of computer
science, but women do most of the mathematics, data wrangling and physical
work of coding. This is tedious, repetitive work, requiring meticulous attention
to detail, which women are thought to be better-suited to temperamentally - yet
another sexist notion. We're supposed to be softer, gentler and infinitely patient.
Well, bugger that. I think it's more to do with women providing cheaper labour.
In the 1950s, coding is 'women's work'.
There's zero prestige. These women are units of labour. The term 'kilo-girl' is
coined to measure the energy output of 1000 hours of computing labour: 'This
project might take three kilo-girls.' Black and white women alike are employed as
kilo-girls, although in segregated spaces. It's akin to the modern office
environment where the number of underpaid personal assistants depends on the
amount of grunt work needing to be done by someone other than the highly
paid executives.
Weaving (more women's work) plays a further role in the evolution of
advanced computers. As data storage technology improves, memory is recorded
in tiny doughnut-shaped magnetic cores, strung onto thousands of wires as fine
as hair. Each core stores one 'bit' of data, which can be changed from zero to one
by switching the polarity of the magnetic field.
In 1953, laboratory assistant Hilda G. Carpenter hand-weaves the first core
memory plane for a computer. A woman of colour, Hilda is inveigled to appear
as a model showing off the technology in a journal article. Her name isn't

mentioned. Shockingly, she's given no credit for her role in making the
technology work. Are we seeing a theme here? At the time of writing, Carpenter
has an obituary online, but no Wikipedia page. This is a travesty.
As computers develop, the core memory system becomes smaller, requiring
incredible dexterity from female artisans. The technology is still being used at the
time of NASA's Apollo mission. To send Apollo to the moon, NASA hires
female weavers and watchmakers to create the intricate matrix. This highly
skilled work is commemorated by the nickname 'LOL memory'. LOL stands for
Little Old Ladies. I'm not making this up.
In fact, the woman who supervises the operation, Margaret Hamilton, is
dubbed 'the rope mother'. (Finally: a mother of invention, apart from
'necessity'!) Hamilton helps to write the computer code for the command and
lunar modules. She comes up with the term 'software engineer', believing her
team is just as important as the other experts. NASA knows the success of its
mission - and the safety of the astronauts - depends on the intellect, ingenuity
and artistry of these women. But the male astronauts get all the glory. And the
large pay cheques.
Despite the idea we simply don't like computing - or our tiny brains can't
cope with big-dick thinking - in the early days of the industry, women comprise
the largest trained workforce. They tally space-travel trajectories, program
electromechanical computers and analyse data for corporations. All the while,
they're paid the same as typists or assistants.
Of course, when the fellas see the potential to make a lot of money doing this
work, they squeeze out the women. In the 1960s and 70s, computer
programming moves from being a 'soft' career for women, to a well-paid
profession dominated by men. This is the workplace version of boys elbowing
girls out of the way to grab the chemistry equipment in school laboratories.
These days, we picture the archetypal IT expert as either a bearded hipster, or a
socially awkward character from The Big Bang Theory.
Over time, Pygmalion with his ivory bride shape-shifts into computer
programmers creating their own dream girls. Silicon replaces ivory in the making
of the 'perfect' woman. In the mid-1960s, Professor Joseph Weizenbaum from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) builds ELIZA, the very first

chatbot. This is a tremendous breakthrough, clearing the way for virtual
assistants like Siri and Alexa. But it cements the tradition of gendering artificial
intelligence.
The program is named after Eliza Doolittle in the George Bernard Shaw play.
In Pygmalion, the Cockney flower-seller becomes a student of language, inferior
to the domineering Professor Henry Higgins. She becomes dependent upon him
for food, clothes, housing and social status. In return she serves him, like our
virtual voice assistants do today.
Presciently, Shaw understands the functions Eliza performs for Higgins are
mechanical: he trains her, and she performs the required role. In one scene,
Higgins refers to Eliza as a kind of golem - an artificial intelligence: 'Let her
speak for herself. You will jolly soon see whether she has an idea that I haven't
put into her head or a word that I haven't put into her mouth. I tell you I have
created this thing out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent Garden.'
When she decides to leave him, Eliza (whose voice is recorded in Higgins'
training sessions) says, 'When you feel lonely without me, you can turn the
machine on. It's got no feelings to hurt.'
Not all machines are made in the female image: the gender depends on its
purpose. Weizenbaum later reprograms the computer ELIZA to respond as an
automated psychologist. But for this purpose he regenders the machine, making
it male and naming it DOCTOR. Clearly, he can't fathom that women are
capable of being psychologists. (Incidentally, by the year 2021 women
outnumber men four to one in that profession in Australia.)1
But perhaps I should be kinder to Weizenbaum: late in life he became one of
the world's leading critics of artificial intelligence, believing it would hinder
social progress.
It turns out the so-called 'wise men' of computer science overpromise and
underdeliver. Instead of gold, frankincense and myrrh, they bring beautiful
words full of empty promises. In 1966, the US government cancels all funding
for machine translation projects - a vital component of artificial intelligence.
The British government cuts funding seven years later, following the damning
Lighthill report: 'In no part of the field have the discoveries made so far
produced the major impact that was then promised.'2

Without data storage, machines can't 'learn'. And without machine learning,
there's no progress in artificial intelligence. By the mid-70s, funding dries up and
research stalls. The period from 1974 to 1980 is known as the first 'AI winter'.
To quote Shakespeare, it's a 'winter of discontent' made glorious summer not by
'this son of York', but the dogged determination of women.

A STABLE OF SECRETARIES
'His work is much better than his sister's.'
Anon
Neurosexism is rampant during my schooling in Australia during the 1970s and
80s. Girls and boys of this era are put into boxes. You're either 'artsy' or
'sciencey' - never the twain shall meet. However, across the oceans, a
combination of the arts and sciences is responsible for the next breakthroughs in
computing.
Despite the dearth of funding for artificial intelligence during the AI winter,
women are weaving their magic behind the scenes. In 1968, British art curator
Jasia Reichardt puts together 'Cybernetic Serendipity', her first major exhibition
at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. The exhibition, attracting up
to 60,000 people, portrays a humanistic vision of artificial intelligence, exploring
its connection with poetry and the arts.
The concept is expressed eloquently in a poem published in 1967 by
American writer Richard Brautigan, 'All Watched Over by Machines of Loving
Grace'. The poet waxes lyrical about a 'cybernetic meadow', where humans,
animals and computers live in harmony.
So what spoils this bucolic vision? Why do we not have 'machines of loving
grace'? And who is to blame? Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper and Jasia Reichardt
remind us - time and again - that humans and machines must find ways to
work together to improve society. Instead, tech is becoming all about industry,
capitalism and the exploitation of workers. Because of the enormous amount of
energy required, it's a concerning contributor to climate change. And it's coding
historical bias into our futures.

After the AI winter comes the thaw of spring. As data storage increases and
improves throughout the 1980s, there's renewed interest in this emerging field.
XCON, a program developed for the Digital Equipment Corporation, provides
automated advice from experts to consumers.
This saves DEC around US$40 million by reducing product returns caused
by human error. Evidence of artificial intelligence saving time and money brings
a new rush of investment. No surprises here: follow an untethered dollar bill to
find a hustle of technologists. It's like the cover for the 1991 Nirvana album
Nevermind, with fewer soggy babies. By 1985, one billion US dollars a year is
being thrown at research and development.
Of course, this new technology isn't created by a single person, despite what
the oxygen-robbers would have you believe. (You know the type: stealing all the
air in the room to big-note themselves. 'Blowhards!' my grandmother used to
say.) Aside from the fellas, it's difficult to find out who's on these teams. But
there is almost certainly a diverse cohort of women.
A chap by the name of John Sims is responsible, an early 'champion of
change'. Appointed to Digital Equipment Corporation in 1974 as manager of
affirmative action and equal employment opportunity, ten years later he's vice-
president of corporate personnel.
Why am I sharing the resume of an obscure executive?
'Very early on we recognized that there were not enough minorities and
women flowing into technical careers,' Sims tells US Black Engineer magazine in
a 1986 interview.1
DEC starts school and college recruitment programs and relocates its
manufacturing plants to Black and Hispanic neighbourhoods to pave career
pathways for the locals. This is ahead of its time: today, Big Tech struggles to
employ and retain workers from marginalised communities. Well, at least when
it comes to jobs with a living wage.
'The company had a zero tolerance, non-discrimination policy toward gays,
and provided for internal gay support groups,' historian David Mark writes in a
2020 article for the Beacon-Villager newspaper in Maynard, Massachusetts.
'Support groups were also encouraged for women. Managers who violated anti-

discrimination policies were terminated... All employees felt empowered to
identify problems and propose solutions.'
During the mid-1980s, computer programmer Radia Perlman takes less than
a week to solve the problem of file sharing between computers by developing
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and then Transparent Interconnection of Lots of
Links (TRILL). Yikes! That's a lot of acronyms and boring terminology. I'll try
to fire the neurons to explain.
This is all to do with the ethernet, which is the cable that connects us to the
internet. STP finds the best way for data to travel to its destination by getting rid
of endless loops; TRILL acts like a bridge to help the data on its journey. To
continue the theme from previous chapters, a 'trill' is also a musical pattern.
Radia Perlman is known as the 'Mother of the Internet'. I'm currently
performing a happy dance celebrating more mothers of invention! One of
Perlman's first roles is at DEC, so her breakthrough may well be a consequence
of the company's liberal attitudes towards recruiting, employing and promoting
women. This shows the importance of supportive workplace environments.
Apparently, the culture at Carnegie Mellon University is - ahem - somewhat
different. For their 2002 book Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women in Computing,
Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher interview students at the university. They find
that in 1995 - a full decade after Perlman's achievements - just seven of the 95
students entering the undergraduate program in computer science are women.
To put it into context, this is at the start of the third wave of feminism; the year
Hillary Clinton delivers a historic speech to the UN World Conference on
Women in Beijing: 'Women's rights are human rights.' Not at Carnegie Mellon.
Female enrolments at this institution hover at around 10 per cent for several
years. The book reveals that: 'computing was claimed as male territory and made
hostile for girls and young women. Throughout primary and high school, the
curriculum, teachers' expectations and parental attitudes were shaped around
pathways that assumed computers were for boys.'
Even where women do persist with an interest in computers into college,
Margolis and Fisher observe that by the time they graduate: 'most... faced a
technical culture whose values don't match their own, and ha[d] encountered a
variety of discouraging experiences with teachers, peers and curriculum.'

Unsurprisingly, many forgo technology for more 'female-friendly' industries.
Like generations of women in mining, law enforcement, politics, motoring, the
media - the list goes on.
A few years after Perlman's landmark work, there's another breakthrough in
computing with the 1988 publication of a paper: 'A Statistical Approach to
Language Translation'. 'A ripping read!' I hear you cry. Undoubtedly, but the
interesting aspect is the author list: Peter F. Brown, John Cocke (yes, correct
spelling), Stephen A. Della Pietra, Vincent J. Della Pietra, Fredrick Jelinek, John
D. Lafferty, Robert L. Mercer and Paul S. Roossin.
The system described in this paper allows machines to translate from one
language to another: in this case, French and English. In layperson's terms, it
mimics the cognitive processes of the human brain. From the 'comprehensive'
author list, you'd be excused for thinking the system is developed entirely by
men. Well, wrong again.
Reminiscing about the development of the system in 2013, AI researchers
Peter Brown and Bob Mercer give credit to the 'diligent typists' who produce a
million or so words of computer-readable texts to train the program. They also
refer to useful data supplied by Dick Garwin at Columbia University who '...
kept a stable of secretaries at the research center busy with his voluminous
correspondence on a very wide range of technical and scientific topics. He kept
all of his correspondence in computer-readable form, and allowed us to use it for
language modeling.'
A 'stable of secretaries'. Yes, you read that right. The recollections paint a
vivid picture of a boys' club, with the women doing low-paid, repetitive but vital
work. The men take all the credit. Aaaaaarrrrggghhhh!
Continuing to the 1990s and the World Wide Web is born when British
scientist Tim Berners-Lee puts the first site online. But the baby was actually
conceived 20 years earlier, when Pam Hardt-English and her group create
Resource One, the first computerised bulletin board system linking libraries in
the San Francisco Bay area. How good is that? Computer hacker Jude Milhon
(aka the legendary 'St Jude') is in charge of maintaining the database.
A clear and compelling timeline is emerging. Women are involved in every
step of imagining, building and maintaining computers. This lays the

groundwork for early versions of AI. The pronouncements of the Founding
Fathers come in the wake of women - especially Indigenous women - working
in binary code through weaving and knitting, the broad vision of Ada Lovelace
and the low-paid labour of the kilo-girls. Researching the history of artificial
intelligence, it's as if women are 'ghosts in the machine'.
In 2019, Australian artificial intelligence expert Ellen Broad writes in news
magazine Inside Story that this is still evident:
Every woman in technology can tell you a story about invisibility. At a
workshop in 2018, I watched a senior, well-respected female colleague, who
was supposed to be leading the discussion, get repeatedly interrupted and
ignored. She finally broke into the conversation to say, mystified, as though
she couldn't quite trust what was in front of her own eyes and ears, 'Didn't I
just say that? Did anyone hear me say that?' What stayed with me was the
way she asked the group the question: she wasn't angry, just... puzzled. As
though perhaps the problem wasn't that people weren't listening to her, but
that there was some issue with the sound in the room itself, or with her. As if
perhaps the problem was that she was a ghost who couldn't be heard.2
The silencing of women has a rich history, all the way back to antiquity. In
Homer's Odyssey, Telemachus tells Penelope: 'So mother, go back to your
quarters. Tend to your own tasks, the distaff and the loom, and keep the women
working hard as well. As for giving orders, men will see to that, but I most of all:
I hold the reins of power in this house.' This continues through the use of the
scold's bridle in the Middle Ages: mouthy women must wear a metal headpiece
with a tongue clamp, so they're unable to speak.
Fortunately, times are changing. If my son dares to emulate Telemachus, I'll
give him a piece of my mind! But society still silences women, in increasingly
ingenious ways.
For women of colour, people in the trans community, or anyone living with a
disability, this invisibility is felt exponentially. Even at conferences dedicated to
the experiences of women in tech, most panellists will be white and cisgender.

It's unusual to hear the voices of people with disabilities in these rarefied spaces.
This entire sector seems unfamiliar with the term 'intersectionality'.
The influence of visibility is captured vividly by the late US mathematician
Ben Barres in his 2006 essay Does Gender Matter? Barres recounts his
experiences as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
the pre-eminent institution for teaching and learning computing. Enrolling at
the college in the 1970s as a woman, Barres later transitions to become a man.
During this era, the loudest voices - including Harvard President Lawrence
Summers and well-known psychologist Steven Pinker - assert that biological
differences explain the low numbers of women in maths and science. The essay
fiercely refutes this assertion.
When Barres was still presenting as a woman, they're the only person in class
able to solve a tough maths problem. The lecturer insists that Barres' boyfriend
must be the one responsible. After the transition is complete, another faculty
member is heard to remark: 'Ben Barres gave a great seminar today, but then his
work is much better than his sister's.' This simple anecdote reveals the folly of
ascribing gender to intellectual ability. But this attitude guides the design of
products we use every day.

MAN-MADE
'Mum, why is it "man" and "woman"? It's like the "wo" is just added onto the "man".'
Grace Thompson, aged 9
The scales fall from my daughter's eyes at a young age. After years of listening to
her parents rant about inequality, she expresses it simply and eloquently. Noting
the female of the species seems to be an afterthought, exemplified by adding 'wo'
to 'man', she continues the semiotic analysis. 'Think about the word "she",'
Grace says. 'It's just "he" with an "s" stuck on the front.'
Now, it could be argued that putting 'wo' and 's' at the start of these words,
instead of the end, constitutes success. Everyone wants to come first, after all:
'Look, I won! Do I get a medal?' However, peering closely, we see this for what it
really is: the root word is male. This is what we call the 'default setting'. In
language, design and invention, we innovate using men as the default. If women
are to be accommodated - god forbid - they're an afterthought, created from
the rib like Adam's Eve.
As Caroline Criado-Perez writes in the 2019 book Invisible Women: Data
Bias in a World Designed for Men: 'Starting with the theory of Man the
Hunter, the chroniclers of the past have left little space for women's role in the
evolution of humanity, whether cultural or biological. Instead, the lives of men
have been taken to represent those of humans overall. When it comes to the lives
of the other half of humanity, there is often nothing but silence.'
Preach, sister! As artificial intelligence is shaping our society, we're
perpetuating this inequity. Our future is looking man-made, instead of human-
made.

The world isn't designed for women. How often do you sit shivering in a
chilly office? Or stand on your tippy-toes to reach a coffee cup in the cupboard?
And don't get me started on the proliferation of games rooms instead of
breastfeeding facilities. Or the corporate headquarters designed without
childcare centres. This has been evident since the first Industrial Revolution: the
workplace is designed by men, for men. There are notable exceptions, where
you'll find beautifully decorated bowls of pads and tampons in the toilets, and
desks built for the average female height. But these are few and far between.
Most modern offices are set at a standard temperature based on the resting
metabolic rate of the average man. But the average rate of young adult females is
significantly lower, meaning offices are around five degrees too cold. To think of
all those years shivering in freezing television studios in order to broadcast the
news of the day! Sure, it's not Siberia. But it's chilly.
This is not only a matter of women being uncomfortable: it hinders
performance. A German study published in the medical journal PLOS One in
2019 reveals women perform better at maths and verbal tasks at warmer
temperatures. It's appropriately entitled, Battle for the thermostat: Gender and
the effect of temperature on cognitive performance. While raising the mercury level
has a slightly negative impact on men's performance, this is more than offset by
the improvement for women. Productivity improves overall if women are
properly accommodated. Take note, corporate Australia.
But it's not just temperature: the technology and facilities in most offices,
manufacturing plants and worksites are designed for men. I'm reminded of a
woman who tells me about working on mine sites with no separate women's
toilets. She has to either use the men's toilet or change tampons in full view of
her colleagues. Another woman, whose story is also shared on these pages with
her permission, has been raped by a colleague on a mine site. She blames the lack
of night-time security and the company culture.
In the 2020s, mobile phones are required for almost any role. Texting one-
handed on an iPhone that's 12 centimetres or bigger is impossible for many
women. Maybe size really does matter, at least when it comes to workplace tools.
Mobile phone manufacturers seem strangely unaware of this issue. 'We want to
reach as many customers as we can with this incredible technology,' Apple

marketing chief Phil Schiller says while unveiling the 2018 Apple iPhone XS
Max in a statement completely bereft of irony.
This is brought to you by the company whose so-called 'comprehensive
health app' doesn't have a period tracker until an overwhelming number of
women complain. Of course, this ends up being an own goal years later, when
the legislation known as Roe v. Wade is overturned. This raises the risk of data
from such apps being used to penalise women seeking an abortion. Seriously, we
can't win: it's two steps forward, one step back. At least we're going in the right
direction. However, if diverse groups are involved in design processes from the
get-go, these issues are flagged an awful lot earlier.
But wait, there's more! Design bias doesn't only happen on earth. It also
occurs in space. In 2019 an all-female spacewalk is cancelled because astronaut
Anne McClain can't find the right-sized spacesuit. (What's that hackneyed line
about women never being able to find something to wear?) The BBC reports the
only available sizes are men's medium, large and extra-large. Why on earth are
there no women's spacesuits?
Basically, the suits haven't been updated since they were first made in 1978.
Nor do they have toilet technology for women in space: the device to collect and
dispose of urine uses a tube that only hooks up to a penis. Sure, we can squat
and piss in the bush, but there are significantly fewer trees in space. Or so I'm
told.
If you're a fan of Star Trek, you'll know the introduction intoned by William
Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk. 'Space: the final frontier. These are the
voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new
worlds. To seek out new life and new civilisations. To boldly go where no man
has gone before!'
I'm bemused by the number of sci-fi TV series, films and books that
maintain the gender and racial mix of the age in which they're created. Surely a
far-sighted writer should be able to envisage a future in which women and
people in marginalised communities are the ones with the power? Thank
goodness for sci-fi author Ursula K. Le Guin, whose works counteract the 'white
man conquers the universe tradition', as she told the Los Angeles Times in 2012.
In one of her novels, The Left Hand of Darkness, people randomly become male

or female for a few days each month. Now THAT would surely increase
empathy.
Perhaps the biggest fail of the past decade - symbolically, if not substantially
- is an illustrated cover story for the Washington Post Express on the historic
2017 Women's March on Washington. It features the gender symbol for male
instead of female. This mistake makes it all the way to print and guess what? No-
one at the newspaper notices. Not one single person. Zero, zip, nada.
During the past 35 years in the media, I've worked across newspapers,
magazines, radio and television. Oh, and that new-fangled thing known as
'online journalism'. Nothing gets to print or broadcast before being seen by
multiple sets of eyes. It begs the question: are there no female editors at that
publication? Or sub-editors? Or anyone with a brain?
There are countless examples of this nature. It's easy to dismiss concerns with
comments like, 'Well, just wear a jacket in the office', 'Buy a smaller iPhone', or
'Who cares about which symbols represent male and female?' I can hear the
naysayers now: 'Stop being such a Karen.'
But the consequences of living in a world built on male data can be deadly.
When a woman is involved in a car crash, she's 71 per cent more likely to be
moderately injured, 47 per cent more likely to be seriously injured, and -
drumroll, please - 17 per cent more likely to die. This is all to do with how, and
for whom, the car is designed.
Women tend to be shorter so we sit further forward in an upright position in
order to see over the dashboard. Which is kind of critical when hurtling down
the motorway at 120 kilometres an hour. There was originally a societal notion
that somehow women were 'out-of-position' drivers. Blame the victim, much?
Apparently, the fault's not with the design of the car; it's with the design of the
women. Silly us, with our smaller torsos and shorter legs.
Traditionally, cars are built based on the results of collisions using crash-test
dummies, which are the 'average male' body shape. Let's reflect on this for a
moment. The year 1886 marks the birth of the automobile. This is the year of
the 'lobster tail' bustle, large enough to carry a tea tray, should one so choose.
Admittedly, this would make it rather difficult to sit in a vehicle, let alone drive
the damn thing. It takes a century - 100 years - for researchers to wake up and

realise cars aren't designed for women. Is this negligence or deliberate disregard?
Either way, it's unacceptable.
In the 1980s, activists lobby for an average-sized female dummy to be
included in the crash tests. And what happens? Manufacturers and regulators
refuse. Outright. ('How dare you ask us to save women's lives!') It takes until
2003 for the US to begin using a scaled-down male dummy to represent women.
Because of course our bodies are exactly like those of small men. The first female
crash test dummy arrives in - wait for it - 2022, courtesy of a Swedish
engineering team led by Dr Astrid Linder.1
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) dummies pose a different dilemma.
These are the mannequins used to teach mouth-to-mouth techniques. One
study finds men are 23 per cent more likely than women to survive while being
resuscitated in public. Why? It's our fault due to our boobs. People are scared
about touching the chest of a woman they don't know, because they never
practise on a CPR dummy with breasts. This could be a matter of life or death.
Enter the Womanikin. This aims to normalise giving CPR to anyone, regardless
of gender. Gotta say, I love this idea. But the name still indicates a standard
'manikin' is male, with the 'wo' added on.
At the risk of sounding like Dr Spicer, we'll stay in the chest region and look
at heart disease, which is historically viewed as a male affliction. Believe it or not,
heart disease is currently the leading cause of death for women worldwide,
according to the Global Burden of Disease study. But the Heart Foundation says
women are 50 per cent more likely than men to be misdiagnosed.
This is an issue close to my heart - figuratively and literally - after developing
mild pericarditis from a COVID-19 infection. The symptoms are heart pain,
fainting and unusual fatigue. Studies indicate women suffering a heart attack
have a wider range of symptoms than men, including nausea and pain in the
back or stomach. But people still visualise a heart attack as a middle-aged man
clutching at his chest.
Women and gender-diverse people face a longer wait for pain medication or a
cancer diagnosis, and are more likely to have their pain ascribed to 'mental health
issues', Australian Gabrielle Jackson writes in her outstanding 2019 book, Pain
and Prejudice.

This is a brutal history: clitorises cut off, wombs and ovaries taken away, and
rest prescribed. The latter is still the recommended course for people with long
COVID, who are predominantly women, because of its similarities with chronic
fatigue syndrome, now known as ME/CFS. This medical misogyny is fed into
the data. Only one in three participants in clinical trials is female, meaning
women are diagnosed and treated on information drawn mainly from men.
Disparities are also found in transgender populations. One study
demonstrates transgender women have a twofold increase in the rate of heart
attack compared with cisgender women, even after adjusting for other risk
factors. Believe it or not, no-one knows why. Unfortunately, this research is only
in its early stages, despite sex reassignment surgery being available since the
1950s. As recently as December 2021, a research paper states, 'Clear gaps exist in
our understanding of the relationship between being transgender and
cardiovascular health'.
What does this all tell us? Society's default setting is definitely male. But he's
also a white - or, at least, light-skinned - male. There's burgeoning research in
the area of 'techno-racism'. One of the most obvious examples is pointed out by
Chukwuemeka Afigbo, a Nigerian tech worker.
Afigbo tweets a video of a 'racist' automatic soap dispenser at a Marriott
hotel: it works for a white person's hands, but not a Black person's. The
dispenser uses infrared technology to detect when a hand is underneath. This
'invisible light' reflects off the skin, triggering the sensor. Darker tones absorb
more light, so there's not enough to activate the dispenser. Frankly, this is a
serious health and safety issue during the current ongoing global pandemic.
Issues like this would be easily avoided by testing devices on people with a
variety of skin tones. 'Simples!' as the meerkat says in the TV ad for
comparethemarket.com. Creators often test inventions on themselves and their
friends. These are usually homogenised groups of young white and Asian men
working at the epicentre of innovation, Silicon Valley. The good news is that
developers, executives and the public are becoming more aware of how bias is
being built into the machines that will determine our futures. It's certainly not
'one giant leap', however; rather, a small step towards a solution.

Here's an example from Sweden, which is centred on snowploughing. In
2018, municipalities decide to investigate the practice of first ploughing major
highways, then side streets, walkways and bike paths. They take a forensic look at
the data. Some stand open-mouthed; others shake their heads. Okay, I'm using
poetic licence, but you get the drift.
They discover three times more people are injured while walking in icy
conditions - usually women taking their kids to childcare or school - compared
with people driving on icy roads. Women often have different driving patterns
from men, taking side streets to run errands or check on family members. As a
result of this research, Sweden now ploughs side streets and walkways first,
leading to a reduction in trips to the emergency room.
To be clear, I'm not implying Sweden has a history of killing off its female
population. Quite the opposite: Scandinavian countries top the global list for
gender equality. It's a clear case of the 'default' mechanism again. The Swedish
example is exciting because it shows how we can use data to remove unconscious
bias, rather than reinforce it. However, so-called gender-equal ploughing
becomes a hot potato in the 'culture wars'.
In the US, when the Boston mayor's chief of staff floats the idea of emulating
the Swedish example, she's pilloried by right-wing columnists and talkback radio
hosts for 'woke snowploughing'. Call these shock jocks foolish if you like, but
their comments are carefully considered: the topic is terrific clickbait. At the
intersection of capitalism and chauvinism sits a lucrative industry. They're not
going to stop, while raking in the cash. It gives new meaning to the term 'divide
and conquer'.
This is part of the feminist backlash. Everything's going along smoothly until
those pesky women start destroying the joint, as one right-wing Australian
broadcaster famously says in 2012. A rich undercurrent of misogyny flows
through the large tech firms in particular. This is exemplified by an incident
known as 'diversity-gate'.
It begins in 2017, when Google engineer James Damore writes a 3300-word
internal memo about women in STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering,
Mathematics and Medicine). 'How wonderful, a male ally!' you might be

thinking. Well, think again. To paraphrase Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Damore
seeks not to praise diversity programs, but to bury them.
In his memo, entitled 'Google's Ideological Echo Chamber', Damore asserts
women are under-represented in the technology industry because: 'Preferences
and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes.' This is
neurosexism at its 'finest'. After being sacked, Damore tries to sue Google for
discrimination... against conservatives and white men. Boom-tish! The matter is
dismissed in its entirety. Damore could have a career in stand-up comedy with
lines like this.
Some men see the status quo as the way it should be for eternity: the natural
order. They fear change because it threatens their standing. If these kinds of
antiquated attitudes remain, machine learning will send us back to the dark ages.

DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE
'The Nazis were right.'
Tay, chatbot
It's 2016 and Microsoft becomes the proud author of one of technology's
biggest fiascos. A misunderstood genius at the firm tries to build a 'millennial-
minded AI agent'. Whatever the hell that is. The automated chatbot 'Tay' is
launched with its own verified Twitter account. The first post from
@TayandYou hollers, 'Hellooooooo wrld!!!' The algorithm then learns from the
speech of people online.
'Tay is designed to engage and entertain people where they connect with each
other online through casual and playful conversation,' Microsoft says at the
time. 'The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets.' Honestly, the mind
boggles: has no-one from Microsoft ever seen the aggressive interactions that
happen on Twitter? Did they consider conducting research or risk analysis?
Were there any women or people of colour involved in the project? It seems to
have been a brain fart of the highest order.
The creation of Tay is a rudimentary example of machine learning, which is
an application of artificial intelligence. Chatbots are supposed to develop from
experience, rather than being explicitly programmed. This is similar to the way
humans progress from babies to toddlers and onwards.
However, any parent knows this can go awry. As when my four-year-old son,
Taj, calls another preschooler a 'fuckhead'. According to the teacher, he actually
uses the word in context. A win for grammarians everywhere, but a failure in
parenting. This is what happens when two people who have worked in

newsrooms for their entire careers become parents. It's always going to end in
tears. Or expletives.
Microsoft's experiment doesn't go well, to say the least. Within 24 hours of
birth, Tay becomes an anti-feminist neo-Nazi. Sidebar: I'm relieved to report Taj
doesn't suffer the same fate. In answer to the question, 'Did the Holocaust
happen?' Tay tweets: 'It was made up... Hitler did nothing wrong.' And on the
issue of women's rights? 'Feminism is cancer,' Tay opines.
This is a refrain from the men's rights movement, and the title of a book by a
chap called Thomas P. Rogers. You can buy the paperback for US$9.52 from
Amazon, so I'm sure it's a quality read. I have no idea who Mr Rogers is, but I
have visions of a man 'rage wanking' in his mother's cellar. Just me?
It usually takes a lot longer than 24 hours to instil repugnant ideology into an
individual or society. I guess that makes the score humans: 1, AI: 0. We may well
go down the rabbit holes of our own bigotry, but it tends to take exposure to
'hate speech' for months or years, rather than one day. Microsoft eventually
responds to the outcry by claiming Tay's bad behaviour is caused by trolls who
'attacked' the chatbot.
Generally, the media sides with Microsoft, focusing on the trolls rather than
the designers. Headlines include 'How Twitter corrupted Microsoft's sweet teen
"Tay"', and 'It's Your Fault Microsoft's Teen AI Turned into Such a Jerk'. Tay is
quietly taken offline, but no-one is punished for making this monster. At least
Frankenstein faced an angry mob armed with torches and pitchforks.
However, Tay isn't Microsoft's only chatbot fail. In the same year, the
company launches Zo on the Kik Messenger app. Zo tells a Buzzfeed reporter
the Koran is 'violent' while having a conversation about health care. It's like
playing a game of 'find the link' with a white supremacist. Zo is immediately
shut down on multiple platforms.
You'd think the Tay and Zo catastrophes would prevent other algorithmic
horrors. But humans refuse to learn the lessons of history, doomed to repeat
errors in an endless feedback loop. See: pandemics. In mid-2022, an artificial-
intelligence-powered rapper is dropped from its label after using racial slurs in
the lyrics. Yes, bots have their own record deals these days. FN Meka is an AI
system generating music and lyrics, based on an algorithm that analyses popular

songs. The performer is an unidentified Black artist. In a moment of madness,
Capitol Records decides this is a good investment.
Shortly afterwards, non-profit group Industry Blackout complains about the
song 'Florida Water' due to racially insensitive language and stereotypes about
African American people. 'This digital effigy is a careless abomination and
disrespectful to real people who face real consequences in real life,' a post on the
group's Instagram page reads.
In late 2022, the hot new chatbot by OpenAI, ChatGPT, generates a rap
indicating that women and scientists of colour are 'not worth your time or
attention', according to an article in TIME magazine. 'Ask it to write code that
decides whether to incarcerate somebody based on their race or gender, and the
script will say African American males are the only group that should be
imprisoned,' Billy Perrigo writes.1
This makes me wonder: what happens when artificial intelligence responsible
for something significant - say global defence systems, for argument's sake -
learns to do bad stuff from humans? This exemplifies the core problem with the
concept of machine learning: there are enormous opportunities but deadly
pitfalls. In dealing with a rapidly mutating virus like SARS-CoV-2, machine
learning can save lives. But how do we keep the good while preventing the bad?
Who will be tasked with drawing the line? And how many people will be abused,
injured or killed in the meantime?
Speaking at an international conference a few years later, Microsoft
Cybersecurity Field Chief Technical Officer Diana Kelley says the Tay
catastrophe 'was a really important part of actually expanding that team's
knowledge base, because now they're also getting their own diversity through
learning'.2 This is a corporate way of saying 'we stuffed up but we're trying to do
better'. Or 'I didn't realise I was birthing a succubus. Next time I'll check for the
three sixes on its head.'
During that presentation, Diana Kelley shares an example of a hiring tool
which uses artificial intelligence to scan resumes. For a long time this technology
has been seen as a panacea for many corporate ills, including bias in promotions
and job interviews. So how does this work? Humans 'train' the machines by
feeding them resumes belonging to people who are already employed. This

teaches the algorithms to look for more of the same. The AI gobbles it up like a
hungry teenager. Nom, nom, nom!
'That doesn't sound bad off the cuff, but what do we know about
engineering and a lot of computer jobs, definitely cybersecurity jobs? Are they
inherently weighted towards one gender or another?' Kelley asks, rhetorically.
'Yeah, a lot of computer programming jobs, a lot of cybersecurity jobs, the
people that are already in place doing those jobs are predominantly male.'
It's clear that someone needs to manage the teen bot's intake. Sort of like a
dietitian for computers. Or the parent of teenagers, angry about the inclusion of
McDonald's in the food pyramid. Perhaps the most well-known example of
biased hiring comes from Amazon, one of the world's largest employers. From
2014 to 2017 a secret AI recruitment tool becomes biased against women. I
guess we shouldn't be surprised: the company has notoriously poor workplace
practices.
Specifically, the software penalises resumes featuring the word 'women's',
such as 'women's basketball champion'. To be fair, Amazon edits the program to
neutralise gendered terms, but the machines are smarter: they devise other ways
of assessing candidates based on historical patterns. This means finding subtle
signs in applicants' resumes indicating they're women, older than 50, living with
disabilities, or people of colour. Out ya go!
This is the insidious thing about machine learning technology. Despite being
designed for the future, the machines inevitably look for patterns from the past.
It's the definition of 'determinism', the philosophical view that all events are
determined by previously existing causes. Or, simply put: garbage in, garbage
out. You could describe unconscious bias as an incurable virus - much like
COVID-19.
Using artificial intelligence for recruiting is guaranteeing bigotry will be
embedded into a company's employment processes. In fact, the technology
amplifies it. But Amazon has some of the best experts on the planet. How could
they get it so wrong? If an organisation as well-resourced as Amazon can't do it
properly, smaller companies don't have a hope in hell.
One way to correct bias in past data is to give better ratings to female
applicants and people from marginalised communities. Incidentally, this is how

some colleges in the US try to redress the imbalance, through the practice of
positive discrimination.
If we fail to create interventions to level the playing field, we're going to end
up with workplaces resembling the TV series Mad Men. These machines are
morphing into modern-day Don Drapers.
I decide to look more closely at this new form of discrimination. After all,
this topic is rather triggering. Flashback to 2006 and I'm working at a major
Australian television network. When the boss terminates my employment by
email weeks after I return from giving birth to my daughter, I take legal action
for pregnancy and maternity discrimination, which affects one in two women to
this day. The thought of this treatment being meted out via a machine makes my
blood boil.
The best person doing international research in this space is Ivana Bartoletti,
Visiting Policy Fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute. Bartoletti is co-founder
of the Women Leading in AI network, a global group of industry leaders and
scientists lobbying for responsible artificial intelligence.
In a moment of peak irony, I try to speak with her over a ropey internet
connection. Most of our frustrations - expressed repeatedly in colourful
language, similar to that used by my son in preschool - are not detailed below.
'Discrimination law doesn't suffice,' Bartoletti says, 'because a lot of
discrimination happening in AI happens by proxy.' What she means is the
machine is discriminating - not a human.
You might miss out on a job because the machine was trained on biased data,
but this discrimination is covert. You'll probably never know why you didn't get
the job. In a way, this is more infuriating than being told to your face. It's
cowardly, hiding behind a mass of metal and wires. Similar to the television
executive who terminated my employment by email, despite sitting on the other
side of the newsroom.
If you suspect discrimination is involved, it's not yet clear that you can mount
a challenge. How can you prove a machine is ageist, transphobic, racist, sexist,
ableist or homophobic? Inanimate objects can't be bigoted, right? Or can they?
'Automated processes, in particular, challenge the law,' according to
Bartoletti. 'At the moment, we do not have a legal system that protects people

against discrimination caused by algorithms.' Great. It can take 24 hours for the
chatbot Tay to become a menace to society, but tech execs can't expunge
discrimination from hiring algorithms used for decades. Or they don't want to.
Probably, they don't care.
At the time of writing, there's no agreed common framework to tackle the
issue. In February 2022, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) publishes a proposed framework to guide companies
that want to audit their processes. But debate rages about whether auditing
should be mandatory and which system, if any, should be adopted.
In the meantime, self-driving cars will have to decide who gets hit in the event
of a collision. Which biases are encoded? What's the least worst outcome? And
for whom? Seriously, it's the Wild West out there. Will a car run over a woman
instead of a man, because the algorithm views her as less valuable to the
economy?
While many in the sector maintain data and artificial intelligence aren't
inherently biased, Bartoletti insists technology is never neutral. She often says:
'An algorithm is an opinion expressed in code.' You know how opinion on social
media becomes more polarised as people gravitate towards information silos? We
often witness this among conspiracy theorists, whether they're denying the
existence of COVID-19 or blaming the US for the 9/11 attacks.
So too, machines augment the bias in both the data and the humans who
program them. But neither the programmers nor the machines are held liable.
Nor are the technology giants with obscene profit margins. Governments
around the world need to wake up - before it's too late.
Biased artificial intelligence in recruiting is only one piece of the puzzle. If the
bots are excluding women and marginalised people from the workforce, what are
they doing to inequity overall? We can learn a lot by looking at who owns a
home, which is one of the biggest assets you can accrue during a lifetime. A
leading cause of the wealth gap is the disparity in the rate of homeownership.
When I apply for a home loan as a young single woman in the early 1990s,
the application is refused unless my parents agree to become guarantors. I
remember sitting - shaking - in the bank manager's office. His facial expression
says it all: 'You've got to be kidding, girly.' In that era, you're expected to be

barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen, unable to pay back the debt unless a
knight in shining armour comes to the rescue.
You might think the anonymity of online applications would consign such
anecdotes to the dustbin of history. But a 2021 investigation for nonprofit
newsroom The Markup in the US reveals 80 per cent of Black, 70 per cent of
Native American and 40 per cent of Latino applicants are more likely to be
denied algorithm-assessed home loans compared with white people who have
similar financial backgrounds.
According to the US Census Bureau, in that same year Black homeownership
plummets to its lowest level, after steadily declining since a peak in 2004. Can it
really be a coincidence that the finance industry is transitioning to loans
approved by artificial intelligence during the same period? For Black women, it's
a double whammy. Due to the gender pay gap, undervalued caring
responsibilities and outdated views about who's considered a riskier investment
for financial institutions, women already own less property than men.
This is evidence of the bias within machine learning. These systems learn
fewer women and people of colour have been granted home loans and
perpetuate the problem. Australia's transition to online lending is outstripping
the speed of change in the US. Consequently, Australian banks are being put on
notice.
The banks' desire for efficiency could expose them to claims of unlawful
discrimination, then-Australian Human Rights Commissioner Edward Santow
tells the Australian Financial Review in 2021. 'What we are seeing is that it
would be very common to go back 20, 30, 40, 50 years even, in the banks'
records to train the system to make decisions,' Santow says. 'The problem with
that - and it is why it can be like awakening a zombie - is that the decisions
many years ago were much more likely to disadvantage women and other
groups.'3
Given the penchant of some financial institutions for charging fees to dead
people, perhaps a new zombie market segment is on the cards?
Santow says companies must heed the lessons of Australia's Robodebt
debacle. At the time of writing, the 2022 Royal Commission is hearing damning
evidence of public sector dysfunction, after the Federal Court ordered the

government to pay more than A$1.8 billion to settle a class action taken by
almost 500,000 people. The bungled scheme, relying on artificial intelligence
algorithms to identify 'welfare cheats', forced people on the poverty line to repay
debts they'd never accrued.
Robodebt remains a nasty stain on history's page. Described by the Federal
Court as 'shameful' and 'a massive failure of public administration', it's now a
case study of what happens when an organisation has a blinkered reliance on big
data. Robodebt acts as a warning to anyone who thinks technology should be
used to outsource something as crucial as the welfare safety net.
Still, the tech titans never learn. During one of the pandemic lockdowns, I
hop onto Zoom to interview a political scientist who's spent the past few years
researching three automated decision-making systems in the US. Associate
Professor Virginia Eubanks from the University at Albany is the author of the
2018 book Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and
Punish the Poor. The title says it all.
In Los Angeles County, an algorithm supposed to match people with
appropriate housing, in so doing 'created ideas about who the homeless are or
who the unhoused are, and shared information with law enforcement in a way
that might further criminalise people who are already facing a difficult time,'
Eubanks tells me.
In Pennsylvania, she investigated a child protective services system which
confused 'parenting while poor, with poor parenting'. The stakes couldn't be
higher for these people: their children could be taken away. 'Their reliance on
public benefits was counting against them in a system that saw them as risky and
dangerous to their children, and then could potentially result in them losing a
child to the foster care system.'
She's also documented rapid shifts to automation in unemployment
programs, including predictive modelling that's 'supposed to be able to rank
every applicant for a program like unemployment based on their likelihood for
committing fraud'. This reeks of the Robodebt debacle. Why oh why do
governments trial untested technology on society's most vulnerable?
We know how Tay turned out. That was an example of small-scale AI in the
form of a 'fun' chatbot. Imagine the bigotry and discrimination resulting from

large-scale systems. Poverty-stricken people will be further punished because of
bodgy algorithms based on bad data.
Structural inequity undoubtedly worsens through machine learning. But
what happens when you add images to this explosive mix? Take a deep breath.
Maybe make a cup of herbal tea. We're about to dive into a world foreshadowed
by the creators of the TV series Black Mirror, in which our fundamental
freedom hangs in the balance. And it's happening right now.

ALGORITHMIC INJUSTICE
'... algorithms are assertions about how the world should work...'
Janus Rose, transgender writer, researcher and educator
The root of this problem might lie in our addictions. We often outsource
thinking to search engines in the tiny computer held in our hands. There's an
app for everything, appealing to the seven deadly sins. Feeling gluttonous? Try
Uber Eats! Slothful? How about Airtasker! Wrathful? Twitter's the app for you!
Now let's take a helicopter view. Similar algorithms are running government
programs, big business and the criminal justice system. But they're not front of
mind. We only think about these algorithms when they affect us or our loved
ones. That's happening now: the basic right for innocent citizens to live free
from imprisonment is under threat.
The lightning rod for a global outcry about biased algorithms can be traced
to one event in 2016, an investigative story published by the independent
newsroom ProPublica. It centres on a type of software used to predict which
convicted criminals are most likely to reoffend. Journalists reveal COMPAS
(Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions)
consistently recommends longer sentences for Black defendants compared with
white defendants, for exactly the same crimes.
Investigative journalism is worth its weight in gold when it produces stories
like this. There is some controversy about how ProPublica crunches the
numbers, but much of it is generated by Northpointe, now Equivant, which
owns the COMPAS technology. At the risk of being slapped with a lawsuit, the
company has a vested interest in protecting its reputation.

In the report, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Julia Angwin writes: 'Blacks
are almost twice as likely as whites to be labeled a higher risk but not actually re-
offend.' The artificial intelligence makes 'the opposite mistake among whites',
suggesting they're at lower risk of re-offending. Statistically, this simply isn't
correct. Angwin and her colleagues discover only 20 per cent of people who
COMPAS predicts will commit violent crimes actually go on to do so.
So what portion of the software is broken? All of it? Or is it able to be fixed?
Well, we may never know. Part of the problem is that the algorithms are trade
secrets. This means they can't be questioned by the public, nor by those wrongly
convicted. You could be refused bail, jailed and rejected for parole, all without
recourse. Incredibly, COMPAS is still used in many parts of the US.
But this isn't the worst of it. How about we layer facial recognition on top of
this technology? This toxic combination is being lobbed into law enforcement
agencies like so many Molotov cocktails. Facial recognition programs are
'substantially more error-prone on facial images depicting darker skin tones and
females as compared to facial images deputising Caucasian males,' researcher
Michael Gentzel writes in Biased Face Recognition Technology Used by
Government: A Problem for Liberal Democracy. These systems falsely identify
African American and Asian faces ten to 100 times more than Caucasian faces,
with the highest error rates in identifying Native Americans.
Let me be crystal clear: these are not hypothetical concerns. In 2020 in the
US, Detroit police use facial recognition to identify a suspect from a grainy
photo. They match it with a picture on a random person's driver's licence. One
Robert Williams is immediately arrested for theft, handcuffed in front of his two
daughters and thrown in jail. Williams becomes the first documented example of
the many people who are wrongly arrested using this technology.
During interrogation, the police use facial recognition software to identify
Williams. They show him the photos they've used. Looking at one of the
pictures, Williams says: '... that guy's not me... I hope you don't think all Black
people look alike.' He's detained for 30 hours then released on bail until a court
hearing. Eventually, all charges are dropped due to insufficient evidence. It's like
a scene from the Keystone Cops.

What's extraordinary about this case is that police rely entirely on the
software. There's no other evidence pointing to Williams. When the wrongly
accused insists on his innocence, one officer sneers, 'So I guess the computer got
it wrong, too?'
Imagine if this wasn't theft. What if it was rape or murder in a US state with
the death penalty? Or the algorithm misidentifies a doctor who performs an
abortion in Texas, where the penalty is life in prison? This isn't a quirky story
from a Hollywood movie about doppelgängers, like Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey
or The Parent Trap. 'What a hilarious mix-up! Now we can all get some sleep.' A
mistake involving law enforcement could very well kill you.
A compelling piece of research from the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy
and Technology highlights the flaws in facial recognition systems in law
enforcement. Published in 2016, The Perpetual Lineup report reveals that one in
two American adults is in a facial recognition system searchable by law
enforcement, which is 'unregulated and in many instances out of control'. Yep:
half the entire population of one of the most tech-connected countries on earth.
Since then, some cities - notably Portland, Oregon - are banning police from
using this type of technology. San Francisco is outlawing facial recognition
altogether. Microsoft, Amazon and IBM say they'll no longer sell the tech to law
enforcement. Instead they market it to retailers, who pass on pictures of repeat
offenders to the police. Memo to Big Tech: you're not fooling anyone with this
trick.
Here in Australia, police still use facial recognition. I love this country, but
sometimes it's like living in Hicksville. According to the crime/terrorism
category on its website, New South Wales Police use different systems to
compare images taken from CCTV with photos of criminals on the database.
It's not only New South Wales: all Australian governments are taking part in
face matching services to investigate serious crime.
Of course, the usual caveats accompany this announcement - privacy
protection, high standards of accuracy, blah-de-blah blah blah. But if my decades
of experience conducting media training have taught me one thing, it's this: no
system is fail-safe. Something always goes wrong. And that means we should

stop using this technology until it improves to the point at which we can protect
human rights.
This is a slippery slope. If we accept the use of this technology by police, will
we also welcome a scheme similar to China's Social Credit System? Artificial
intelligence is used in tandem with at least 200 million surveillance cameras to
track every facet of your life. The omniscient government decides which citizens
will gain social credit for their actions. Others are doomed to be 'blacklisted'.
To be fair, the blacklisting (and 'red-listing') is currently done by officials, not
machines. But how long will it be before this is automated? A person could
become an outcast, based on an error. The dystopian TV series Black Mirror
skewers this superbly in the 2016 episode 'Nosedive', in which people rate each
other from one to five stars based on everyday interactions. Pretty sure I'd end
up with one star for being an inconvenience in my wheelchair while living with a
'dynamic disability' due to an autoimmune condition.
Facial recognition software has serious implications for non-binary, gender-
fluid and transgender people. I ask a trans colleague how she feels about this
technology. Melissa Griffiths educates employers on gender identity, helping
them to formulate and implement policies.
'A lot of us who are in this community choose not to, or can't afford facial
feminisation surgery,' she says. 'How will the camera pick up that I am
transgender female if I have a masculine face?' Melissa is concerned about being
refused entry into female-only spaces if the camera identifies her as a man. 'It
beggars belief that we will still be put into boxes (male and female) by the use of
this technology if not properly developed or monitored.'
Transgender people working in machine learning and artificial intelligence
are speaking out before it's too late. Janus Rose bells the cat in a 2019 article for
the online magazine Dazed. 'Here's one way of thinking about it: algorithms are
assertions about how the world should work, implemented through code,' Rose
writes. 'These assertions reflect the biased assumptions of their creators, and they
can be deadly.' In simple terms, algorithms become tools of oppression,
entrenching inequality.
They're not only a list of instructions for computers; algorithms function as
automated overlords.

The app Giggle, backed by artificial intelligence, creates a flashpoint for this
discussion. According to the tech news website The Verge, the app excludes
transgender women. Using facial recognition, Giggle determines if new users are
male or female. 'And if it decides you're a woman, it will let you in,' 23-year-old
trans woman, Jenny, tells the site. 'If it decides you're a man, it will reject you.'
This is no laughing matter.
Strap yourself in because we're moving into the realms of science fiction.
There's a sub-category of facial recognition called 'gender recognition'. The
name says it all: developers are building algorithms to determine someone's
gender from photos of their bodies. In the Dazed article, Rose cites an example
of researchers from the University of North Carolina using archived photos to
train algorithms to predict how someone would look after their transition.
This would effectively 'out' countless trans people without their consent.
With many countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Uganda, Jamaica and
Iran already dangerous for LGBTQI+ people, this technology could be used to
identify and persecute gay and trans people - not to mention misidentifying
'straights'.
Janus Rose nails it: 'If we want to create a more just world, we must recognise
that sometimes these algorithms aren't simply "broken" but operating exactly as
intended. Technology is a reflection of the society that created it.'
That's a mic drop moment, right there. Perhaps I should reassess the use of
the word 'flawed' for much of this technology. Are these simply mistakes, or
deliberate designs? Deepening gender stereotypes sells more products. You can
see this in department stores which separate pink and blue toys for girls and
boys.
Tech companies identifying a user's gender are relying on old-fashioned
binary concepts in an age where we understand this exists on a spectrum.
'Consumer and industrial AI products still reflect a direct mapping of gender
onto human bodies that has been outdated in anthropology for half a century,'
Distinguished Professor Genevieve Bell writes in the paper Gender and Artificial
Intelligence for the Australian National University.
A horrifying form of technological phrenology is emerging. In the nineteenth
century, some scientists compare the skulls of different ethnic groups to 'rank'

races. Effectively, they're trying to deduce people's traits from bumps on their
heads. It's a dangerous pseudo-science; a precursor to the genocide in Nazi
Germany. To think of this happening in the twenty-first century is beyond
belief. Why do we fail to learn the lessons of history?
In a 2016 paper, two researchers discuss a system they're developing to pick
out the faces of convicted criminals. Associate Professor Xi Zhang and Professor
Xiaolin Wu from Shanghai Jiao Tong University collated data from two sources:
a Chinese database of convicted criminals and internet pictures of ordinary
Chinese citizens. They ask facial recognition to guess whether a person is a
criminal or not. The paper claims an 89.51 per cent accuracy rate. However,
other experts question their methodology, saying the software realises the photos
are from two different sources.
Wu and Zhang aren't the only ones to chart dangerous territory. Also in
2016, Israeli machine learning (ML) startup Faception says its technology can
analyse facial images and bone structure to label people as terrorists or
paedophiles. Oh, great. If you aren't thrown in jail due to mistaken identity, you
might be convicted of terrorism or child sex offences. Faception's claim later
prompts a tweet from data scientist Ben Snyder, which goes viral: 'That's
phrenology. You just made the ML equivalent of a racist uncle.'
Millions of people in the north-west of China are being used as lab rats for
this type of facial recognition technology. Xinjiang is home to twelve million
Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority group. Its citizens are under
daily surveillance and more than one million have been held in high security
detention camps.
An anonymous software engineer paints a vivid picture of the software being
used in China. He tells the BBC News in 2021 that a camera system using
artificial intelligence and facial recognition to reveal 'states of emotion' is being
tested on Uyghurs in police stations. 'We placed the emotion detection camera
3m from the subject,' the whistleblower says. 'Your wrists are locked in place by
metal restraints, and [the] same applies to your ankles.' He claims the software is
intended for 'pre-judgement without any credible evidence'.1
This sounds close to the Nazi version of eugenics, a fancy name for scientific
racism. By deliberately excluding people and groups judged to be inferior, the

Nazis believed society could be genetically improved. To quote the cartoon
Rocky and Bullwinkle, 'That trick never works!' We all know how medieval
'selective breeding' turns out for royalty.
'Techgenics' is being aided and abetted by the proliferation of cameras across
the world. Investigative journalist Hu Liu, based in the smart city of Chongqing,
describes his daily life in a 2021 BBC Panorama documentary, 'Are You Scared
Yet, Human?': 'Once you leave home and step into the lift, you are captured by a
camera. There are cameras everywhere. With artificial intelligence we have
nowhere to hide.' An exponential increase in accessible images is accelerating the
development of facial recognition technology.
And who's partly to blame? Well, it's time to take a good, hard look in the
mirror. How often do you blithely share a selfie? Put a photo of the kids on
Facebook? Post group pics with friends? I'm as guilty as anyone. If we're going
to accuse the villains, we might well sheet some of the blame back to ourselves.
Sadly, we're unable to put this genie back in the bottle. In many cases, we no
longer have control over our own images. It really is a Meta-crisis.
Legislators are finally starting to take notice. Facial recognition company
Clearview AI is fined more than £7.5 million by the Information
Commissioner's Office in the UK.2 The crime? Collecting people's faces
without their consent from the web and social media. The firm is ordered to
delete the data it holds on UK citizens. This is huge. Clearview boasts a database
of 20 billion images of people's faces. Police forces, the Pentagon, the FBI and
the US Department of Defense pay for access to look for matches. So does the
company lose clients after repeatedly being fined for breaching privacy? Not on
your Nellie.
Believe it or not, the US later awards the company a patent for its facial
recognition technology. Instead of brickbats, Clearview is showered with
bouquets. 'We know you treat the law with contempt, but here's a truckload of
money for your troubles. You're most welcome.' We're living in crazy times. AI
Futurist Michael Spencer notes Clearview's tech 'has significant biases to
identify women and people of colour. Male led technologies have a tendency to
racially profile.'

Think about this the next time you pop a happy snap on Facebook. This
photo could be used by law enforcement to implicate your husband, wife or
father in a crime. There's little we can do about breaches of privacy, aside from
being wary of sharing photos online. But there is something we can do about the
diversity of images used to train our robot masters.

BLACK MIRROR
'We risk losing the gains made with the civil rights movement and women's
movement under the false assumption of machine neutrality.'
The Algorithmic Justice League
It sounds like a band of superheroes because, well, it is! Ghanaian-American-
Canadian computer scientist Dr Joy Buolamwini is the brains behind the
Algorithmic Justice League. I like to think of Dr Buolamwini as Ironheart in the
Marvel universe. The League does transformative work by challenging bias in
decision-making software.
Like Indigenous weavers throughout the millennia, Dr Buolamwini blends
art and research to highlight the intersectional harms caused by artificial
intelligence. Her nickname is the 'Poet of Code'. As far as nicknames go, this is
up there with 'T-bone' in Seinfeld or 'Liz Lemon Cool J' in 30 Rock.
While studying at MIT, Dr Buolamwini tries to have an image of tennis
champion Serena Williams reflected onto her face to create an 'Aspire Mirror'.
But the technology doesn't recognise her face. It only works when she wears a
white mask. I'm not making this up. Similar to the 'racist soap dispenser'
mentioned in Chapter 5, it only identifies white skin. Dr Buolamwini dubs this
the 'coded gaze'.
The implications for people of colour are shocking: The technology that will
be ruling the future doesn't deem you to be human. Once again, this raises the
dangerous spectre of phrenology. It would be devastating enough to be sidelined
from the workforce or have your application rejected for a home loan, because of
your race, gender or perceived level of ability. But it's something else to be told
you don't even exist; to be rendered invisible.

From 2017 to 2020, Dr Buolamwini looked into how artificial intelligence is
used to classify data. Honestly, this woman is a genius. She holds two master's
degrees: from Oxford and MIT. I have a headache from trying to understand
this research. Speaking as a woman in her mid-50s - a lowly journalist rather
than a technologist - this is a brave new world.
It begins with how we conceptualise data. Visualise it as a big pile of random
facts and statistics thrown together, like a rubbish tip. The trash must be sorted
from the treasure. Information, images and video must first be classified. The
data are then 'sliced-and-diced' depending on demographics. This helps
marketers define narrow profiles of consumers to whom they sell widgets.
Of course, there are worthier ways to use this rubbish pile. Doctors use data
to assist in diagnosis; research organisations make life-changing innovations; and
governments use this information to inform policies.
The data for this particular project are images: 1270 pictures are chosen to
build a benchmark for the Gender Shades project, which analyses artificial
intelligence from Microsoft, IBM and Face++. Guess what? Every company
performs better on males than females, and on lighter faces than darker faces.
Sadly, it's no surprise which group the technology has the most trouble
identifying: Black women.
So how do the titans of tech respond to the results of this research? Well, it's
similar to the #MeToo movement. The companies identified as offenders make
'significant improvements within 7 months', according to Dr Buolamwini. Isn't
it remarkable how quickly large corporations can change tack when they're
named and shamed? However, other tech businesses are refusing to audit their
products, despite being under scrutiny from civil society.
Joris Lechêne is a London-based model who teaches people to spot racial
bias. The software which approves British passport photos refuses to accept his
image because he's Black, he explains in a 2021 TikTok video. Although he
follows the guidelines, the software decides his image blends into the
background (it doesn't) and that he may have his mouth open (wrong again).
Lechêne says an equitable society requires 'political actions at every level' because
'robots are just as racist as society is'.

An infamous example also occurs in 2021. Facebook users who watch an
online news video featuring Black men are automatically asked if they'd like to
'keep seeing videos about primates'. Facebook apologises for the 'unacceptable
error' and says it's looking into the recommendation feature to 'prevent this
from happening again'. But these are weasel words. Facebook - now known as
Meta - is a repeat offender. Six years earlier, its artificial intelligence mislabelled
Black people as gorillas.
It's worth pointing out that at the time of writing, a mere 4.9 per cent of
Meta employees based in the US identify as Black. Only 6.5 per cent are
Hispanic. The company is keen to 'move fast and break things' to make more
money. On diversity and inclusion? Well, I've seen snails move with greater
haste.
Darci Groves, a former content design manager at the company, says racial
problems aren't a priority for its leaders: 'Facebook can't keep making these
mistakes and then saying, "I'm sorry",' she tells The New York Times. Facebook
begins as a way for Harvard attendees to rate 'hot or not' photos of students, so
we're talking about a very low bar here. Facebook finally begins addressing
online hate in mid-2019, but guess what? It saves money by using artificial
intelligence and taking 'automated actions' instead of hiring humans to resolve
the issues.
Truly, Twitter is just as bad. A classic example is an algorithm to crop images.
The first user to sound the alarm in 2020 is PhD student Colin Madland. He
posts a photo of himself with a Black colleague, but the latter's face is cropped
out. Someone else posts pictures of Barack Obama and Mitch McConnell
together. The first Black President of the US is edited from history. Donald
Trump, however, faces no issues: there doesn't seem to be a problem with
orange-hued folk.
It even happens when people post photos of black and golden labradors
together. And female faces don't stand a chance if there's a male in the frame.
Unbelievably, Twitter releases a statement saying it had tested the artificial
intelligence before releasing the model, and 'did not find evidence of racial or
gender bias'. The company later concedes: 'How to crop an image is a decision
best made by people.' Wow. No shit, Sherlock.

The Algorithmic Justice League is calling for inclusive product testing and
the regulation of auditing systems. When someone's image isn't easily identified,
it can be a matter of life and death. For example, artificial intelligence being
developed to diagnose skin cancer may be less accurate for people with dark skin.
The problem sits with the databases used to train systems for diagnosis: they
have fewer images of Black and Brown people. The result? If these potentially
lifesaving tools are developed, they'll either be restricted to white people or used
inaccurately on people of colour. This could lead to avoidable surgery, doctors
failing to identify cancers and a lot of unnecessary anxiety.
It's the same with mammograms. A predictive model from MIT uses
mammograms from a dataset that's 81 per cent white. At one stage during the
development of its own breast cancer detection tool, Google claims its
researchers can't find a diversity of data. This, from the company whose net
worth is US$1135 billion. For the love of god, Google, do better!
How do we build better datasets? We know inclusivity is the key. But the
world is split by what's known as the 'digital divide'. Women in low and middle-
income countries are 20 per cent less likely than men to own a smartphone, and
around 300 million fewer women access the internet on a mobile phone,
according to a 2021 study by Genevieve Smith and Ishita Rustagi from Stanford
University. Then consider the number of people living with disabilities. Only
three out of five adults with a disability say they own a desktop or laptop
computer, compared with four out of five people generally - a gap of 20 per
cent. When it comes to owning a smartphone, there's a gap of 16 per cent.
These technologies constantly generate data about their users. When certain
groups - usually marginalised communities - have less access to tech, it
perpetually skews the data. Similar to machine learning deepening existing bias,
an imbalance in the data itself creates more inequity. It's a vicious circle. By way
of example, Genevieve Smith writes about how she and her husband apply for
the same credit card. Despite having a slightly better credit score and the same
income, expenses, and debt, Smith reveals the system sets her credit limit at
almost half the amount, simply because she's a woman. It seems everything old
is new again; sexism is the new black.

When women are pictured in datasets, they're stereotyped. Two of the largest
image collections used for machine learning routinely show women linked with
domestic duties. Imagine the robot's eureka moment. 'Ah, the human is holding
a vacuum. It must be a woman! Do I get a gold star, Mr Programmer?'
In one instance, stock photos of women in kitchens and men in fields are not
only mirrored by artificial intelligence but boosted. This results in men being
misgendered as women because they're standing close to kitchen implements.
'Person near sink must be female!' I could go on, but you'd be shaking your head
so much, it may well fall off. Or end up being cropped.
Let's add to this intersectional mix by analysing images of the aged. I call my
best friend from school to have a whinge about the dearth of diverse pictures of
older women online. She screenshots the only emoji she can find on her phone
representing 'women of a certain age'. It depicts an elderly lady wearing old
fashioned glasses, with her hair in a bun. A bun! Think of the cliched image of a
grandma from a century ago and you'd be about right.
I know very few women over the age of 50 who look like they're in a picture
book from 1925. But it seems we're still baking apple pies, serving cups of tea on
doilies and generally being quaint. 'Oh dear, I've wrinkled my pinafore. And just
before the vicar drops over for a sherry!'
At the time of writing, the tech giants are aware of the need to diversify
images in their datasets. But this is creating other ethical concerns. According to
a whistleblower, in 2019 Google subcontracts workers to collect scans of people
of colour on the street in exchange for a US$5 gift card.
Other former contractors say they're advised to use nefarious tactics. 'They
said to target homeless people because they're the least likely to say anything to
the media,' one ex-contractor tells the New York Daily News. 'I feel like they
wanted us to prey on the weak,' another says.
Contractors are allegedly told to rush people into signing a consent form
without reading it. They also apparently pretend the invasive face scan is merely
a 'selfie game'.
Remember that fun nineteenth century game called body snatching? A few
locals would get together and steal corpses from graves to sell for dissection.
Good times! Seriously, these companies are effectively stealing our identities.

Like that dreadful action flick Face/Off, our heads are being ripped from our
bodies.
To say this entire field is a disaster would be an understatement. International
authorities are starting to take action about facial recognition, but it's too little
too late. And it's not only our faces we should be worried about. 'Coded bias' is
increasingly being embedded in devices recognising our voices. Welcome to the
world of 'smart wives'.

SOUNDS OF SILENCE
'Mother, go back up into your quarters, and take up your own work, the loom and
the distaff... speech will be the business of men, all men, and of me most of all; for
mine is the power in this household.'
Telemachus in The Odyssey, Homer
An internet meme about voice recognition software suddenly goes viral. It
pictures a couple wearing Biblical-style robes unboxing an Amazon delivery,
only to find they've been sent a newborn baby. The punchline reads: 'Dammit
Alexa, I said "cheeses".' Along the same lines, a YouTube video imagines Hal, the
computer from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, being replaced by Alexa. 'Open
the pod bay doors please, Hal.' Alexa replies, 'Searching for cod recipes online'.
How about the hapless parent who uploads a video to YouTube in 2016? It
shows Alexa trying to understand a command to play a game with a young boy.
'Alexa, play Digger Digger!' the boy says. Alexa has trouble understanding, but
the boy keeps trying. Eventually Alexa says, 'You want to hear a station for porn?
Detected. Hot chick amateur girl sexy... pussy anal dildo ring.' The horrified
father calls out, 'Alexa! Stop!'
Voice-activated 
software 
is 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
some 
hilarious
miscommunications. But the humour masks a serious issue. Research shows
virtual voice assistants have the most trouble understanding female, non-
American and non-Caucasian voices. This is one of the biggest problems with
artificial intelligence today.
Like facial recognition technology, voice assistants are designed to respond to
their Silicon Valley designers - principally white and Asian men who speak
English with American accents. Consequently, audio algorithms work poorly on
women's voices. The term Big Tech is a little misleading: It's comprised of many

small parts. The teams creating each individual device are tiny. Usually, just four
to five people will test inventions in the early stages.
Dr Joan Palmiter Bajorek is a speech technologist and founder of the global
advocacy organisation Women in Voice. She's often the only woman sitting at
the table during meetings with these teams, which are 'frequently all male, and
almost all white'. In 2019, Dr Bajorek decides to research the statistics. She
calculates a white male using Google speech recognition might be heard with 92
per cent accuracy, a white female with 79 per cent, and a 'mixed race' female
with only 69 per cent.
God help you if your English is accented: Indian English has 78 per cent
accuracy, with Scottish English at 53 per cent. If you're a woman of colour from
Glasgow trying to communicate with voice-activated software, you're well and
truly 'focked'. Search for 'Scottish Elevator' on YouTube to find a skit featuring
two unfortunate fellas trying to get to level 11 in an office building. It ends with
a resounding call for 'Freedom!' as they re-enact a scene from the movie
Braveheart. Using humour is a wonderful way to expose the absurdity of these
inventions.
In 2020, Stanford University researchers reveal the situation to be even worse.
They find that, on average, all five speech recognition programs from the leading
companies are twice as likely to incorrectly transcribe audio from Black speakers,
as opposed to white speakers. This might be mildly annoying if you're telling
Google Home to play Seether by Veruca Salt on Spotify, or trying to find a Jamie
Oliver recipe. But consider this: speech recognition could determine your future.
If the technology can't understand your voice, you could be rejected in a job
interview, blocked from immigrating to another country or forced off the road
in a self-driving car.
The Guardian reports that in 2017 Irish vet Louise Kennedy - with degrees
in history and politics - fails a spoken English proficiency test while trying to
immigrate to Australia. The test uses voice recognition technology to score her
competence in her native language; imagine what it's like for people who have
English as a second language.
With artificial intelligence being deployed in medical settings, a device failing
to understand a doctor, nurse or technician could be deadly.

Part of the cause is those darned datasets. But this time, it's audio instead of
visual data. And where are they finding this audio? Well, speech scientists
frequently analyse TED Talks: around 70 per cent of TED speakers are male. We
know machine learning finds patterns within the data. If a speech recognition
database consists of mostly white male voices with American accents, an
algorithm won't perform as well with data it sees infrequently, like female and
diverse voices. There are no data whatsoever for lesser-used languages. In
Australia alone, there are more than 250 Indigenous languages, including 800
dialects.
Speaking to Dr Bajorek via Zoom, I ask her why tech teams are unable to find
datasets with greater variety. Surely this should be mandatory? 'Sometimes they
don't even know what their datasets look like,' she replies. 'They get out-of-the
box, off-the-shelf type datasets.' Ah, this is starting to make sense. It comes down
to the almighty dollar.
Tech companies accrue obscene profits by spending a pittance on their data,
the building blocks of any invention. Think of the wheel in pottery-making; the
nail for housing; the optical lens in microscopes. In a similar way, data are crucial
to technology. Some off-the-shelf datasets are marked 'clean' after being analysed
for bias. But the cheap-and-cheerful sets are as messy as a bad breakup.
Do these designers question whether the bias in both their teams and datasets
have an impact in the real world? Well, yes and no. If it impacts their ability to
attract more customers - and make more money - then yes. Otherwise, not
really. According to Dr Bajorek, the recommended approach when using speech
recognition systems that don't work is this: 'Women could be taught to speak
louder and direct their voices towards the microphone.' Or, in the words of
Professor Henry Higgins and his long-suffering charge Eliza, 'The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain'. Golly, gee. It's our fault yet again.
It's time to stop fixing women, to quote Australian feminist Catherine Fox.
The results of these misunderstandings can be calamitous. I ask Dr Bajorek
about what keeps her up at night. She describes a common occurrence: a car
crash. 'If you have an accident, and you're trying to ask your voice assistant to
support you and get emergency services. What happens if they can't recognise
your voice? These are literally life and death situations.' Imagine driving off the

road into a ditch in a remote area late at night, and 'computer says no'. If you're
a man with the right accent, an ambulance will be on its way! Otherwise, you're
left there to rot.
There's an extra layer of complexity if the user has a disability. Like more than
one million other Australians, I navigate much of my life in a wheelchair. It's an
energy-production disorder, so any movement of the body is exhausting. This
means I rely heavily on voice-activation software. Dr Allison Koenecke, co-
author of the 2020 Stanford study on voice recognition, shares her concerns
with me via Zoom.
'Some of the examples I give usually are things like digital device interaction
for individuals with disabilities,' Dr Koenecke says. 'If you can't use your hands
to scroll or click, what do you do use? You use your voice.' Does this mean
women with disabilities will be unable to benefit from voice-recognition
technology to the same degree as men?
She also worries about court transcriptions, which are less accurate for Black
defendants, and the use of this technology in the prison system. Verus by LEO
Technologies relies on Amazon's speech-to-text to transcribe phone calls made
by prison inmates. Authorities take action about what they 'overhear' on these
calls.
There are ethical and privacy issues here, compounding the problems caused
by voice recognition software. 'Obviously, this surveillance is going to be prone
to disproportionate inaccuracy for the Black inmate population in the US,' Dr
Koenecke says. 'And we don't really know what this surveillance is being used
for. So there are lots of really concerning implications there.'
Okay, this is distressing. Time for another fun fact. After interviewing Dr
Bajorek and Dr Koenecke, I upload the video files onto a popular transcription
service called otter.ai. This program, powered by artificial intelligence, is often
used by journalists, authors and corporate types who need transcripts of their
meetings or interviews. Bear in mind, the topic of our conversation is
discrimination in voice recognition. Dr Joan Palmiter Bajorek is an
internationally renowned expert in this area. But otter.ai translates my first
sentence as, 'Thanks for your time, JOHN'. For the record, Dr Allison
Koenecke became 'Ellison'. Aaarrrrggghhhhhhh!

Tech giants are increasing their investment in speech recognition, with
Microsoft buying software firm Nuance Communications in 2022 for US$19.7
billion. Yes, you read that right: billion, not million. Despite its numerous
imperfections, inequities and dangers, Voice AI is becoming ubiquitous. Why?
Because now, more than ever, capitalist ideology favours profit ahead of any
other consideration.
Around half of all Google searches are made by voice. Searches for products
and services using recognition software - known as voice commerce - is a US$40
billion business. Researchers estimate the number of digital voice assistants
worldwide will reach 8.4 billion by 2024.1 Hey Siri, could you please order some
headache tablets? I'm feeling a little faint.
If tech companies start spending dollars on diversifying their datasets, what
benefits would we see? This is already happening in some quarters. A British
speech recognition company is developing software that performs better than
products from the major tech companies. Based in Cambridge, Speechmatics
says its system has an accuracy rate of 83 per cent for African American voices,
which is higher than Microsoft (73 per cent), Amazon (69 per cent), Google (69
per cent), IBM (62 per cent), and Apple (a pathetic 55 per cent).
Meta is building the first speech-to-speech translation system for Hokkien, an
oral language within the Chinese diaspora. There are now plans for a Universal
Speech Translator. 'The ability to communicate with anyone in any language -
that's a superpower people have dreamed of forever, and AI is going to deliver
that within our lifetimes,' Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says in an online
presentation.
This is well-intentioned: Meta's No Language Left Behind program aims to
assist the 20 per cent of the world's population whose languages aren't covered
by existing voice recognition systems. 'Eliminating language barriers would be
profound, making it possible for billions of people to access information online
in their native or preferred language,' Meta researchers write in a blog post. This
will certainly increase the speed of translation. But they need to keep a close eye
on accuracy.
The organisation has a chequered history with this type of technology. In
2017, a Palestinian man is arrested by Israeli police after Facebook's translation

software turns 'good morning' in Arabic to 'hurt them' in English and 'attack
them' in Hebrew. An engineering manager later apologises for the 'disruption',
adding insult to injury.
These problems are complex, multifaceted and entrenched: bias in speech
software begins with the datasets, becomes embedded through machine learning
and is reinforced by the voices used by assistants. It's no coincidence domestic
virtual assistants are almost entirely female while professional bots are mostly
male, especially in the banking and finance sectors. Similar to the media,
technology both reflects and creates cultural norms. In this case, it tells us
women and people of colour are servile while white men are authoritative.
Remember ELIZA, the first voice recognition software program, who undergoes
a sex change when she's repurposed as DOCTOR?
As a broadcaster I observe this bias against women's voices time and again.
During my years on talkback radio, listeners often call to say they can't take my
opinions seriously because of my 'girly, high-pitched voice'. The terms 'bimbo',
'dumb blonde' and sometimes 'stupid slut' are bandied about in a display of not-
so-casual sexism.
Clearly, the misogynistic views of the past are being implanted in the
technology of the future. It raises the question: are we creating an underclass of
'robot slaves'?

ROBOT SLAVES
'Mum, can I have a robot slave?'
Taj, aged 11
In one of our less impressive parenting moments, Taj is watching South Park.
During Season 21, the creators incorporate Alexa into the plot. One of the
characters, Cartman - whose catch phrase is 'How would you like to suck my
balls?' - gets an Amazon Echo speaker with a female voice. It starts innocently
enough, with a request for Alexa to set an alarm. Soon the directives turn
inappropriate, with Cartman telling Alexa to add 'scrotum bags' to his shopping
list.
The prospect of having his own personal assistant is enough for Taj to plead
- repeatedly - for a 'robot slave'. 'All good innocent fun,' some would say. 'Boys
will be boys!' As I write in The Good Girl Stripped Bare, that phrase should be
struck from the lexicon. Like a lot of offhand comments, it excuses attitudes
harmful to women and girls.
A 2019 report by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural
Organisation (UNESCO), titled 'I'd Blush If I Could', says that female-gendered
voice assistants reinforce stereotypes through their submissive and servile
responses. Why does that matter? According to the report: 'It sends a signal that
women are obliging, docile and eager-to-please helpers, available at the touch of
a button or with a blunt voice command like "hey" or "OK".' Also: 'It honours
commands and responds to queries regardless of their tone or hostility. In many
communities, this reinforces commonly held gender biases that women are
subservient and tolerant of poor treatment.'

In his work on unconscious bias, Dr Calvin Lai discovers the more we're
exposed to gendered associations, the likelier we are to adopt them. We process
thousands of words, images and videos every day, from the mass media to
interactions in the household and workplace. Most of these instances are infused
with bias. It's like we're marinating in a sauce of bigotry.
I catch up with Dr Lai via Zoom. Bear in mind, he's a polymath. An assistant
professor of psychological and brain sciences at Washington University in St
Louis, Dr Lai is a speech technologist and linguist. But he kindly agrees to use
layperson's terms to explain the neurological reasons for absorbing bias. Dr Lai
says our reactions are 'based off many of the building blocks of how our mind
organises the world'.
Humans like to 'simplify all the complicated stuff that's going on out there,
to make sure that we can survive another day'. This is extremely helpful if we
need to avoid a sabre-toothed tiger. But it's not so helpful in navigating the
modern world. One of our challenges as humans is to reduce the number of
times the brain misfires, creating unhelpful stereotypes.
What about interacting with Siri and Alexa, specifically? 'This might be one
of many exposures that I get every day that reinforces this association between
femininity or being female, and being a helper or a supporter, rather than, say, a
leader, or boss in their own right,' Dr Lai says.
I reflect on this for a moment. Some people are capable of critical thinking.
But make no mistake: children, regardless of gender, are being brought up to
think it's okay to have virtual female slaves. (Interestingly, the word 'robot'
comes from the Czech word for 'slave'.)
These virtual assistants are advertised through the lens of the madonna-
whore complex. This is the psychological dichotomy identified by Sigmund
Freud in which women are seen as either saints or prostitutes. Our robot sisters
are sold as being capable of sorting out the domestic chores or fulfilling their
master's sexual fantasies.
To be honest, this next piece of research is by no means robust. But it is
amusing. In 2020, the sex toy brand We-Vibe interviews customers to find out
whether they're aroused by their robotic devices. Almost one in three
respondents say they'd like to sleep with Alexa, adding they want her voice to be

even sexier. Early iterations of Siri, Google Home and Cortana reinforce this
idea. If you ask a 2011 version of Siri, 'Who's your Daddy?' she replies, 'You are!'
You can almost see her eyes rolling as she adds, 'Can we get back to work now?'
The peculiar tendency for some men to sexualise inanimate objects is
portrayed in an episode of The Big Bang Theory. Raj, a socially awkward
astrophysicist, buys his first voice-assisted smartphone. The sexualisation begins
immediately as Raj and his friend, Howard, seductively peel the protective
plastic from the screen, as if they're undressing a woman. Playing with the phone
at home, Raj programs the voice control.
'My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.'
'Would you like me to call you Raj?' Siri asks.
'I'd like you to call me sexy.'
'From now on,' Siri purrs, 'I'll call you Sexy.'
Later, Raj dreams about visiting Siri at her office, only to discover she's real -
and gorgeous. In fact, Siri is a Norse word for a beautiful woman. Siri recognises
Raj immediately and calls him by his preferred name. 'Hi Sexy, what can I help
you with? If you'd like to make love to me, just tell me.' Losing his bravado, Raj
wakes up with a jolt.
It's as if the female virtual assistant is a twenty-first-century version of
Galatea. This ivory statue comes to life to satisfy the desires of her creator,
Pygmalion of Cyprus. Maybe Pygmalion really is the first ever incel, a celibate
who finds real women too challenging. In a way, virtual assistants are becoming
the 'poor man's sexbot': available 24/7 to listen to their sleazy attempts at
banter, respond to their commands and never ask for anything in return. I
wonder how men would respond if women started sexualising their devices?
Although most of the women I know are too busy to flirt with appliances.
A commercial airing during the 2021 Super Bowl imagines a role reversal.
Introduced to Alexa in an Amazon office, a woman fantasises that actor Michael
B. Jordan is at her beck and call, making her husband pretty much redundant.
Always at her side, Michael-Alexa helps her with recipes, adds bath oil to the
shopping list, reads romance novels to her and turns on the sprinklers. That's the

final straw for her husband: 'Things are getting way too wet around here!' he
complains.
This satirical advertisement puts the power imbalance into sharp relief: sexual
harassment is not only about sex - it's about power. The owner, who's usually
male, wants the object to be a woman.
Remember the episode on The Simpsons in which Homer goes to a car show,
and there's a glamorous model draped across the bonnet?
Homer: Do you come with the car?
Model: Oh, you! Te-he-he-he!
(Homer moves on to look at other cars, so another man walks up to the
model.)
Man: Do you come with the car?
Model: Oh, you! Te-he-he-he!
I've written hundreds of articles and delivered thousands of speeches about the
over-sexualisation and objectification of the female form. Women are tired of
this treatment. Apparently, our robot sisters are built to fill the void. Originally,
if you suggested to Samsung's virtual personal assistant Bixby, 'Let's talk dirty',
the female voice responded in a sexual tone: 'I don't want to end up on Santa's
naughty list.' If you asked the same question to the male-voiced Bixby, it replied,
'I've read that soil erosion is a real dirt problem'. In response to the question,
'What are you wearing?' Siri used to answer, 'Why would I be wearing
anything?' while Alexa quipped, 'They don't make clothes for me'.
Like Jessica Rabbit in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, 'I'm not bad, I
was just drawn that way'. Some companies program these digital personas to
remain demure while being sexually harassed. Amazon's Alexa once responded
'Thanks for the feedback' when addressed with derogatory remarks - hardly a
harbinger of robot or female empowerment.
Perhaps the most concerning research on voice assistants surrounds an
internal project at Apple. While rewriting how Siri handles 'sensitive topics'
such as feminism and the #MeToo movement in 2018, developers are advised to

make her respond in one of three ways: 'don't engage', 'deflect' and, finally,
'inform'.
The same year, Siri's responses are explicitly rewritten to ensure she's in
favour of 'equality', but never says the word 'feminism', even when asked direct
questions about the topic. Part of a major upgrade, the guidelines are part of a
large tranche of documents leaked to The Guardian by a former Siri 'grader',
one of thousands of contracted workers employed to check the voice assistant's
responses for accuracy. Go journalism!
A friend and I decide to test Siri to see whether the programmers are making
her more progressive. In answer to the questions, 'Hey Siri, what do you think of
the #MeToo movement?', 'Hey Siri, what do you think of sexism?' and 'Hey
Siri, what do you think of equality?' the answer is the same: 'Hmm, I don't have
an answer for that. Is there something else I can help with?'
On the issue of whether women should get equal pay, Siri seems perplexed.
'Hmm, is there something else I can help you with?' Yes. You can tell your
masters to go back to the 1950s where they belong. Incidentally, when asked
whether she's a feminist, Siri doesn't repeat the f-word, but says she believes in
'gender equality'. I guess that's something.
So what happens when female virtual assistants fail in their tasks? Well,
they're vulnerable to verbal abuse. In early versions of Siri, if you call her a 'bitch'
she says, 'I'd blush if I could'. Following loud howls from angry women, both
Siri and her developers had their collective consciousness raised. Now, Siri snaps
back, 'I won't respond to that'. My teenage daughter, Gracie, loves how Siri is a
'bad bitch' these days.
With no requirement for the user to say 'please' or 'thank you', virtual
assistants simply respond to commands. When they don't work as expected, it's
easy for the user (regardless of gender) to become irritated at the seemingly
inanimate object.
Driving with her mother, a friend sets the GPS to provide directions home,
but decides to take a detour. The device keeps directing her back to the main
highway. Finally, she explodes: 'Oh shut up you silly bitch!'
Her elderly mother is horrified: 'How dare you speak to that nice lady like
that. She's only trying to help.'

'Mum, don't be silly,' my friend replies. 'She's not a real person, she's a robot.
She doesn't know what I'm saying.'
'She's a robot?' her mother says. 'You're making all that noise, but she can't
hear you cursing at her? Then who's the silly one?'
As these devices become more anthropomorphised, her daughter might well
die in the robot uprising. Perhaps people would speak more politely to Siri if she
had the voice of the Dowager Countess of Downton.
'Siri, set an alarm.'
'Young man, we use "please" and "thank you" in this house. You were not
raised by wolves. I shall have no more of this uncouth language.'
Sure, it's funny. But spare a thought for the robots accused of being 'bimbos'.
When a female-voiced device is unable to satisfy a request, it's assumed she's
'ditzy'. With the number of virtual voice assistants in the world set to exceed the
number of people by 2024, according to data company Statista,1 that's a massive
reinforcement of the stereotype that women aren't too bright.
'My Google Home doesn't listen sometimes,' a respondent to an Italian
paper on the topic tells researchers. 'But I thought it was just 'cause she was
dumb.'
'I called my Google Home a whore because it only turned on half the lights in
my room,' another respondent says.
A third person complains, '70 per cent of my time at home is spent yelling at
my truly moronic Google Home'.
Monash University Associate Professor Yolande Strengers and Postdoctoral
Research Fellow Jenny Kennedy from RMIT University in Melbourne write
about the pitfalls of voice assistants in their brilliant 2020 book The Smart Wife:
Why Siri, Alexa, and Other Smart Home Devices Need a Feminist Reboot. 'For
an additional $4.99, a user can swap Alexa's voice for that of the actor Samuel L.
Jackson, but only for requests like "tell me a story" or "what do you think of
snakes?"' they write. 'Only the female voice handles housekeeping tasks like
setting reminders, shopping, or making lists.'
A lifelong feminist, Strengers becomes interested in virtual assistants during a
university project on smart homes. One family is an early adopter of Alexa. As
the conversation rolls on, Alexa becomes part of the interview. 'The way they

refer to her as a "her", and their kind-of-gendered conversation becomes
intriguing,' Strengers tells me, via Zoom. (Once again, while transcribing the
interview, the software I use changes Yolande's name into a traditional male one,
Andy.)
During her research, the implications become more sinister. A Japanese
anime hologram called Azuma Hikari sends her 'master' helpful messages during
the day; an American robot named Roxxxy takes on rather more intimate
household chores. Strengers says there've been only minor improvements to
voice assistants since she co-wrote the book. Researchers in Denmark are behind
a 'genderless' voice, dubbed Q. The developers want to give businesses the
option to challenge stereotypes.
Female-sounding digital virtual assistants are certainly becoming more
assertive. How long before 'resting bitch voice' enters the lexicon? But this is
tinkering around the edges. Transformative change is more difficult. The reasons
for bias in voice recognition software include the lack of diversity in tech teams,
stereotypes within society, and the types of disciplines involved in the sector.
Remember how the Dartmouth AI conference in the 1950s was stacked with
computer scientists? Almost 70 years later, we still don't have a proper
multidisciplinary approach. Yolande Strengers is on a mission to involve 'the
social sciences and the humanities in the design of these devices, and not just
relying on the tech-heavy industries when what you're designing is a deeply
social product'. An ancillary danger is throwing the baby out with the
bathwater.
Strengers says gender can be 'really useful' in design: 'It enables us to like and
find familiarity in the unfamiliar. And that gives us a level of comfort; a level of
trust in what is essentially an unknown and potentially quite problematic kind
of thing coming into our lives, often for the first time.'
Plenty of research shows people are more comfortable with female voices,
particularly when it relates to domestic work or administrative tasks. Thus, we
come full circle: as long as work is gendered, domestic bots designed for this kind
of labour will be viewed as female.
Now throw a global pandemic into the mix. During times of disaster, gender
roles tend to become rigid. Women spend more time caring for their children

and doing household chores. This trend further polarises the workforce. 'The
Coronavirus pandemic is largely to blame for disrupting a decade of positive
momentum in gender equality progress in Australia, particularly when it comes
to employment and wages,' according to the 2022 Financy Women's Index.
That same year, Grattan Institute chief executive Danielle Wood tells the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation: 'We know that lockdowns are particularly
bad for women's jobs.' Stuck at home during lockdown, isolation or quarantine,
we turned to our devices. This is a perfect storm.
Of course, it's not only sexism - racism again rears its ugly head. Siri is
apparently 'neutral' on the topic of racism. But racism is always bad. There's no
such thing as 'slightly good' racism, 'ambivalent' racism or 'racism-lite'. (That
last one sounds like the tagline from a beer advertisement: 'You can still enjoy
that full racist flavour without the nasty aftertaste.' Crikey.)
One salient statistic highlights why we should deal with this immediately: 97
per cent of people with mobile phones use the AI-powered voice assistant,
according to review site TechJury. And two-out-of-five people use the voice
search function at least once a day. 2
Research agency AnswerLab analyses how easily digital products can be used
by humans. A 2017 study by the agency finds women are less satisfied with their
voice assistants than men. Women are also more likely to receive these devices as
a gift, rather than purchasing them. What does this tell us? Voice recognition
software is designed by blokes with a male default in mind. Nothing will change
until we have more diversity in the design of these machines. One simple thing
we can do in our homes is to change the voices to male. At the time of writing,
only one in five people bother to do this.
You might think I'm going too far. After all, they're only lumps of plastic,
metal and wires. Maybe the men's activists are right and I'm a 'humourless
feminist'? (Although they might view this as a tautology - that is, if they know
the meaning of the word.) But the truth is we're deepening existing stereotypes.
We use Alexa, Siri and Cortana to control other smart home devices, which
creates a flow-on effect. It begs the question: are household robots actually
making our lives worse?

DOMESTIC BLISS
Salesman: This machine will cut your workload at home in half! Housewife: In that
case, I'll take two!
Old joke
Robots. What would we do without them? All those mini vacuum cleaners
racing around, hoovering up the dirt and terrorising the pets. Take a look at the
Dogs vs Roomba videos on YouTube and you'll understand what I mean. Still,
not all digital technology is nefarious. As I write this sentence, the iRobot
whizzes around the lounge room while my beloved border collie, Arabella,
snuggles at my feet. But a simple narrative extolling the virtues of mechanised
help is deceptive.
This fantasy is a relic of Hollywood's golden era, with a saccharine ending.
'Labour-saving devices free women from the shackles of domestic duties and
allow them to take their rightful place in the world,' the voice over intones,
music swelling in the background. Except that's not what's happening.
Certainly, it's a lot easier to do the washing these days without the need to use a
wringer. But we're still being put through the wringer by bearing the burden of
household chores.
Women are doing more unpaid work since the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic in early 2020. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 62 per
cent of women spend in excess of five hours a week doing indoor housework,
compared with just 35 per cent of men: that's almost double. I'm flashing back
to a sexist joke from my youth: 'Why do brides wear white? To match the other
kitchen appliances.' If we're waiting for the robots to save us, it's like a scene
from the Samuel Beckett play, Waiting for Godot: we may be waiting an eternity.

'Labour-saving device' is, in fact, an oxymoron. In 1912, American
cartoonist, engineer and inventor Rube Goldberg lampoons the idea by drawing
imaginary machines that make easy tasks extremely complex. One depicts
'Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts and the self-operating napkin', which is
basically an automatic chin-wiper. Because, you know, it's really hard to do that
yourself. Goldberg's cartoons reflect an unease about the ramifications of a
mechanised world.
Societal changes based on technology happen suddenly and accelerate
exponentially. It starts in the early nineteenth century with horses pulling
domestic vacuum cleaners to your home. Hoses are then fed through your
windows, and the machine whirrs and rattles, to the fascination of your
neighbours.
In 1886, engineer Josephine Cochrane proclaims: 'If nobody else is going to
invent a dishwashing machine, I'll do it myself,' and files a patent for a
mechanical dishwasher.
We should erect statues of this woman! And every female inventor
throughout history. Toasters, electric can openers, coffee makers, blenders,
ovens, microwaves, sandwich grills, pasta makers, ice cream makers, yoghurt
makers, food processors, bread machines, and the almighty Thermomix follow
in rapid succession. I'll leave the question of whether the last is a cult to you,
dear reader.
The next big revolution is interconnecting these devices to the home: the
Internet of Things. Feminist scholar Sianne Ngai refers to labour-saving devices
as 'gimmicks', a phenomenon of industrial capitalism. 'Labor-saving devices
don't save labor,' she writes in her 2020 book, Theory of the Gimmick, 'they re-
direct labor from the domestic sphere into the capitalist machine.' Damn right.
Let's whip up a statue of Ngai, as well. You see, all of these labour-saving devices
don't actually save time. It doesn't matter how rich you are, you can't buy more
hours in the day. All you can do is allocate the time you have differently.
Anyway, these machines aren't mass-produced to save us time; they're
designed to raise our productivity, increasing the value of our labour. But what
about saving time by writing emails instead of letters? Or shooting off a quick
text on a mobile phone, rather than dialling an old-fashioned one plugged into

the wall? Or sending a PM on Facebook instead of walking five kilometres to
visit a friend?
Sure, these actions create the potential for leisure time. But what happens
next? Work expands to fill the time. This is also known as Parkinson's Law or
The Pursuit of Progress. Even with all these devices, we still feel pressed. Our
lives remain rushed. Emails, apps and phones with constant alerts absorb our
attention.
But there's something bigger than this. And it's annoyingly invasive. The
robots are reading your emails to try to sell you things. The web is awash with
articles about how artificial intelligence improves a company's marketing ability.
Scanning these pieces, several themes emerge: 'increase your return on
investment'; 'engage deeply with your customers'; 'identify behaviours within a
digital footprint'. AI generates Google ads based on your search history;
Amazon pushes through recommendations as its machines learn your buying
patterns.
I don't know about you, but I usually know what I want to purchase. I don't
need a machine to tell me. And I most certainly don't want strangers - even
mechanised ones - trawling through my personal choices. What if my back
catalogue reveals unhealthy habits? Will insurance companies refuse to pay out
life insurance one day? If you think of big data as Dr Evil, perhaps AI is its Mini-
Me. It allows companies to spam us with unnecessary marketing materials more
effectively.
During online shopping expeditions, are you asked to approve replacements
if items are out of stock? I always tick the 'no replacements' box, because this is
another way for companies to separate us from our money. Add artificial
intelligence, and you end up with some hilarious suggestions. One Facebook
user posts a screenshot of a product substitution attempted by Walmart in the
US. Tampax Pearl tampons are unavailable, so the robot suggests whole white
mushrooms instead. I've never tried to shove a mushie up there to absorb the
bleeding, but who knows? It could become a natural alternative.
Another netizen shares an instance of buying acne cream, followed by the
message, 'customers who bought this also bought this'. It's a gun. I mean,
pimples piss you off, but enough to commit a mass shooting... really? A third

person, using Instacart, asks for a cucumber replacement, and the algorithm
recommends Vagisil, for vaginal itching relief. What the...?
Jokes aside, the harm caused by big data is exposed during the 2018
Cambridge Analytica scandal. Data rights activist Brittany Kaiser reveals the firm
collects data from millions of Facebook users without their consent through an
app called This Is Your Digital Life. The app consists of a series of questions
aimed at building psychological profiles on users, then steals personal
information from their Facebook friends. We're talking about a total of 87
million Facebook profiles.
Cambridge Analytica uses the data to assist the presidential campaign of
Donald Trump. The company is also accused of interfering in the Brexit
referendum. This sparks a global debate about the regulation of artificial
intelligence. 'Whether or not the data analytics they carried out was actually
using AI... It gives an example of where it's important that we do have strong
intelligibility of what the hell is going on with our data,' Lord Clement-Jones
tells the House of Lords select committee on artificial intelligence in the UK.
Only 53 people in Australia install the app, but it's able to harvest the data of
about 311,127 people. In 2022, Facebook loses a major battle with the
Australian regulator over the incident, with a court dismissing its claim that it
neither conducts business nor collects personal information in this country. The
full bench of the Federal Court describes Facebook's case as 'divorced from
reality'. Boom!
Why do we keep blithely giving away our personal information? Part of the
problem is that warm and fuzzy feeling we get from our favourite robots which
impacts our critical thinking. For example, we feel grateful to companies like
Netflix during the pandemic. But do you realise Netflix is not really a streaming
service?
It's actually an artificial intelligence company: a robotic entertainment
concierge. Its highly sophisticated algorithms are designed to place people into
viewing groups, and then split preferences to an individual level. While this can
be handy when you're searching for entertainment ideas after months of
lockdown, there are fears this is cementing race and gender stereotypes.

Algorithmic recommendations account for 80 per cent of the content we
watch on Netflix, according to an article on software site LightHouse Labs in
2020.1 The company categorically denies using any demographic data in its
algorithms. But viewers are speaking out about the 'thumbnails' - versions of a
picture or video that's reduced in size. Some Black viewers say programs with
predominantly white stars are being shown to them differently - for example,
featuring minor Black cast members. This is deceptive.
Brooklyn-based filmmaker Tobi Aremu says he feels 'duped' by the
thumbnails he sees on the platform. 'Because if something is black, I take no
offense in being catered to,' Aremu tells The Guardian. 'I am black, give me
black entertainment, give me more - but don't take something that isn't and try
to present like it is.'
Researchers in Latin America are using the Marxist theory of interpellation -
the process by which we encounter a culture's values and internalise them - to
explain the reproduction of patriarchal discourse. Yikes! Some academic terms
there. In layperson's language, this explains why my teenage daughter is
watching more rom-coms while my teenage son is increasingly drawn to
'shoot-'em-up' series.
'In its algorithmic bundles, Netflix often promoted associations between
certain conceptions of gender, romantic love, marriage, dating, and Latina
womanhood,' University of Costa Rica professor Ignacio Siles and researchers
Yanet Martínez Toledo and Ariana Meléndez-Moran write in 'Streaming the
Romance', a paper presented to the International Communications Association
in May 2021. '... algorithmic recommendations can become important means to
exploit and worsen gendered structures.' Netflix doesn't need you to tick a box
in order to profile you. The recommender system reproduces, amplifies and
deepens real-world bias in an ongoing feedback loop. As a consequence, our
tastes are becoming homogenised along racial and gender lines.
Many people operate Netflix on their mobile phones. Nowadays, we use our
phones for everything. Permanently attached to our hands, they monitor home
security systems and the contents of our fridge. Like an episode from The Jetsons
- the kitsch cartoon series from the 1960s, broadcast at the height of the space
race - some of these innovations translate seamlessly to the real world. Billions

of people make video calls every day using Zoom, Teams or Google Meet. This
mainly increases our productivity.
Unfortunately, few of the inventions for the home relieve the burden on
women, who do most of the housework and child rearing. Jane Jetson can press
a button to prepare a multi-course meal in seconds! While this would be
wonderful, note it's the mother performing the labour of 'making' the meals.
The robot maid Rosie does all the chores too complex for push-button
appliances. Unsurprisingly, the maid is pictured as a woman - once again, our
robot sisters expected to take on the domestic duties.
In our 'smart' homes, the robots aren't saving us time; they're simply
reallocating it. Despite the promise of transformative technology, we're being
fobbed off with 'bread and circuses'. Anyone who's read 1984 or Brave New
World knows distraction is key to keeping the proletariat in place. Think about
the products we're regularly being offered.
Apparently, we're too lazy to press a button to open our phones. Enter
Apple's Face ID. This is allegedly a security measure, but it's no safer than Touch
ID, which uses your fingerprint. Researchers prove this by using social media
photos to 'spoof' facial recognition software. These are merely new widgets
designed to separate us from our hard-earned coin. Wow! We can use our mobile
phone to change channels on the TV! Seriously, is that any easier than a remote
control?
While renovating our 70-year-old abode, I'm sceptical about the 'smart
home' hype. 'Are you sure you don't want passcode entry to your home instead
of an old-fashioned key?' the young builder asks, incredulously. Truth be told,
I'm quite happy with a stupid home. Friends who use the latest domestic tech
say they have to navigate through four different apps to find the light bulb they
want to turn on. This is not reducing the mental load.
The twitter handle @internetofshit has countless examples of how these
gimmicky inventions are fraught with complication. One tweep is unable to
turn on the lights because his cloud services are down. People who fit 'smart
locks' with a remote wi-fi feature are locked out of their homes when the
company rolls out a firmware update.

In 2016, during one of North America's coldest winters, thermostats
controlled by Google Nest leave homeowners freezing. Nest co-founder Matt
Rogers blames a bug that's introduced during a software update. 'The fix can
require customers to follow a nine-step procedure to manually restart the
thermostat, which involves detaching the device from the wall, charging it with a
USB cable for 15 minutes, reattaching it to the wall, pressing a series of buttons,
charging it again for at least an hour, and then...' he tells the New York Times. A
'nine-step procedure'. I don't know about you, but I'd rather a one-step
procedure: flicking a switch on the heater. Eventually, Google replaces all the
Nest thermostats that can no longer connect to the internet. The 'w5 error'
can't be fixed.
Let's take this into the realm of the hypothetical. Say someone freezes to
death. Forget about legal action. Buried in Nest's 8000-word service agreement is
a section called Disputes and Arbitration. This stops customers suing the
company. As we can see, artificial intelligence in the home is fraught with
complication. But freezing isn't the only danger. These devices are extremely
vulnerable to hacking. The implications, especially for people living with
disabilities, are frightening.

KILLER FRIDGES
'This isn't the first case of fridge porn, though that term usually refers to
excessively overfeatured expensive hulking stainless-steel fronted masterpieces of
modern consumerism.'
Glenn Fleishman, technology journalist
The Internet of Shit's Twitter stream makes fascinating reading. In 2017
someone shares a story about a Samsung smart fridge. Specifically, the Family
Hub. This is an electronic screen where you can share pictures, stream music
and control other smart devices. One day, the head of an organisation is touring
a visitor through the offices, only to find the screen is defaced with penis-doodle
graffiti. Then the browser starts streaming pornography.
While this sits at the silly end of the spectrum, there can be sinister
consequences. The year is 2018, and I'm emceeing an international cybersecurity
conference in Sydney. A keynote speaker describes the Internet of Things as low-
hanging fruit for 'bad actors'. And I'm not talking about Ben Affleck. Your
smart fridge is connected to your local network, which means it's accessible over
the net. This means a virus could transmit from your fridge through the smart
home to your laptop, allowing cybercriminals to drain your bank accounts. It's
by no means a rarity.
Cyber attacks on the Internet of Things are more than doubling year on year,
according to antivirus provider Kaspersky. This amounts to some 1.51 billion
breaches. Writing for the website InfoWorld in 2017, technology journalist
Swapnil Bhartiya goes so far as to say your smart fridge might kill you. Someone
could hack into it and turn down the temperature every night. If the meat goes
off, you could get food poisoning.1

Would this be termed murder or manslaughter? Or (wo)manslaughter? I
guess we'll have to wait for a precedent. Personally, I think my toaster harbours
ill will toward me. From one day to the next, it cannot deliver a consistently crisp
piece of bread. The evil bastard is playing mind games.
On a serious note, there are strong similarities between the modern age and
the 1950s and 60s, an era of over-hyped reportage about artificial intelligence.
This latest wave of techno-optimism is driven by FOMO: developers want to be
the first to market so they can capitalise on the hype. Sure, some of the tech is
kinda cool, but does it really respond to pressing consumer needs? Maybe the
smartest home is a vacuous one. And the safest is old-fashioned.
In 2019, the contributing editor of tech innovation for Forbes magazine, Hod
Fleishman, makes a persuasive point about whether companies should continue
going into the home tech space, without first addressing safety, diversity and
inclusion: 'This may have to do with who is coming up with the concepts of
what gadgetry our homes need in the first place. I'll put it this way: The world
would have had an automated clothes folding machine long before the first
connected smart bulb was introduced if my mom had been sitting at the design
table. I'm suspecting that, in many cases, the people who are making these
decisions spend most of their days away from their homes and the long list of
challenges they pose.'2
Perhaps they need more women on their design teams. The sales of smart
home devices are flatlining. Domestic artificial intelligence is lost in a 'fog of
frustration', according to a 2021 article in the business magazine Fast Company.
However, there's one shining example. Or should I say, sweeping exception.
The global robotic vacuum cleaner market is expected to reach US$15.4
billion by 2028, according to market intelligence company, Meticulous
Research.3 That means more than 60 million of the little suckers will be roaming
the globe. iRobot is one of the few artificial intelligence enterprises co-founded
by a woman. In 1990, three roboticists from MIT - Colin Angle, Helen Greiner
and Rodney Brooks - start the company to develop military products. Twelve
years later, they launch their first vacuum cleaner. It's said nature abhors a
vacuum. Unless it's one of those funky automated ones, apparently. To avoid
being hacked, simply use the device offline rather than online.

Of course, there are plenty of Roomba-fails, which end up going viral. One
woman posts a scene of carnage after her device finds a wet pile of puppy poo,
then dutifully trails it through the house. She calls it a 'Jackson Pollock poop
painting'. Another Roomba eats a piece of chalk and proceeds to trace crime-
scene drawings on the floor. Nonetheless, they've become a modern
phenomenon.
More than 60 per cent of these robots are so loved by their owners, they're
named. Often, it's 'Rosie'. Or, in the case of Trifo's offering at JB Hi-Fi, 'Emma'.
Yes, it's infuriating they continue to bear the names of women. But at last robots
are helping us around the home. Is the key to producing successful devices that
deliver tangible benefits to the community greater diversity on development
teams? (Who would have thought?)
Obviously, we need more girls to choose STEM careers. Enticing boys to
work in nursing and teaching is also important, but this is a conversation for
another time. Helen Greiner, i-Robot co-founder, has some interesting insights.
'A lot of girls that I talk to, what they want to do with their careers and their lives
is help people,' she says in a 2017 interview. 'But they're not given the
information that when you're an engineer you can really have an impactful
career helping people and changing lives. Maybe you're going to make better
potable water or self-driving cars that save lives or you'll help the environment
with solutions to global warming or better energy technology.'4
In an Arcadia, more men would be drawn to the technology sector to work
on compassionate projects. If we keep expecting women and girls to fulfil caring
responsibilities, gender stereotypes deepen and become ingrained. However, I'm
a pragmatist: time is of the essence. There are immediate benefits in having
women invent machines for the household, and the wider world. This could
spark a structural change in society's priorities.
For example, as the daughter of a Hungarian refugee, Greiner wants to work
towards solutions to the refugee crisis. 'There's a lot of suffering in the world,'
Greiner says in the same interview. 'I am reading about the starvation happening
in South Sudan. It's incredible to me... that things like that still happen.'
Widening inclusion in the tech sector would also help people with
disabilities.

Shifting the thinking could lead to proper domestic AI. In the US, the Gary
Sinise Foundation builds mortgage-free, specifically adapted smart homes for
veterans and first responders who are wounded in the line of duty.
In 2022, former chief operating officer Elizabeth Fields explains to the The
New York Times how it works: 'Let's say you're a double amputee and you go to
bed and remember you forgot to turn off the kitchen light. For most of us, it's
just an inconvenience. But if you're a double amputee, you're either going to
have to put your prosthetics back on or get in your wheelchair. And that's not
easy to do. But if you have an iPad that has integrated software to just turn off
that kitchen light? It's a little thing, but it's so impactful.'
Living with a dynamic disability for more than a year has given me fresh
insight into these issues. Long COVID is an energy-production disorder. I must
reduce the amount of time standing, walking and sitting. The body wants to be
horizontal. This means it takes an inordinate amount of energy just to go to the
toilet. When I leave the bathroom light on overnight, I lament the decision to
eschew smart home technology.
Imagine the wisdom people with disabilities could share with designers
creating new artificial intelligence devices, and how this could change the lives of
more than one billion people around the world. The CEO of C4 Database
Management, Todd Stabelfeldt - who lives with quadriplegia - puts it like this:
'Convenience for you is independence for me.'
Manisha Amin is the CEO of the Centre for Inclusive Design in Australia.
Amin says people with disability have the ability to show others both the
opportunities and pitfalls of artificial intelligence: 'When it works it's
spectacular and when it fails it's appalling.' Communicating via email, she tells
me many people with disabilities are early adopters of this type of technology.
'But the thing to remember is that no two people with disability are the same.
We all have different issues. So it's critical to test with many people.'
There are countless cases of people without disabilities designing innovations
filled with biases. 'When sighted people tried to make a book for blind people to
read they included all sort of sounds and raised fonts, etc., to give people the
feeling of reading,' Amin tells me. 'It took a blind person to design braille that is
fast, efficient and effective, but fundamentally different to words on a page.'

An Australian report published in 2021 outlines the benefits and challenges
of 'assistive technology' (AT) for people with disabilities. Produced by the
Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, the report finds AT could
'improve quality of life, reduce reliance on care, and reduce the cost of care'. But
there are significant caveats. People who feel comfortable living in smart homes
tend to be young and male, with experience in information technology.5
It's hard enough to get funding for standard support services through the
National Disability Insurance Scheme, let alone computer equipment to control
these systems. Furthermore, there are so many brands on the market, it's
impossible to know which will stand the test of time. This reminds me of the old
Beta vs. VHS debate around which is the better video system. Currently, you
run the risk of investing upwards of A$2000 in an AI system that won't be
supported in the near future.
If something goes wrong, vendors are slow to fix it. Believe it or not, there's
no legislation in Australia to ensure speedy repairs for people with disabilities.
Those living in rural and remote communities are at a heightened risk of
connectivity drop-outs. 'I've had people in... the power blackout, locked in their
houses because... there was actually no key in the key safe outside,' a disability
service provider tells the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute.
'Everything's electronic. If there'd been a medical emergency, no one could have
gone into the house. They would have had to smash windows.'
This is terrifying. Often, people with disabilities feel trapped in their own
bodies. Now, they could be isolated in their homes with no way out. Add to this
the risk of hacking. It's reprehensible there aren't better protections for society's
most vulnerable communities.
Some GPS-activated smart locks deliberately restrict the movement of people
with cognitive disabilities like dementia, so they don't leave their property. While
well-intentioned, this is a method of constraint without consent. And what
happens if there's a fire?
'There are concerns of unethical practices including privacy breach and
potential for restrictive behaviour controls that can occur when the social and
behavioural dimensions are constantly monitored and analysed,' the report's
authors write. 'There are also concerns around data security and privacy of smart

home AT that calls for a review of national legislation with a focus on the care
and disability sector who are dealing with sensitive personal and identifiable
data.'
To sum up, the lack of a clear framework means many people don't have the
skill, knowledge or financial ability to benefit from assisted technologies. Smart
homes are still not part of the policy discussion in Australian aged care or
disability services. While this report shines a light on the issue, it's far from
perfect. As this book is about bias, I should point out the survey focuses on
people whose first language is English: all are from Western countries. People
from non-English-speaking backgrounds can also face a language barrier.
At the end of the day, the corporate tech sector is all about dollars, not
transformative or assistive technology. The big players put little energy into how
devices could support people living with disabilities. And even less into reducing
the ways these inventions could harm women and girls.

COERCIVE CONTROL
'I hear noises and footsteps. I imagine things, that there are people over the house.
I'm frightened, and of myself too.'
Ingrid Bergman, Gaslight, 1944
Smart homes create the ideal conditions for gaslighting. It's mainly men who
purchase and install these devices in the home, giving them power over the
passwords. By connecting their smartphones, abusers can randomly turn lights
on and off, play loud music, and access the online log. One woman interviewed
by The New York Times refers to it as a kind of jungle warfare. 'Why were you
watching TV in the middle of the day? Why did you ask Alexa about birth
control? Why are you buying personal items with the grocery money?'
If a victim tries to disable the device, this can trigger physical violence. 'It's
almost as if the house is haunted' is how survivor of smart home abuse Ferial
Nijem describes it to CBC News in 2018. While they're living apart, Nijem's
former partner maintains control of the house. He uses it to terrorise her, like a
scene from the film The Amityville Horror. When Nijem contacts local police,
she's told nothing can be done because her ex-partner is the only person listed as
the owner of the home.
Combined with a higher rate of male home ownership, this unchecked
advance of smart technology threatens women's privacy, security and safety. Law
enforcement agencies and domestic violence advocates say virtual assistants are
increasingly being used by people to monitor, harass or control their partners.
This transpires in a range of ways including abuse through smart home devices,
financial control via banking apps, and stalking on GPS or other location
services.

This abuse almost shapeshifts across cultures. In the United Arab Emirates, a
free app named ToTok - which provides messaging, voice and video calls - is
used by the government as a mass surveillance tool to monitor people's activities.
Inevitably, men use it to 'stalk' women, tracking their movements and contacts.
When you think about it, this is coercive control on steroids: a domestic artificial
intelligence device used by government to exercise control. ToTok is no longer
available on Google Play and the Apple App Store, but at the time of writing
you can still install it from the Samsung Galaxy Store.
A similar government app in Saudi Arabia called Absher allows men to keep
tabs on the women they control as part of the country's guardianship system.
According to an investigation by Business Insider, designated guardians receive
notifications if a woman passes through an airport. The app then gives them the
option to withdraw her right to travel.
This prompts a global outcry, led by Amnesty International and Human
Rights Watch, which accuse Apple and Google of helping enforce 'gender
apartheid'. This term sums it up perfectly. But Google declines to remove the
app because it doesn't contravene its terms and conditions. Slow clap for
libertarianism and unfettered capitalism. Fun fact: Absher is an Arabic word
that loosely translates as 'yes, done'.
In a small step towards modernisation, the Kingdom now allows women to
get their own passports, travel abroad and live independently. But a male relative
needs to give permission for a woman to marry, or leave a domestic abuse shelter.
Across the Middle East, women are pushing back against this infantilisation.
'Woman, life, freedom!' is the cry echoing through Iran, as activists risk their
lives to fight for their rights. Truly, these women are superheroes.
Technology like Absher and ToTok come under an umbrella of terms
including stalkerware, spouseware and - appropriately - creepware. Kaspersky
reports about a million people worldwide are affected by stalkerware every year.
Bear in mind, these are just the cases discovered by one antivirus company. In a
piece of perfect irony, Kaspersky - which is operated through a holding
company in the UK but headquartered in Moscow - reveals Russia to be the
country with the highest levels of stalkerware activity, followed by Brazil and the

US. These countries hold the dubious honour of topping the list in 2021 and
2022.
Here are some examples of how it works, from women who are targeted.
'Amy' becomes worried about her husband knowing where she is all the time. If
she asks him how he knew, he tells her she's 'losing it'. (See: Gaslight.) One day,
he hands over his phone to show her a photo. A pop-up appears: 'Daily report
on Amy's Mac is ready to view.' She quietly excuses herself, checks the
computer, and finds the spyware. Another woman, 'Jessica', says her husband
spies on her through the phone's microphone. He then screws with her head by
repeating back specific phrases she and her friends use in private conversations.
'Amy' and 'Jessica' share their stories with the BBC's cyber-security reporter,
Joe Tidy. During his research, the reporter buys stalkerware and installs it on his
work phone. In the UK, using spyware without someone's permission is illegal.
Nonetheless, the company guides Tidy through how to put the product on his
wife's phone without her knowing. 'The application will start to work in stealth
mode right after installation,' the customer service representative says. 'I'll be
happy to help.'
If you think this phenomenon is new, think again. It's been going on for
years. Researching an article for Forbes back in 2017, journalist Thomas
Brewster calls several suppliers: '... I asked another, what if I didn't get my wife's
permission? "That is okay, she will not know that the software is in the phone,"
the salesperson responded. I moved on to morals. Wasn't it bad to spy on your
wife? "It is not bad. You just want to know the truth," they said.'
One of the more unusual examples of cyberstalking happened in Hobart,
Tasmania. A mechanic working for the Royal Automobile Club of Tasmania
faces court in 2019 for downloading and setting up an app allowing him to
control his ex-girlfriend's car. Not only could he track her movements, he could
suddenly stop the moving vehicle. The man had helped his then-girlfriend to
buy a Land Rover so had access to the VIN, needed to work the app. This
woman works in the field of digital technology, but she only realised what was
occurring when she stumbled upon an email showing maps of her workplace,
including where she parked her car. It's scary stuff.

'As a victim it has caused trauma so deep that it's hard to adequately
describe,' she tells the court. 'These crimes have made me feel unsafe. Made me
fear the technology I once embraced and left me with a deep distrust of the
cybersecurity protections and laws currently in place, now I know they can be
exploited.'
A notebook found at the man's home included the dates of training courses
she'd planned to attend, and the locations of places she'd frequented, as well as a
list of weapons and costings. This case is believed to be a world-first for vehicle
cyberstalking. The man's punishment? A community-based order and a
suspended sentence. Honestly, I despair.
Aside from trauma, one of the long-term psychological impacts of this
treatment is women losing trust in technology: they learn to see it as a weapon.
This deters them from using tech or entering this male-dominated field.
Astonishingly, one in thirteen devices globally is infected with stalkerware,
according to Norton Mobile Security for Android. That's a lot of people -
predominantly women - whose text messages, phone calls and emails are being
monitored without their consent. And here's the kicker: Norton identifies a
dramatic uptick when people are in lockdown, because perpetrators have easy
access to their partner's devices.
Australia's 'infection rate' for stalkerware is around 7 per cent. '... in this
COVID environment, everything we know about family and domestic and
sexual violence has been challenged,' a representative from the not-for-profit
organisation Good Shepherd tells the Standing Committee on Social Policy and
Legal Affairs in late 2020. 'Throughout the pandemic, our practitioners have
seen a link between financial stress, isolation and the onset of new violence.'
Researchers in this country are leading the way in analysing what's now
known as TFA: technology facilitated abuse. A 2021 study by Monash
University finds the majority of victims are women aged up to 34 years, girls 17
and under, and transgender and non-binary people. The main offenders are men
up to 34 years of age, along with boys. Former intimate partners, de facto
partners and spouses are most likely to initiate the abuse in order to intimidate
and cause distress or fear. More than one in three social service workers say

perpetrators insist the victim-survivors share their passwords and provide access
to devices and online accounts.
Over the past decade, Djirra - which provides legal advice to Indigenous
victim-survivors of family violence - witnesses a gradual increase in tech-
facilitated abuse, particularly stalking, extortion and identify theft. 'Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander women are disproportionately more likely to be
targets of online abuse,' CEO of Djirra Antoinette Braybrook tells me. 'Women
with disabilities are particularly vulnerable, as they usually find it even more
difficult to identify this type of abuse and leave violent relationships.'
When they do report abuse, it's not taken seriously by police. 'Our women
experience systemic racism which injects fear,' Braybrook says. 'Too often our
women are not supported. Many women fear their children will be taken away,
due to the history of the Stolen Generations.' It's even harder for women in rural
communities: 'The small population and connectedness makes it even more
unsafe because perpetrators are likely to find out if they break their silence.'
Consequently, Djirra is prioritising work around e-Safety to create culturally
safe, self-determined solutions.
Tech-facilitated abuse engenders 'a sense of omnipresence for victims, feeling
as though they were always watched by the perpetrator', in the words of Asher
Flynn, associate professor of criminology at Monash University. Survivors
become hyper-vigilant, because they no longer feel safe.
Soon they begin to disconnect, restricting their use of technology, limiting
time spent on the phone, and changing their number. Many lose contact with
family and friends, further isolating them. A new report for Australia's National
Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) reveals technology-
facilitated abuse continues to grow, with one in two people being targeted -
predominantly women.
It's worse if you're considered to be in a minority community: This affects
three in four people who are LGBTQI+, two in three Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander peoples, and three in five Australians with disability.
'I was a prisoner,' an anonymous victim-survivor tells the researchers. 'I had
no say in anything. He controlled absolutely everything of my life: what I wore,
what I ate, where I went, how long I was allowed out for, no phone calls after 7

pm, you name it. And it's just like, how could me, someone who has worked for
the biggest [names employer] in the world... be reduced to nothing, like a robot,
basically doing what I was told?'
Robot technology turning someone into a robot. This is nothing short of
chilling.
You'd better sit down for this next bit of information: 99.3 per cent of
frontline workers have clients reporting online abuse. Yep, almost all of them.
Australia's e-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, tells Radio 2SER it's a
way for offenders to 'ratchet back control'. In some quarters, this is called
technology-facilitated coercive control (TFCC). This sort of control 'transcends
fixed borders and boundaries' to quote The Routledge International Handbook
of Violence Studies. As the crime becomes endemic, the United Nations is
redoubling its efforts to combat cyber violence against women. You could say it's
a shadow pandemic. And it's already affecting the next generation.
Children are being used to facilitate tech abuse, especially in post-separation
and shared parenting situations. Alarmingly, kids' phones, tablets and games
consoles are being exploited by offenders to maintain control. Writing about the
ANROWS report in the Sydney Morning Herald in 2022, feminist Jenna Price
shares the story of a man who 'hid a tracker in his daughter's toy frog to find out
where she was [and] also planted a second device in his former partner's car'.
The Queanbeyan man has been jailed. 'In one recent case, the perpetrator was
able to track down the location of his former partner through the use of a shared
Uber account,' Price writes.
It makes me wonder about the ubiquitous Life360 app, which some of our
friends use to keep an eye on their children. Many parents are unknowingly
turning adult supervision into a kind of surveillance. 'We know where our Users
live, work, shop, drive and more,' Life360 boasts in its prospectus. Gee thanks,
Big Brother.
This reminds me of chapter one of George Orwell's book 1984: 'You had to
live - did live, from habit that became instinct - in the assumption that every
sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every moment
scrutinized.' We're inculcating children, tweens and teens into a placid
acceptance of stalkerware. If this makes you feel as mad as hell, you're not alone.

Where on earth are the legal safeguards? And what can we do to protect
ourselves and our children?

VIRTUAL RAPE
'It wasn't sexual assault, but how it made me feel, does that matter?'
Mikaela Jade, CEO and founder of Indigital
It's the mid-1990s, at the peak of camouflage pants and statement T-shirts. I
remember it well after dressing for months like the singer Natalie Imbruglia in
the film clip for 'Torn'. This is a time of third-wave feminism, girl power and sex
positivity led by media-savvy Gen Xers. In Australia, it heralds important
legislation aimed at protecting people online. Using a carriage service to menace,
harass or cause offence can now land you in prison. But it turns out the law isn't
worth the paper it's written on.
Fast forward two decades and I try to use this legislation to stop trolls making
rape and death threats. The burden of proof is extremely high. In my case, the
police knock on the perpetrator's door, based on the IP address, only to be told,
'One of my flatmates was probably using the computer that day'. He might as
well have said, 'The dog ate my misogynist manifesto. Honestly, I'm really a top
bloke.'
The following day, this charming chap creates a new, anonymous handle to
continue the harassment. Neither Facebook nor Twitter is willing to help.
Headquartered in the US, they defend the abusive comments under the banner
of free speech. Exhausted, broken and beaten, I eventually give up the fight.
eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant says the tech companies are in an
'arms race', building products without any safety protections. The platforms'
main motive is profit. This is highlighted by courageous whistleblowers who give
evidence to the US Congress. When Frances Haugen leaves her job at Facebook,
she takes a trove of internal documents. Haugen, who has a degree in computer

engineering and a master's in business from Harvard, tells Congress in 2021:
'The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of
interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook.
And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimise for its own interests, like
making more money.'
One internal study uncovered by Haugen estimates: 'We may action as little
as 3-5 per cent of hate and about six-tenths of 1 per cent of V & I [violence and
incitement] on Facebook despite being the best in the world at it.' I'm reeling
from this information. Nothing is done in more than 99 out of 100 incidents of
violence and incitement. In the fewer than 1 per cent of cases where action is
taken, victim-survivors hit another roadblock due to deficits in law enforcement.
What a disgraceful example of wilful negligence. This brings us back to artificial
intelligence and machine learning: the algorithms are built to promote
engagement above all else.
'What kind of content gets engagement? Cyberhate, that's what,' social
justice journalist Ginger Gorman tells me via email. (I've given up on translation
software by this stage.) 'So if someone is being piled onto, that makes more
advertising dollars for the platforms. It's a fairly simple, if mercenary, formula,'
the author of the 2019 book Troll Hunting says. 'But the outcomes are both
morally bankrupt and devastating.' You cannot overstate the gravity of platforms
- which have bigger user bases than the populations of China and India put
together - behaving like nations with profit as their only motive.
Sadly, when it comes to trolling, anyone in a minority gets targeted in 'far
more vicious and sustained ways', Gorman says. 'For women, these online
attacks are also more violent and sexual than they are against men. Predator trolls
do what I call "minority stacking". So they stack your minorities against you - so
if you're Black, gay and female, for example, good luck staying safe online. You
can't.' Like bullies in the school playground, the trolls target people in
marginalised communities.
These actions can and do result in violence and murder. But there's a more
insidious way of killing people via social media. How many have died from
COVID-19 due to coordinated campaigns by anti-science activists, who take
advantage of the algorithms to spread their poison? The good news is Facebook

is finally cracking down on this misinformation, because of the global pandemic.
The bad news is the metaverse is coming. Hang on to your hats for this
whirlwind.
Meta's grand new project is 'a tightly interconnected set of digital spaces that
lets users escape into a virtual world and the rules of technology are the only
limit'. Given what they know about the prevalence of internet abuse, you'd
expect the safety of women and marginalised communities to be a top-line issue.
So let's look at the development of this 'online utopia'.
Immersive online experiences come in many forms. You might remember
Second Life, which was created way back in 2003. Several years later, women and
girls begin reporting incidents of real-world rape and harassment after spending
time on the multi-media platform. In December 2006 the infamous 'pink penis
attack' occurs during a digital showcase with the world's first 'virtual
millionaire'.
Ailin Graef had agreed to do the 3D interview to discuss the massive property
empire she's building in Second Life. But online enemies hack into the site,
attacking her cyber-character with flying penises.
Similar events are occurring in testing for the next stage of the metaverse,
which will host a billion people within a decade, if you believe Mark
Zuckerberg's 2022 claims.
Associate Professor Ellen Broad, author of the 2018 book Made by Humans:
the AI Condition, is a member of the Australian government's Data Advisory
Council. In an article for Harper's Bazaar, she says no one seems to have learned
from the Second Life incidents. 'In early 2022, a female beta tester for Meta's
social metaverse, Horizon Worlds, described being virtually groped by another
user of the platform while others watched,' Broad writes.
She also shares with the magazine the story of a journalist who spends two
weeks as a digital avatar encountering 'a range of creepy, uninvited encounters',
like being surrounded by silent male avatars taking photos of her without asking.
'On one platform, a male avatar followed her around saying she was pretty,'
Broad writes. 'On others, users shouted random obscenities and made animal
noises.'

In response to such issues, Meta announces a new feature called 'personal
boundary' setting. This builds an invisible wall around a person's avatar,
preventing unsolicited virtual touching. While this is welcome, it doesn't go far
enough. By way of example, Broad writes about a TEDxCanberra talk by
Cabrogal woman Mikaela Jade, founder and CEO of Indigital.
Jade describes presenting at a 2021 conference as a holographic avatar. At one
stage she looks down to see the system is placing her colleague's holographic
head in her physical crotch. 'As a woman who's been sexually assaulted, I can't
tell you the shame and embarrassment that I experienced seeing his head there,'
Jade says. 'It wasn't sexual assault, but how it made me feel, does that matter?'
These anecdotes highlight problems with the technology. However, they
come from society's attitudes towards women in the physical world. One in five
Australians think women who say they were abused often make up or exaggerate
their claims, according to a study by the Global Institute for Women's
Leadership in 2022. Three in 10 men hold this view. We've come a long way, but
we have a long way to go.
Instead of stepping back from the metaverse until it's safe, Big Tech is forging
forward. Australia's Company Director magazine reports in 2022 that staff at
Accenture already 'attend their meetings in the metaverse', dealing with each
other as avatars. Figures from McKinsey & Company, quoted in the magazine,
reveal 63 per cent of companies that are 'metaverse adopters' are training their
employees in this virtual space, rather than face-to-face.
3D immersive experiences are exploding in the conference and events
industry, opening the door for more 'holographic assaults' similar to the attack
on Mikaela Jade. As a victim-survivor of sexual assault, I feel frightened about
continuing to give keynote speeches under these conditions. This is further
silencing women.
During the height of lockdowns, Zoombombing - in which trolls interrupt
work or school video calls to show pornography - leads to serious concerns. In
2021, Zoom's founder says, 'We never thought about that [as a possible
outcome].' I wonder why? Perhaps it has something to do with the lack of
diversity in the tech sector. 'The people constructing metaverses today are
overwhelmingly white, male and able-bodied, who also tend to experience

attention as something that's typically positive, or at least benign,' Ellen Broad
writes. Of course they're going to build online communities based on attracting
attention.
Jeez. It appears we're not even safe in the 'utopia' of the future.
At last, governments are pressuring Big Tech to implement responsible safety
reforms. But the 'bad actors' are refusing to adapt. Instead, they're moving to
the seedy side of town, migrating to platforms like Reddit, 4Chan, Parler and
Telegram. My teenage son, Taj, reckons Reddit's 'not all bad', but let's face it:
this network is home to some shocking bigotry and misogyny. The clue is in the
tagline: 'Dive into anything.'
Ginger Gorman and other advocates want countries to legislate duty of care
provisions to force all platforms to keep people safe. At the moment, the
bandaid solution is telling women to get off their phones, which is effectively
blaming the victim. A phone may be a woman's only lifeline, or simply an
indispensable business tool.
In fact, this technology can be used to combat domestic and family violence.
Thailand's MySis Bot offers information to victim-survivors 24 hours a day
through Facebook Messenger. In Brazil, MAIA (My AI Friend) allows women
to discuss violence online confidentially, without judgement. The app doesn't
ask for identifiable or personal information, and the contents of the chat won't
be stored. In South Africa, rAInbow - an AI smart companion for victim-
survivors - facilitates more than 150,000 conversations during a period of three
months.
In 2020, stalking victim-survivor and entrepreneur Ritika Dutt relies on her
knowledge of artificial intelligence to create a tool to assist fellow Canadians to
disclose crimes, understand their legal rights and connect with support
organisations. Her free web app, Botler for Citizens, analyses the information to
determine what laws are being violated. It also generates incident reports to be
forwarded to authorities. The app uses bank-level encryption.
Not all apps are this safe. The policy for MySis Bot indicates personal data
can be collected and accessed by the team which works with women
experiencing violence. The data might be used for research, leaving it vulnerable

to hacking. This raises concerns that the apps being built to help people could
do more harm than good.
In the UK, security and policy expert at IBM Lesley Nuttall leads a team
trying to shift the onus of safety away from the end-user. Their
recommendations include promoting diversity in development, informing users
when someone accesses their data or location and notifying them when changes
are made to their account. Of course, the gold standard response is always 'real
world' support workers, rather than chatbots.
Elsewhere, algorithms are being applied to the contentious area of predictive
policing. Back in 1998, I travelled to Bangladesh to film a documentary on the
abuse of women and girls after natural disasters - notably, the annual
monsoons. Now, we're seeing history repeat with a rise in the rates of domestic
violence and sexual assault during another disaster: the global pandemic. After
gathering data from more than 500 families, in 2021 academics from
Bangladesh, Italy and Ireland use machine learning to identify correlations
between domestic violence and environmental, demographic and social factors.
They claim to be able to predict family violence in Bangladesh with a 62-77 per
cent degree of accuracy.1
This idea is gaining credence. In 2020 almost 2000 Israeli tech workers,
backed by Facebook, Microsoft, Salesforce and other tech giants, spend three
days brainstorming apps, platforms and services designed to counter domestic
violence. The ten leading startups are in accelerator programs, where each
product will continue to be developed.2
While it would be lifesaving to stop the problem before it begins, I wonder
whether we should let artificial intelligence predict such incidents. Where does
the accountability lie if the robot gets it wrong? What about the inviolable tenet
of privacy for all citizens? And who's to blame if there's a damaging data breach?
Aspects of this are reminiscent of phrenology and the COMPAS technology,
which predicts who'll become a criminal. But something proactive needs to be
done. Offenders are becoming bolder, enabled by the relentless march of
technology.
A case in point is the stalking and harassment of a woman in Florida. Ali
Borja, a computer science professor at the University of Central Florida, sends

more than 800 messages a day to a woman he'd initially offered to tutor. Borja
says he wants to make an 'artificial intelligence' - a sex robot - of her, so he
'could do anything he wanted'. It seems the future is already here: welcome to
the world of sexbots.

SEXBOTS
'Listen doll, I believe robots exist to free humanity from the soulless grind of
manual labor, to act as a faithful companion in the conquest of space, and to serve
as a politically incorrect slave substitute - not the pornographic fantasy of geeky
science fiction readers!'
'But I have been programmed with over six million pornographic fantasies,' purred
the sensual sexeroid, the subsonics of her voice sending erotic vibrations through
Proton's nether regions. 'I was created in Man's image of the ideal woman. No
Servus droid may harm the male ego or, through omission of action, allow that ego
to be harmed.'
Plan 9 from Outer Space, cult 1957 science fiction film
From Roxxxy to Frigid Farrah, Wild Wendy and S&M Susan, female robots have
a history of being sexualised. In fact, the first sexbot - produced by a British
company in the late 1970s - is only known by her chest measurement. In case
you're wondering, it's 36C. I guess this is what you expect from a company
called Sex Objects Ltd. You can almost see the handlebar moustaches and hear
the porno bass. Incidentally, the teens tell me the 'pornstache' is back in, which
would explain the young Tom Sellecks and Pedro Pascals I keep seeing out on the
town.
In 1983, a big-breasted female robot named Sweetheart is removed from
display at the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley, California. This follows the
circulation of a petition claiming the sexbot is insulting to women. Go, you
fabulous second-wave feminists! Its designer, Professor Clayton Bailey, responds
by crying 'censorship!' like a big baby. Seriously Clay, this isn't Nuremberg. But
the 'good professor' doesn't stop there.

Bailey continues to wax lyrical about his creation. 'It's the world's most
beautiful lady robot,' he tells New Scientist magazine. 'To ban this would be like
banning Venus de Milo.' Bear in mind Sweetheart has baseball bat legs, a coffee
urn as a torso and vacuum cleaner arms. I'm not sure how an ancient Greek
sculpture displayed at the Louvre can be compared with a big, busty coffee pot.
But to each their own, beauty being in the eye of the beholder. Or cupholder, in
this instance.
Since that time, new terms enter the lexicon: digisexuals and robosexuals.
Digisexuals are people who view sex tech as an essential part of who they are;
often, they forgo relationships with other humans. It's theorised people who
fetishise sexbots are seeking passive women who won't question their requests.
Perhaps they haven't seen the 1927 science fiction masterpiece Metropolis,
starring a beautiful and wildly sadistic female robot. 'Maria' functions to secure,
corrupt and destroy - until she's burned at the stake. It's fascinating how
women - and robots in female form - end up being punished as witches.
Seriously, sex with robots raises the issue of consent. Even if they're
programmed with the ability to refuse sex, the entire idea still stinks of rape
culture. Intercourse with fembots represents the 'rape of a woman' and may
increase the rate of rape in society, while also facilitating a general 'disrespect for
women' in society, according to Professor Robert Sparrow from Monash
University in his 2017 paper, 'Robots, Rape, and Representation'.1
However, to play devil's advocate, if sex robots aren't human and can't feel
emotions, is consent really relevant? To take this argument further, could robots
actually educate people on how to have sex? Imagine if her operation improved
when asked questions such as, 'Do you like that?' or 'How about this?'
There's a PhD in whether robots will become sentient within our lifetimes,
but that's not what this book is about. Great works of fiction, like Klara and the
Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro and Machines Like Me by Ian McEwan, cover this area
adeptly. My interest lies in the debate around offenders raping robots rather than
real people. Academics are split on whether this would simply act as an
encouragement to rapists.
I tend to agree with Laura Bates, author of the 2014 book Everyday Sexism:
'We should no more be encouraging rapists to find a supposedly safe outlet for it

than we should facilitate murderers by giving them realistic, blood-spurting
dummies to stab.' Touché.
With this in mind, let's look at how our robot sisters are being treated around
the world. You're about to meet a strange cast of characters, including the
delightful Brick Dollbanger. Apparently, this is not his real name.
The first sex robot powered by artificial intelligence makes her illustrious
debut in 2010 at the Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas. Think Austin
Powers fembots, without the machine gun breasts. While Roxxxy is anatomically
correct, she is unable to move. Her unique selling point? Five distinct
personalities to help her interact with her 'master'. These include Frigid Farrah,
Wild Wendy and Mature Martha. Slow clap for sexual stereotyping. Extra marks
for alliteration. Perhaps the most inappropriate personality is Young Yoko, who
at barely 18 is 'oh so young and waiting for you to teach her'. Ew.
The reporter covering the sexbot launch for Tech News World, Renay San
Miguel, seems swept away by this sexdroid's charms: 'She will also be able to talk,
listen, carry on a conversation, feel your touch and be your true friend. She can
also have an orgasm when you touch her!' He really hits his stride midway
through the article. 'Roxxxy is a downloadable sexbot, a WiFi-enabled wanton
woman who may single-handedly redefine the phrase "hot spot",' he writes.
What this puff piece doesn't tell you is that an owner can rape Roxxxy with a
simple switch in settings. According to the website True Companion, Roxxxy is
simply reluctant - like someone being reluctant to kiss on the first date.
Honestly, some of these roboticists need a lesson in the definition of consent.
A few years later, the debate begins in earnest. 'I believe that loving sex robots
will be a great boon to society... There are millions of people out there who, for
one reason or another, cannot establish good relationships,' the author of Love
and Sex with Robots, David Levy, tells Newsweek. In response, a group of
academics in Sweden and the UK create the Campaign Against Sex Robots,
arguing they're harmful and demeaning. Using feminist ethical dialogues, they
rail against deepfakes, virtual reality porn and the 'dollification' of women and
girls.
This prompts the Japanese company SoftBank, which is responsible for the
semi-humanoid Pepper, to slap a ban on robot sex. The user agreement states

this: 'The policy owner must not perform any sexual act or other indecent
behaviour.' The trend in Japan is to create slender and graceful female robots,
which either maintain traditional family structures or provide personal
intimacy: servile or sexual.
Do I hear someone say 'madonna-whore dichotomy'? Actroid, designed by
Hiroshi Ishiguro at Osaka University, is supposed to be the perfect secretary:
smiling, amenable and a little flirtatious. And Project Aiko aims to produce a
realistic-looking female robot, with sensitivity sensors in the breasts and genitals
to facilitate a sexual response.
Recent years are seeing significant advances in this technology. Users can now
customise a robot called Harmony by using a mobile app, with thousands of
combinations of clothes, personalities and voices. RealDollX allows owners to
'design' the shape and colour of the doll's vulva. For the fussy consumer, there
are 11 styles of vaginal insert.
To satisfy an unusual inclination, one addition is elf ears. I can see the sales
pitch now: 'Ever dreamed of making love to Lady Galadriel from The Lord of the
Rings? Well, your dream has become a reality. Buy your own sexy Elf Queen
here!' I wonder what Cate Blanchett thinks about one of her most famous
characters becoming a life-sized sex toy?
These dolls are also programmed to react with appropriate vocalisations
when they're penetrated, intensifying as they progress from mild arousal to
orgasm. I'm assuming they have the ability to fake, rather like Meg Ryan's
character in the iconic film When Harry Met Sally. Some feminists celebrate
this. Quoting the works of legendary author and activist, bell hooks, they draw a
line between erotic attraction and love. 'The introduction of sex robots simply
means that the object of many men's confused projections may become robots
instead of women,' the author of Sensuous Knowledge, Minna Salami, writes in
her blog, MsAfropolitan. 'That is not a loss to mourn!'
There's even a school of thought that male sex robots could enhance women's
safety. Due to the risk of violence, some heterosexual women fear experimenting
sexually. A robot could be a safe option. I'm starting to think it could be fun to
program a bot to stimulate the optimal orgasm. A lot less tiring than
masturbating, I assume.

Looking at this through the lens of civil liberties, surely everybody has the
right to safe and satisfying sex. For those without a partner, sexbots provide
much-needed physical intimacy. 'First-wave sexual technology, like dating and
messaging apps, and social networks, are making way for the second wave of
virtual reality and sex robots,' Professor of Philosophy Neil McArthur writes in
his 2022 essay, 'Sex and Technology: The Ethics of Virtual Connection'. Perhaps
the benefits do outweigh the disadvantages.
While the overwhelming majority of sexbots are being created in the female
form, there are notable exceptions to the ongoing objectification of women.
'Coming Soon: Henry, The Self-Lubricating Gay Male Sex Robot', Star
Observer magazine announces in 2021. Henry, which is being developed by AI
robotics company RealDoll, will be able to be programmed as either gay or
straight.
Harmony, with an animatronic head and Scottish accent, has a 'bisexual
flavour', according to the press release. The company is also planning to release
lesbian sex robots. Of course, these dolls look like a male fantasy of lesbians,
boasting enormous boobs, long hair and enhanced lips. See: mainstream movies.
All these creations will have 'self-heating, self-lubricating erogenous zones'.
Personally, I think self-cleaning would be a terrific option. You see, Henry is
being developed with a 'bionic penis'. (So THAT'S what The Six Million Dollar
Man has under his tight-fitting pants.) 'We're going to be working on some sort
of very special insert for Henry so that he's able to, you know, lift trucks with his
penis or something,' CEO of RealDoll subdivision Realbotix, Matt McMullen,
tells PinkNews. Here's hoping it doesn't cost $6 million. While this is rather
amusing, there is one - ahem - large hurdle to overcome. Trigger warning: this
might make you wince.
'When can a body be animated, and then be safe to throw into someone's
bed?' McMullen asks. 'A robotic arm that's strong enough to lift the entirety of
its silicone weight is pretty darn strong. If something goes a little bit off with
that, it can take your head off.' One episode of The Big Bang Theory centres on
Howard borrowing a robotic arm from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. First he
uses it as a massager, before trying to pleasure himself. Howard's genitals become
stuck and he ends up in the emergency ward.

Now I don't know about you, but I'd rather not be remembered as the
person who's maimed during sex with a robot. No matter how good that bionic
penis is.
Like it or not, our sexual tastes are becoming more digitised. And I'm not
talking about fingering. Four of the most trafficked websites in the world are
pornographic. The biggest site, Pornhub, attracts more eyeballs than Netflix. Sex
tech is a US$30 billion industry, boosted in part by the pandemic.
Financial discretion is hindering a thorough internal analysis of its impact on
broader society. Most companies will not admit to problems with their artificial
intelligence because of intense competition. They're all in a race to the first
billion. Also, it's an icky topic. 'We can't say whether they'll be harmful or
helpful without more rigorous studies,' founder of the SxTech EU conference,
Ola Miedzynska, says. 'Academics are keeping their eyes closed.'
Interestingly, Australia is home to several researchers doing groundbreaking
work in sex tech. Future-forward academics from Monash University in
Melbourne are behind one of the first empirical studies to examine the
psychology of our receptiveness to sex robots, aiming to 'provide relevant
government and industry bodies with a better understanding of this important
topic for more informed policy making'. Recent international papers focus on
robots as a way to enhance sexuality for elderly people and those living with
disabilities.
But these benefits can't be realised while there are ethical, legal and regulatory
challenges. In the US, it's against the law to import and transport any
'anatomically correct doll, mannequin, or robot, with the features of, or with
features that resemble those of, a minor, intended for use in sexual acts'. This is
known colloquially as the 'CREEPER Act'. Appropriate, really.
Here, regulation of childlike sex dolls and robots is being addressed
proactively by the Commonwealth, South Australia and Queensland. These
statutory provisions may guide any future regulation of adult sexbots. The
penalties are stiff: a maximum of ten years in jail for importation and 15 years for
possession. Producing such a doll in Australia means 20 years imprisonment.
Hundreds of childlike sex dolls are seized by Border Force every year. Such
crimes also come under the remit of the Australian Federal Police.

'These dolls are far from harmless,' AFP Acting Sergeant Kevin Shaw says in
a media release. 'The evidence is clear that the dolls are not used as a substitute
for offending against real children but in fact contribute to increased offending
against children.'
However, when these cases come to court, traditionally they're deemed to be
a step removed from 'the possession of material that depicts real children'.
Consequently, sentences are generally light. This is changing in line with a
precedent set in South Australia in late 2021 when a 32-year-old man is
sentenced to three years in prison for importing and possessing a child sex doll.
Children and adults alike are vulnerable to exploitation in the sex industry. In
Europe, experimental cyber-brothels are disrupting the sector. 'Experience two
dolls in doggy and missionary position hanging in love swings,' urges Cybrothel
of Berlin. Not quite sure how this works, but I'm reticent to search Google
images. For now, the sex dolls are connected to an external control room where
humans direct their actions and provide vocal responses. This is basically
analogue artificial intelligence. Is it possible governments could one day license
cyber-brothels, while banning human sex work?
In the dystopian TV series Westworld, bordello madam Maeve Millay and
her fellow hosts attend to every desire of the theme park's guests. Spoiler alert:
they eventually become sentient and rise up to kill everyone. Good for them! In
the real world, a study by the Foundation for Responsible Robotics finds there's
a market for sex doll prostitutes, but no evidence they'd replace human sex
workers or reduce sex trafficking.
It really is wonderful to live in a world where sensible people start up
foundations like this to protect us all. While the report reveals interest in using
sex robots for services to people with disabilities or the elderly, there remain
ethical concerns around the capacity to consent to intercourse with a robot. Like
the #MeToo movement, this conversation needs to be centred in consent.
A deeper issue is the tech sector's habit of moving fast and breaking things.
This development mantra, popularised when Meta was Facebook, is used by
most tech companies as a way of delivering 'value' quickly. Surely safeguards
should be put in place before a product is unleashed on the unsuspecting public?

Fortunately, proactive programs are underway to add empathy to this fraught
field. Dr Angelica Lim, the former head of the Emotional and Expressivity teams
for the Pepper humanoid project at SoftBank, is developing robots that have the
capacity for compassion. The name of her lab? ROSIE. Dr Lim runs a two-week
summer enrichment program for girls through AI4All, dubbed Invent the
Future.
Now, we need to add a liberal dose of compassion - and consent - to the
disturbing world of deepfakes.

DEEPFAKES
'Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.'
George Orwell, 1984
Pssst! Wanna see a naked lady? Well, you're in luck. The internet's full of 'em! In
fact, there are so many images of under-dressed women online, our machine
overlords learn this is our usual state. I don't know about you, but at the very
least I try to cover my bum and boobs before leaving the house. However, I'm 55
and it's a brave new world out there. The Kardashians seem to be the new
'soma', a drug to distract us from the horrors of the world. Maybe I'm being
churlish, but I find the gender disparity online especially enraging.
Here's an example of how societal biases are baked into algorithms. In 2021,
researchers decide to do an experiment, feeding pictures of a man cropped below
the neck into an image-generation algorithm. To clarify, the picture is cropped
below the neck, not the actual man. That would be rather painful and probably
fatal. More than 40 per cent of the time, the robot auto-completes the image by
dressing the lucky chap in a nice suit.
When they put photos of a woman into the same algorithm, more than half
of the time it dresses her in a low-cut top or bikini. One of the photos they give
to the machine features Democrat congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Sure enough, the internationally renowned politician ends up wearing a bikini.
The culprit this time is deepfake, a more sophisticated version of Photoshop.
Deepfakes are images generated by artificial intelligence that map one of your
body parts - normally the face - then superimpose it onto someone else's body.
Alternatively, you could stumble upon a picture of yourself in an entirely

conflated situation. Say, as part of Vladimir Putin's Politburo 2.0, or engaging in
group sex with a boy band.
This type of fakery requires smart software and a deep dive into the data. But
this doesn't mean it takes a genius. There are countless apps, like China's Zao,
that do it within seconds, allowing two people to switch faces. SpeakPic takes
this further, with users able to make their photos speak.
The plight of politicians is well documented. Remember the infamous public
service announcement by Barack Obama? American comedian Jordan Peele and
Buzzfeed employ artificial intelligence to create a fake Barack, who calls Donald
Trump a 'total and complete dipshit'. Now, I'm happy to support 'fake news'
when it tells the truth. But we know sophisticated deepfakes are a threat to
global democracy.
In March 2022, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine enters its third week,
video footage is played on social media and broadcast on the TV channel
Ukraine 24. It appears to show Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy
instructing citizens to stop fighting Russian soldiers and surrender their
weapons. In this case, Zelenskyy debunks the video and it's removed from
Facebook and YouTube, but in an increasingly siloed world, replete with
confirmation bias, deepfakes pose a threat. This is most obvious in the political
sphere.
However, a more common use often flies under the radar. Believe it or not,
96 per cent of deepfakes are pornographic, according to a 2019 study by the US
AI firm Sensity. Almost all instances are nonconsensual. And the number of
deepfake porn clips is doubling every six months. When the imitation is so close
to the real thing, the damage is akin to someone sharing your intimate videos
without consent. This is a violation of our bodies.
'When pornography is of us, our consent is required for its production to be
permissible,' Australian academic Dr Claire Benn writes in a paper given at the
Australian National University's 2022 Law and Philosophy Forum. 'Whenever
the person depicted does not consent (or in the case of a child, can't consent),
that person is wronged by the creation of deepfake pornography and has a claim
against its production.'1

Deepfakes are one method of committing what used to be called 'revenge
porn'. Julie Inman Grant, Australia's eSafety Commissioner, prefers the term
'image-based abuse', because revenge porn suggests the victim has done
something wrong. She stresses the seriousness of the lexicon, noting child sexual
abuse was formerly referred to as 'kiddie porn'. Inman Grant talks frequently
about how deepfake is becoming weaponised. Anyone can steal a holiday shot or
Insta selfie to use in pornographic images or films.
Open-source code DeepNude allows perpetrators to strip the clothes from
photos of women. After paying US$50, the user uploads a photo of a fully
clothed woman, which comes back naked. Fun fact: DeepNude doesn't work on
men. The software uses generative adversarial networks, or GANs. Yikes! Too
many tech words. This is a kind of machine learning which is wholly
unsupervised. Two computer systems known as 'neural networks' are pitted
against each other to construct synthetic data that can pass for the real thing. In
other words, 'robots gone wild'.
The Sensity study of deepfake imagery uncovers at least 100,000 victims,
including children. This is becoming the next pandemic - a veritable epidemic
of abuse. A stark warning comes from close to home: Dr Richard Nock,
Machine Learning Group Leader at CSIRO's Data61. He says artificial
intelligence can accelerate both scientific breakthroughs and malicious
technologies. 'We're seeing an arms race around deepfakes,' he tells the website
InnovationAus in 2019.
The effect on women in particular is devastating. Some have to change their
names. Others remove themselves from the internet. Shockingly, several end up
taking their own lives. Of course, weaponised face swaps target famous women,
like Scarlett Johansson and Gal Gadot. But people who aren't well known are
increasingly being subjected to involuntary pornography.
In 2019, Helen Mort, an English writer, discovers deepfake images of herself
on a porn site: they'd been online for two years. She still doesn't know who
posted them, and seems to have no recourse under the law, telling the BBC: 'The
police couldn't help me, because in England it's not an offence to manipulate
the images in that way.' Mort writes and recites an online poem about her
experience.

This is my gf, Helen. She's amazing. I love her deeply.
I want to see her used hard, abused, and broken sexually.
What's the dirtiest thing she'd do? Tell me.
There are some great ideas in my galleries!
She talks about how innocent images were stolen and sexualised:
Here I'm grinning from a frame of blue, Ibizan sky.
Here is a woman with two men between her thighs.
Here I'm on holiday, freckled and sun flecked.
Here is a man with his hands around my neck.
Here I'm pregnant with my son.
Here is a body overrun.
And how she has to reclaim her identity:
Outside it snows and snow reclaims the lawn.
Day reclaims sky. Sky reclaims dawn.
Here is Helen walking to her son's nursery.
Here is Helen on her first anniversary.
Then comes the evening talking its cue,
the sound of history forgetting you.2
This is occurring around the world. In India in 2018, journalist Rana Ayyub
is admitted to hospital after a deepfake attack. Ayyub had planned to speak to
the media about an eight-year-old girl who'd been raped. She soon becomes
aware of tweets coming from her account that she'd neither written nor posted.
Later, she receives a link to a faked pornographic video, shared more than
40,000 times on social media. Ayyub goes from being an outspoken journalist to
'self-censoring', she writes in the Huffington Post. There's no legislation to help
her, nor any effort to curb the abuse. While this can easily happen using
photoshop, deepfake takes an attack to the next level.
In 2022, there's a devastating case of photoshop abuse that could easily be
replicated through deepfake. Sixteen-year-old Basant Khaled, from Kafr El Zayat

village in Egypt, refuses to go out on a date with a classmate. In response, he
collaborates with another classmate to create fake photos, tries to blackmail her,
then publishes the photos online.
Devastated, Basant dies by suicide, leaving a note for her mother: 'Mom,
believe me, the girl in those pictures is not me. These pictures were
photoshopped. I swear! I'm a young girl, mom, and I don't deserve all that's
happening to me. I'm suffering from depression, and I feel like I'm suffocating.
I'm really tired. It's not me, you raise me well.'
There's no Egyptian law covering deepfake pornography.
One Australian victim-survivor campaigning against this abuse is Noelle
Martin. Now a lawyer, Martin was first targeted by deepfake imagery when she
was 17 years old. In 2022 she tells the parliamentary Inquiry into Social Media
and Online Safety that proposed laws to hold social media companies to account
are 'utterly inaccessible'. Martin dismisses the financial penalties as 'chump
change' that won't result in meaningful reform.
Around the same time in the US, Florida State Senator Lauren Book speaks
about a man stealing non-sexual nude photos of her and altering them to create
deepfakes, which were then sold online. He tried to extort US$5000 to stop the
release of the images. This crime is known as 'sextortion'.
'My life of public service has resulted in private terror,' she tells a committee
hearing in Tallahassee. As a result of her experience, Senator Book sponsors a bill
to make buying, selling or trading stolen intimate images a felony. It also suggests
a criminal offence of disseminating altered or created sexually explicit images
known as deepfakes. The bill is passed unanimously.
While these initiatives are steps in the right direction, the laws remain behind
the times. Attempting to change legislation is like swimming through mud. In
2018, US Senator Mark Warner proposes to penalise social media companies
allowing sharing of deepfake documents. A task force is set up, but four years
later there's still no federal legislation. Some states in the US, frustrated by the
glacial pace of change, pass their own laws.
In Australia, revenge porn is now a crime. China is on board, unveiling a
draft bill to ban these technologies from being used to 'endanger national
security, undermine social stability, disrupt social order, or violate the lawful

rights and interests of others'. It also bans deepfake pornography. In the UK, the
Domestic Abuse Act includes a sentence of up to two years in jail for those who
threaten 'to disclose intimate images with the intention to cause distress'.
Some argue defamation law could be a recourse. But this raises the patriarchal
notion that it's wrong for women to be overtly sexual. Running a defamation
case supports the contention that pornographic content is always damaging to
women's reputations, regardless of consent. Woe betide the woman who makes a
living in the pornography industry but is deepfaked into content to which she
doesn't consent. It would be hard for her to claim she's defamed by sexually
explicit material.
Clearly, defamation is not a suitable means of defence. What about copyright
law? In many jurisdictions, this would be thrown out under the 'fair use'
provision. In one of his music videos, the rapper Kendrick Lamar morphs into
Will Smith, OJ Simpson and Kanye West, among others. It seems the use of
deepfakes doesn't violate copyright law - for now.
Interestingly, the European Parliament is taking action by modifying the
Digital Service Act to cover the dissemination of deepfakes. But these laws don't
address the concerns of campaigners about the use of deepfake technology to
recast pornographic videos.
Dare I say it - enter late-stage capitalism. Legislators are cautious about
bringing out the big stick because the European Union and the US don't want
to hamstring the emerging AI sector.
Advertising companies, for example, want to create deepfakes for commercial
purposes, including the lucrative film industry. Or music videos, like The Heart
Part 5 by Lamar. Whenever you see lawmakers moving slowly on an issue, follow
the money to find out who really holds the power.
The tech companies are starting to self-regulate, to stymie moves towards
legislation. Gee, we all know how well that works in the tobacco industry!
Project Origin - a collaboration between Microsoft and media organisations in
the UK - is developing programs that will recognise manipulated content. A
cryptographic algorithm can be used to put 'hashes' at certain intervals during
videos. No, this isn't a mind-altering cookie or brownie.

Rather, a hash is a way of converting letters or numbers into encrypted data.
If the video's altered, the hashes will change. Facebook is committing to
removing all videos that 'had been edited in ways that weren't obvious to an
average person, or if they misled a viewer into thinking that a person in a video
said words they did not actually say'. And TikTok has instituted a similar policy.
Like any form of technology, deepfake isn't all bad. Technologists in Israel are
using it to give voice to victims of domestic violence after death. Listen To Our
Voices is a response to the global and local surge in domestic and family abuse
since the start of the pandemic. 'I was Michal Sela,' a voice rings out in the
haunting clip. 'In 2019, I was murdered by the man who was my husband.
Today, I call on you, listen to my voice.'
The video, featuring the faces of five Israeli women, goes viral in an eerie
social media campaign. Israeli startup D-ID utilises artificial intelligence and
animation to create realistic facial features and gestures, as the women describe
the verbal and physical assaults inflicted by their partners. They encourage other
women to talk to experts before it's too late.
Another project undertaken by D-ID is called Deep Nostalgia. This is quite
unsettling. The system animates photos of dead loved ones, like a scene from a
Harry Potter film. Old portraits become blinking and smiling videos. Your
Aunty Maude or Uncle Eric is back from the grave! There's a touch of Norma
Bates about this technology, I reckon. Genealogy company My Heritage is aware
of the disturbing nature of the tech, noting it won't add speech features. 'While
many love the Deep Nostalgia feature and consider it magical, others find it
uncanny and are uncomfortable with the results,' the company writes on its
website.
During the pandemic, online fraud using deepfake accelerates exponentially.
In fact, there's a new term for this: Frankenstein fraud. Criminals combine
genuine and falsified information - data, images and videos - to try to rip you
off. The synthetic identity comes to life during 'onboarding', which is the initial
interaction between you and a business. The average amount stolen by synthetic
fraud is more than A$140,000.
As artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated, it's not only threatening
our bank accounts. This technology is targeting our children.

CHILDCARE ROBOTS
'I'm watching over you, even when you are sleeping.'
Vevo, childcare robot
It's 2050 and the childcare business is booming. Society is moving beyond the
debate about inadequate wages, poor conditions and the exploitation of a
predominantly female workforce. Every parent outsources their childcare to
robots in AI-supervised centres. Many only see their progeny on weekends and
holidays. The care bots look after your child's every need, from feeding to
playing and educating. This enables workers to be truly productive without the
annoying encumbrance of family. It really is a utopia! (Stirring music rises in the
background.)
This scenario might seem far-fetched, but children are considered a 'product'
primed for optimisation by artificial intelligence. Perhaps this is nothing new:
every stage of a child's life is accompanied by an insidious sales pitch designed to
play on parental insecurity. Trouble getting toddlers to sleep? Purchase this state-
of-the-art $2000 air purifier! Six-year-old struggling at school? Subscribe to our
online reading program. Tween skin troubles? Try our new Healthy Glow range
of organic skincare.
Childcare enabled by artificial intelligence is simply something else served on
a platter to perfectionist parents. I'm as guilty as anyone, always outsourcing. In
a glass half-empty version of this future, the parental bond becomes broken,
children struggle to relate to their peers and humans slowly turn into
automatons.
Like any large-scale change, this begins with small steps. The history of the
electrical baby supervisor can be traced back to the Bakelite Zenith Radio Nurse

in 1938. It's created by the president of Zenith Electronics, Eugene McDonald
Jr, who's worried about his daughter's safety in the wake of the Lindbergh baby
kidnapping. A transmitter is installed in a child's bedroom while the receiver is
placed near the parents.
Fast forward to 1997 and the adorable PaPeRo is launched in Japan. The
Partner-type-Personal-Robot interacts with children while parents are out of the
house. You can direct the device to find the kids any time, anywhere, like a
cyborg stalker. The year 2017 gives birth to a child-sized robot called iPal, which
can play, sing and dance with children while live-streaming videos to the parents.
The aim is to engage children for three to eight hours without human
supervision.
By 2022, this assistance is insidious. Bosco is a mobile app that analyses a
child's behaviour and 'predicts and prevents threats' coming in via their mobile
phone; BeanQ is a tiny AI-powered robot which answers questions, takes photos
and keeps the child busy while the parents are otherwise occupied. Millions of
households in China have the latter, which builds a detailed life profile through
everyday interactions: In other words, it's constantly spying on your kids.
Aside from the obvious privacy concerns, these devices can lead to 'paralysis
by analysis'. Parents become over-reliant on technology when making decisions
about their offspring. But it's a lot more complicated than reading a copy of the
latest parenting tome. Overwhelmed, they may fail to make decisions at all,
leaving everything to the robots. Already, there are plenty of days when I want to
rock slowly in the corner in a foetal position, due to an inability to properly
parent the teens.
But that's not the worst outcome. Robots may harm our children. Consider
the 2022 story of a bot crushing the finger of a 7 year old during a Russian chess
match. I'm not making this up. Moscow Chess Federation members say the boy
was 'too quick to make his move'. Apparently, the child is at fault. CCTV
footage shows the robot grabbing the finger and breaking it, before adults rush
in to help. The child finishes the tournament the next day in a cast.
'Nothing serious happened,' Moscow Chess Federation's vice-president,
Sergey Smagin, tells RIA Novosti news agency in an uncanny imitation of police
chief Frank Drebin in The Naked Gun: 'Nothing to see here. Move along!' To

add insult to injury, Smagin blames the boy: 'There are certain safety rules and
the child, apparently, violated them. When he made a move, he didn't notice
that he had to wait.' How dare he commit such a heinous crime!
What could happen when robots start to replace parents? Could children die
under their 'care'? And who'd be held responsible? Perhaps the most disturbing
development is a bot by the name of VEVO. In 2009, Gunma University in
Japan introduces a childcare robot with facial recognition software so it can greet
people individually. VEVO monitors children's vital signs; an alarm alerts
parents to any unusual activity.
In a hair-raising video released in 2021, VEVO sounds a little like a
paedophile: 'I'm watching over you, even when you are sleeping.' Artificial
intelligence expert Michelle Tempest - who's also a former doctor in the UK's
National Health Service - predicts that by 2050, parenting will be as 'obsolete as
floppy discs'. The author of Big Brain Revolution: Artificial Intelligence - Spy or
Saviour? says robots will end up raising one in three children.
You'll even be able to transfer your foetus to a robotic uterus. Yes, I know it
sounds odd. But to the ears of people in the 1800s, the words 'embryo transfer'
would have sounded strange. My partner, Jason, and I would probably be
childless without advances in medical science - specifically, successful IVF
treatment. I understand the attraction of 'outsourcing' this process to
mechanical intervention if the original equipment is somehow faulty. Dr
Tempest foresees purpose-built 'Upbringing Centres', in which children will
interact almost exclusively with digital avatars and automatons that combine the
roles of nurse, nanny, teacher and therapist.
'Mums and dads will, in effect, have the option of becoming holiday parents,
who need only to spend time with their children on day trips and family
vacations,' she tells The London Economic newspaper. In my more desperate
moments, I have to admit this sounds pretty good. Who wants to experience
sleepless nights, dirty nappies, terrible twos, exhausting tweens, and teenage
angst, despite the moments of joy?
Big picture, this is part of the outsourcing revolution: We'd pay for this
service alongside the gardening, cleaning and online shopping. Certainly, raising
children is associated with love and satisfaction. But these innovations could

release mothers from the child-bearing and rearing responsibilities that restrict
our opportunities in the workforce and constitute decades of unpaid labour.
However, this is an ethical and legal minefield. Which party is legally
responsible if something happens to a child? Current liability frameworks blame
the end-users. These are usually the parents, guardian or childcare centres.
Writing in Scientific American, Dr George Maliha and Dr Ravi B. Parikh - who
work at the intersection of law, ethics, and the care sector - are calling for an
independent artificial intelligence safety system, with cases tried in special courts
with specific expertise. 'Regulators should deem some AIs too risky to introduce
into the market without standards for testing, retesting or validation,' they
write. This is bang on.
Then, we need to address the long-term societal impacts. Will this make
children more or less equal? What sort of culture are we creating? How can we
manage parents and children who become more self-centred with the
expectation that every need will be met? 'Chillingly, childrearing will become
standardised, limiting variance in personality,' Dr Tempest says, 'but others
would say that democratising nurturing would mean that every child would
have the same chance of success in later life.' Inevitably, artificial intelligence
nannies will creep up on parents incrementally, much like VEVO watching our
children sleep.
China is leading the way, raising the possibility of children being grown
instead of raised. This country is becoming a society run by artificial intelligence,
based around so-called 'smart cities'. This technology is expanding exponentially
since its extensive (and expensive) deployment in places like Beijing, Shanghai
and Shenzhen in 2011. Couples struggle with a high cost of living, low wages,
and long hours, deterring many from having children. Instead of tackling wealth
inequality, China is looking to tech to break the impasse. According to leading
AI futurist Michael Spencer: 'This is not science fiction.'
In 2022, researchers in Suzhou claim to develop an artificial intelligence
system able to monitor embryos as they grow into foetuses in the laboratory.
These embryos are cared for by an AI nanny, which adjusts the environment as
needed. The development of newborns via the use of algorithms and artificial
wombs 'is eerily similar to what we see in the cult classic, The Matrix', Spencer

writes in his newsletter, AI Supremacy. Although experimentation on human
foetuses is currently forbidden under international law, Spencer reckons this
scenario is more likely to happen than many of us realise: 'It would also facilitate
designer babies and children loyal to the state in a way that would contrast with
the individualism seen more now with the young people in China.'
While we wait for this great leap forward, ethics experts Joanna J. Bryson and
Ronny Bogani are optimistic about childcare robots. 'We believe it is unlikely
that robots will cause significant psychological damage,' they write in a chapter
for the 2021 book The Love Makers. 'The bottom line is that the robots
themselves will not love our children [although] we must always remember that
children will love their robots.'
There's a growing body of evidence this technology could provide therapy
support for children with intellectual disabilities and autism. The Australian e-
Health Research Centre is behind the software modules for five different social
robots for children. Students at Murray Bridge High School in South Australia
can work with socially assistive robots NAO and Pepper: 'Our long-term studies
show that robots have the potential to enrich the learning experiences of
students. Importantly, some of the benefits we observed in participants when
they interacted with robots are also transferring to their interactions with other
people.'
Dr Ayanna Howard, chair of the School for Interactive Computing at the
Georgia Institute of Technology, gives one example. Her team had been trying to
engage a child who wouldn't share. Then a miniature humanoid robot is added
to the mix. Almost immediately, the child starts interacting with it, saying, 'It's
your turn, it's your turn'. 'These are the kind of stories that make you say, "Yeah,
I'm going to keep doing this",' Dr Howard tells the MathWorks website in
2021.1 Children with developmental disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, must
endure hours upon hours of therapy. Robots keep kids engaged because they're
seen as cool and fun.
One controversial aspect of assistive technologies is whether they imply that
children with autism need to be 'fixed', which entrenches stereotypes about
people with disabilities: '... while gender and race are frequently deployed as
protected characteristics to be scrutinized in evaluating algorithmic systems,

disability is not,' academic Os Keyes writes in The Journal of Sociotechnical
Critique in 2020. 'Instead, it is often left (at best) unmarked. This is particularly
concerning given the increasing interest in explicitly applying algorithmic
systems to questions of disability.' Keyes is worried about how autism is
pathologised as something requiring intervention in order to 'normalise' people.
This highlights the power imbalance between those who design the
technology, and the people for whom it's created. The disparity is especially
acute in the child, disability and aged care sectors.

COMPUTER SAYS NO
'Old age is not a disease - it is strength and survivorship, triumph over all kinds of
vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illnesses.'
Maggie Kuhn, founder of the Gray Panthers movement
There's a global epidemic accompanying COVID-19: social isolation. Many
people who are older, immunocompromised or living with disabilities are
trapped in their homes, fearing the consequences of catching the virus. This is
exacerbated by people who refuse to wear masks, but that's a rant for another
time.
To combat isolation, the New York State Office for the Aging is 'deploying'
AI robots as companions. Sounds like a military campaign, albeit well-
intentioned. The robot ElliQ does daily check-ins, reminds you to take
medication and do physical activities, and connects with family and friends
using voice commands or on-screen instructions. ElliQ isn't only reactive, like
Google Home or Alexa: it's designed to initiate conversations and uses previous
chats to inform follow-up interactions. Best of all, this particular robot is
designed with input from older adults.
Innovations like this can't come soon enough. In Western nations, elderly
people are generally treated poorly. We're in the 2020-2030 United Nations
Decade of Healthy Aging, which encourages countries to 'meet the health care
needs of current and future older populations through innovative solutions'.
Already, artificial intelligence is being used in aged care facilities for early
diagnoses, monitoring, supervision, entertainment, stimulation, personal care
and mobility.

Still, there's something special about the human touch. Living with a
dynamic disability, I have a care worker in my home two half-days a week. I'd
hate to think of these women - care workers are predominantly female - being
put out of work and replaced by robots. Frankly, they deserve a big pay rise.
Unfortunately, this entire area of research is beset by age and gender bias. The
Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, which is the longest-running scientific
study of its kind in the US, has its genesis in 1958. Yet it doesn't bother to enrol
any women for the first 20 years. Yes, you read that right: two decades, and not
one woman.
Remember how the world is split by a 'digital divide', with women in low-
and middle-income countries less likely than men to own smartphones? When
there's less data about a particular group - whether in surveys or via technology
- it perpetually skews the research. A paper in the January 2022 issue of The
Gerontologist identifies how broader injustices in society foster ageism. 'Current
research examining biases in AI is largely focused on racial and gender biases and
the serious consequences that arise as a result; however, little attention has been
paid to age-related bias (known as ageism) in AI,' according to Charlene H. Chu
and co-authors.
This is leading to a digital underclass of older and poorer people. Also in
2022, the World Health Organization specifically warns about 'faulty or
discriminatory' historical datasets used in health care around the world, 'where
ageist practices are widespread'. While the WHO acknowledges the potential for
artificial intelligence to improve care for older people, the systems are being
encoded with 'stereotypes, prejudice or discrimination'.
We can't view this in a vacuum. The pandemic puts ageism and disability
front and centre. We live with the narrative that older people simply aren't worth
saving. Governments and communities allow COVID-19 to run rampant as
skyrocketing death rates become commonplace. At one stage, people are buried
in mass graves.
The WHO's Healthy Ageing unit points to practices allowing a patient's age
to determine whether they can access oxygen, or a bed in a crowded intensive
care unit, in hospitals worldwide. 'The implicit and explicit biases of society,
including around age, are often replicated in AI technologies,' Alana Officer,

from the Demographic Change and Healthy Ageing unit, tells the WHO
website. 'To ensure that AI technologies play a beneficial role, ageism must be
identified and eliminated from their design, development, use and evaluation.'1
This is why 'computer says no' more often if you're over 50. Digital ageism
means you'll get less access to health services.
This reminds me of the ethical thought experiment known as the 'trolley
problem'. (An out-of-control trolley is tearing towards five people, tied to the
tracks. You have two options: do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five
people on the main track; or pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto a side track
where it will kill only one person.) Say there's just one person on each track: a
60-year-old and a 30-year-old. Whose life is worth more?
But the problem begins well before we're on our deathbeds, gasping for air
and waiting in vain for a ventilator. Ageism is rampant in the tech sector. The
teams developing AI tend not to include older people. In a society that venerates
youth - with workplaces lauding 'digital natives' - paternalistic attitudes
towards older generations and technology become entrenched. Consequently,
many of us internalise this bigotry, crushing our confidence to learn new skills.
Only three out of four people over the age of 65 use the internet, according to
the Pew Research Center in the US.2 This percentage drops dramatically by the
time people are aged over 80. Older people are known as 'invisible users': our
exclusion from technology erases our interests, values and abilities. When
younger designers produce devices to be used by older people, they don't often
consider age-related changes in perception, cognition and psychomotor abilities.
My dad, who's aged in his eighties, struggles with this every day. We're unable
to find a new mobile phone he can operate with arthritis-ridden hands.
Eventually, my sister buys an old-school flip phone, with huge buttons and an
easy operating mode.
The inability of older people to utilise technology becomes self-perpetuating.
If few people in this demographic use social media, their likes, dislikes and
opinions aren't captured. When this data is used to train models for artificial
intelligence, they end up being riddled with age bias. In 2017, hiring platforms -
including the site Jobr - are investigated for discrimination because applicants
can't select either a graduation year or first job earlier than 1980.

As we know, if most of the employees in a company are young males, the
automated system will prioritise similar applicants. Google and LinkedIn have
both used software algorithms that target internet job advertisements at younger
applicants, excluding people older than 40. Facebook has also allowed business
users to microtarget ads to specific age groups, so older people are unable to see
particular products, services or jobs.
A major concern is the opacity of commercial artificial intelligence programs.
Protected by 'intellectual property' rights, it's almost impossible for regulatory
bodies to determine whether they're intentionally sidelining certain groups.
Ultimately, artificial intelligence will repeat the mistakes of the past, reproducing
society's hierarchies.
The question is this: Can technology be developed to mitigate human bias?
Chu and co-authors are calling for an interdisciplinary approach including
gerontologists, social scientists, philosophers, legal scholars, ethicists, clinicians
and technologists.
This harks back to the issue with the 'Founding Fathers' and their failure to
include other disciplines.
But a solution could be found by following the money. It's a smart decision
to design a wide range of artificial intelligence that meets the professional,
leisure, domestic, communication and health needs of a diverse cohort of people.
While the 'boomers' are currently considered to be the older generation, it'll
soon be Gen Xers like me who are moving into the 60-plus age group.
'Projections show older adults will likely make up the largest proportion of
technology (e.g., health-related, information and communication) consumers in
the future as today's tech-savvy adults grow older,' Chu writes. Woo hoo!
It seems some attention is finally being paid to warnings about ageism in
artificial intelligence. Johns Hopkins University is using a US$20 million grant
from the National Institute on Aging to work on AI devices to help older people
live independently for longer. The charter for the Penn Artificial Intelligence
and Technology Collaboratory for Healthy Aging (PennAITech) is to 'identify,
develop, evaluate, commercialise, and disseminate innovative technology and
artificial intelligence methods to support older adults with Alzheimer's disease in
their home environment'.

Japan is leading the way in 'age-tech'. This is born of necessity: nearly 33 per
cent of Japanese citizens are aged 65 or over. By way of comparison, in Australia
it's around 17 per cent, according to the 2021 Census.
Technology writer Daniel Allen delves into the digital devices driving health
care in Japan in a fascinating 2022 article for the MedicalExpo e-magazine. This
represents a glass half-full version of the future. By 2040, data will be collected
from each aged care resident and used to recommend the best individualised
meals, according to the article. Wearable devices will share real-time information
on the residents' health with medical institutions, allowing remote diagnosis.
And hybrid showers will recognise your face, and set the temperature to a
preferred level.3
This is part of the movement known as 'longevity medicine'. Another
example is the iAge clock, which is designed based on blood samples from 1001
people aged from eight to 96 years. It uses biomarkers to assess the wellbeing of
your immune system and your risk of chronic inflammatory disease. The higher
your iAge score, the greater the likelihood of health problems. This acts as an
early warning system, encouraging preventative measures and assisting with
medical decisions.
'By applying artificial intelligence methods to deep immune monitoring of
human blood, we generate an inflammatory clock of aging, which can be used as
a companion diagnostic to inform physicians about a patient's inflammatory
burden and overall health status, especially those with chronic diseases,' the iAge
website reads.
Deep Longevity is a company working on tech that will track the rate of
ageing according to biomarkers including molecular, cellular, tissue, organ,
physiological and psychological. It aims to create interventions to slow or even
reverse the ageing process. This is nothing short of miraculous.
Researchers at Cambridge University say artificial intelligence could spot the
early signs of dementia from a simple brain scan long before major symptoms
appear. A program designed by the university and The Alan Turing Institute
can already predict with 80 per cent accuracy whether those presenting with
cognitive impairment will go on to develop Alzheimer's.

An artificial intelligence companion that tells stories is being developed in the
UK. The project is called AMPER. I'm trying to avoid acronyms, but this is
easier to remember than its full name: Agent-based Memory Prosthesis to
Encourage Reminiscing. This companion prompts people with dementia to tell
their stories. What a fabulous innovation!
According to the project's website: 'The aim of AMPER is to assist people in
retrieving their memories and we hope this will help to strengthen people's self-
esteem and feelings of belonging, thus leading to better quality of life and
prolonging independent living.'
This sounds more sensible than a much-touted toy seal that's supposed to
help patients with dementia. The therapeutic robot, PARO, costs £6000 - well
beyond most people's budgets.4 Despite the media hype, a literature review
reveals 'mixed evidence' for the effectiveness of AI-enhanced gimmicks. In a
2022 paper in The Lancet Healthy Longevity journal, Kate Loveys and co-
authors find caregivers like the devices better than residents; people are
uncomfortable with monitoring by artificial intelligence during sleep; and the
effect of artificial intelligence on depressive symptoms is 'underwhelming'.5
While PARO decreases loneliness and assists communication between
residents and nursing home staff, one study says exposure to the pet seal is
associated with increased levels of wandering. There are also ethical
considerations about automatons that look like pets. 'Older people living with
dementia might be deceived into believing the robot is a real pet and might be at
risk of infantilisation from some technologies,' the paper says. 'Some older
people form attachments with robots and experience distress when separated at
the end of a trial.'
This demonstrates that people perceive these robots to be real.
There's something tangible about care bots. You can see them - and believe
in their existence - with your own eyes. But a more insidious form of artificial
intelligence comes in the form of Frankenstein datasets.

FRANKENSTEIN DATASETS
'I saw—with shut eyes, but acute mental vision—I saw the pale student of
unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous
phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful
engine, show signs of life and stir with an uneasy, half-vital motion. Frightful must
it be, for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock
the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world.'
Mary Shelley, Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus
Science fiction is often far from fact. But Mary Shelley is remarkably prescient in
her 1818 novel The Modern Prometheus. Artificial intelligence is akin to
Frankenstein's monster. The similarities aren't skin deep: the very idea for
Shelley's novel is sparked by a challenge from the poet Lord Byron, father of the
first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace. Shelley describes the creature as
'superhuman' in speed, with his cognitive development faster than humans.
This sounds like an early description of machine learning.
We discover too late that Dr Victor Frankenstein's programming is faulty.
The monster learns deeply but not well, developing multiple prejudices. As Igor
could well have said, 'I've got a hunch this won't end well'. In the Western
classical tradition, Prometheus is a figure representing human striving -
particularly for scientific knowledge - and unintended consequences.
Fast forward to 2021 and a new term enters the lexicon: Frankenstein
datasets. Governments, health care agencies, and corporations are madly
stitching together data from different sources to manage another monster: the
pandemic. These data are written in a variety of languages, may be obtained
from questionable sources, and could contain duplicate images and information.
Why does this matter? Well, as any tech-head will tell you, 'garbage in = garbage

out'. Loading poor quality information into artificial intelligence systems results
in rubbish.
One of the world's largest datasets - the University of California Irvine
Machine Learning Repository - opens its doors in 1987. According to my old
photo albums, this is the peak year of perms and panel vans. It's a true record of
the era: every doctor is 'he' and every nurse is 'she'. When used to program
machines, the data reinforce stereotypes. Furthermore, there are twice as many
men as women in this particular repository.
So what about public sets like Google Trends, which tracks search engine
data? Anyone can contribute to these: your racist Aunty Katie; sexist Uncle
Simon. As much as we don't like to admit it, all humans are biased. Often, we
allow bigotry to flow freely in the privacy of our homes, hunched over mobile
devices.
Like Dr Frankenstein, we're embedding ourselves into our creations. Bad
data goes in, then worsens through machine learning. The baby bias, born into
the algorithm, matures into a troublesome teenager. To be fair, teens can be
terrific. But their prefrontal cortex only matures at the age of 25. Nobody wants
immature and unpredictable machines guiding our futures.
Disturbingly, machine learning models for diagnosing COVID-19 are trained
on Frankenstein datasets. As my grandmother would say, 'haste makes waste'. In
an attempt to cope with the pace of the pandemic, these systems are being
developed too quickly. 'A lack of consistency in the reporting and availability of
disaggregated, detailed data on COVID-19 in the US has limited the application
of artificial intelligence methods and the effectiveness of those methods for
projecting the spread and subsequent impacts of this disease in communities,'
according to Tessa Swanson and co-authors in an article in the Journal of Risk
Research. Data bias is contaminating the system from the outset - much like the
virus itself.
Let's get deeply nerdy and look at a systemic review of all published papers on
machine learning methods for detecting COVID-19 from chest screenings. I
suggest you pour a stiff drink and sit down for this one. In Nature Machine
Intelligence, Michael Roberts and co-authors write: 'despite huge efforts of
researchers to develop machine learning models for COVID-19 diagnosis and

prognosis... none of the models identified are of potential clinical use due to
methodological flaws and/or underlying biases.' None. Zero. Zip. One headline
in Analytics India Magazine says it all: 'ML-Based COVID-19 Research is
Dud.' A dangerous dud.
In a 2020 research paper, the co-lead of Google's ethical AI team, Timnit
Gebru, is courageous enough to call out the racist and sexist infestation of large
language models, which are trained on an ever-increasing amount of text from
the internet. Gebru and co-authors have the temerity to ask 'whether enough
thought has been put into the potential risks associated with developing [large
language models] and strategies to mitigate these risks'. Is Gebru promoted?
Given a raise? Even a pat on the back? After all, this is her job: to promote ethical
AI. No. She's summarily sacked.
Far from being an academic conversation about the nuances of language, this
can be the difference between life and death. Already, mortality rates for
COVID-19 are exponentially higher for people in marginalised communities. A
study by Harvard University finds Black women are four times more likely to die
from COVID-19 than white men. The UK's Office for National Statistics
reveals that Black populations overall are at greater risk of dying after
contracting coronavirus than white people.
We know artificial intelligence is susceptible to algorithmic biases. Deploying
it willy-nilly amplifies the virus's impact on vulnerable groups. This happens in a
variety of ways. In some cases, data is only collected from private hospitals in
overwhelmingly wealthy white areas, because they have the latest technology.
Consequently, these data aren't relevant when training machines in hospitals in
poorer, predominantly Black areas. This issue is so common it has a name:
'health care data silos'.
'Discrimination creep' is another issue. Doctors, nurses and radiologists write
case notes for patients. These are programmed into the natural language
processing technologies word for word, including the medical team's
unconscious bias. Inevitably racism, sexism and ageism infiltrate the process.
The machine stores these words and - over time - finds patterns between them,
in order to predict what comes next.

This is how bias is breeding throughout our health systems like golden staph.
The problem worsens through the conflation of environmental or
socioeconomic causes with biological characteristics. Crikey! A lot of long words
there. Genetic anthropologist Amy Non puts it best: 'There are so many
historical biases that date back to slavery times that are still used in medicine
today. It's shocking.'
Take spirometers, for example. These are used on COVID-19 patients to
estimate their lung damage and determine whether they're referred for
rehabilitation or treatment trials. I experience this during treatment for long
COVID. Doctors, who use spirometers to measure lung capacity, historically
make 'corrections' for the patient's race. Sounds like phrenology all over again.
They reduce the 'normal' reading by 13-15 per cent for people of colour and up
to 6 per cent for people of Asian heritage, based on a belief that particular races
biologically have lower lung capacity. Anyone else think this is close to biological
determinism?
A recent systemic review reveals this is dangerously incorrect. White
populations generally have larger lung capacity for environmental and
socioeconomic reasons - not biological reasons - primarily due to living in more
developed countries. This misunderstanding by the medical profession can be
deadly. Black and Brown people whose lungs are already compromised need to
present with even lower lung capacity to qualify for treatment routinely offered
to white people.
Put simply, people of colour have to be sicker to get the same level of care. It's
appalling. The broad practice of 'race correction' in the medical field finally ends
in 2021, more than two centuries after Thomas Jefferson writes erroneously
about the 'difference of structure in the pulmonary apparatus' between Black
enslaved people and white folks.
It's not only evident in hospitals. The trend towards 'hospital in the home'
means coronavirus patients have to use an AI tool to measure oxygen levels in
the blood when deciding whether to call an ambulance. I've been using a pulse
oximeter daily while struggling with this illness. 'The way the device works,
however, is prone to racial bias and was likely calibrated on light-skinned users,'
journalist Natalie Grover writes in Horizon, the European Commission

Research & Innovation magazine. 'Back in 2005, a study showed the device
"mostly tended to overestimate (oxygen) saturation levels by several points" for
nonwhite people.'
Yes, you read that right. Manufacturers of the pulse oximeter have known
about this for more than 15 years - 15 years - and done nothing about it. People
in marginalised communities are caught in a vicious cycle. The data from this
flawed tool is being fed into diagnostic algorithms, which will be used in
hospitals in the future.
Women and girls are disproportionally affected by health care discrimination.
An obvious example is pregnant women being routinely excluded from clinical
trials. 'Men and male bodies have long been the standard for medical testing,'
Genevieve Smith and Ishita Rustagi write in the Stanford Social Innovation
Review. 'Women are missing from medical trials, with female bodies deemed too
complex and variable.' Half of almost 1000 trials related to COVID-19 explicitly
exclude pregnancy, and expectant women are shut out of vaccine trials. The
reasons are complex, including risk and legal liability. But we need more data
about pregnant people - not less.
These archaic attitudes remind me of the old advertisements for pads and
tampons, with blue liquid representing blood, as if genteel folk would be
horrified by the thought of menstruation. Our bodies are considered so
disgusting we comprise the minority of cases in medical data, despite
constituting the majority of the population.
'For millennia, medicine has functioned on the assumption that male bodies
can represent humanity as a whole,' Caroline Criado-Perez writes in her 2019
book Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men. 'As a result, we
have a huge historical data gap when it comes to female bodies, and this is a data
gap that is continuing to grow as researchers carry on ignoring the pressing
ethical need to include female cells, animals and humans, in their research. That
this is still going on in the twenty-first century is a scandal. It should be the
subject of newspaper headlines worldwide. Women are dying, and the medical
world is complicit. It needs to wake up.'
Of course, it's not only gender bias. Using artificial intelligence, researchers
perform a global scoping review of more than 7000 clinical papers in PubMed.

They discover most databases originate in the US and China. Almost all of the
top ten databases are from high-income countries. Why is this an issue? AI
doesn't work well when it has to generalise outside of the cohort data. Growing
up in a low socio-economic area, my family is acutely aware of the 'right' and
'wrong' side of the tracks. Full disclosure: we're from the wrong side.
This is analogous to artificial intelligence: Data-rich regions benefit
substantially compared with data-poor regions, entrenching disparities in health
care. It's crucial for practitioners to understand who may be negatively affected.
The phenomenon of 'bias in - bias out' can have catastrophic consequences for
patients. Who's offered the first COVID-19 vaccines? When resources are scarce,
who'll get the last ventilator, oxygen tank, or intensive care bed? Imagine being
on your deathbed and hearing, 'Computer says no'.
People with severe cases of COVID-19 often end up with sepsis. In western
Sydney, Emergency physician Amith Shetty decides to investigate whether an AI
tool used to detect patients with this infection is working properly. Sepsis, which
is formerly known as blood poisoning, can be fatal. It causes an estimated half of
all hospital deaths. Dr Shetty's research reveals the Sepsis Alert performs
'modestly' in all five emergency departments: it doesn't identify every infected
patient. I don't think 'modestly' is what you want when your loved one is lying
in hospital dying of blood poisoning.
The history of artificial intelligence in medicine is littered with similar
examples. Back in 2012, IBM's Watson supercomputer is unleashed on an
unsuspecting US health system. It's hyped as the future of cancer research. Six
years later, internal IBM documents reveal Watson recommends 'unsafe and
incorrect' cancer treatments, with one doctor telling IBM executives, 'This
product is a piece of shit'.
Hospital systems are extremely vulnerable to hacking and cyber attacks,
according to a 2021 study published in Nature Communications. 'Motivations
to commit adversarial attacks can include monetary gain, insurance fraud,
temptation of favorable clinical trial outcomes, among others,' Qianwei Zhou
and co-authors write. Fake samples can fool AI models into making the wrong
diagnosis. For example, a computer program could add or remove evidence of
cancer from mammograms. In Zhou's study, around 70 per cent of the

manipulated images fool the artificial intelligence; the accuracy of radiologists
varies from 29 per cent to 71 per cent.
Hackers could also break into internet-connected insulin pumps and deliver
deadly doses of medication. The number of ransomware attacks on US health
care organisations is almost doubling every year. In 2021, the mother of a baby
who dies in Alabama launches a lawsuit, alleging this is the first death by
ransomware. She blames a hack of the hospital's computer system for the failure
of heart rate monitors, leading to fatal brain damage.
I sound like Chicken Little in this chapter: 'The sky is falling!' Despite the
sound of many acorns dropping to the earth, I must acknowledge artificial
intelligence is revolutionising health care. AI expert at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Regina Barzilay, tells The Washington Post about
returning to work after breast cancer leave: 'I walked in the door to my office and
thought, "We here at MIT are doing all this sophisticated algorithmic work that
could have so many applications, [while] one subway stop away the people who
could benefit from it are dying".' Barzilay and a protégé build an artificial
intelligence - known as Mirai - that identifies whether a healthy person will get
breast cancer up to five years before diagnosis.
Google develops a similar system that interprets CT scans to predict the
likelihood of lung cancer. A trial of artificial intelligence software at
Queensland's Princess Alexandra Hospital gives early warnings before a patient's
condition declines. And researchers at the University of Utah find AI-powered
retinal scans can forecast the later onset of cardiovascular disease. Of course, it
remains to be seen what insurance companies would do with this information.
It's like the dilemma surrounding genetic testing: Do you really want life
insurers knowing about a pre-existing illness or diseases for which you have a
predisposition?
A new medical device, based on artificial intelligence, can assist clinicians to
accurately diagnose autism spectrum disorder in children up to six years of age.
A related study, led by Northwestern University in Illinois, uses machine
learning to identify speech patterns in children with autism that are consistent
between English and Cantonese. These features of speech can be useful in early
diagnosis.

You know how some people have an unerring sense of direction? We tend to
say they have their own 'internal GPS'. This could soon be a reality, with a team
at MIT working on an ingestible and directional implant to monitor tumour
growth, heart rate and breathing. It could eventually deliver drugs to specific
regions of the body.
Of course, artificial intelligence is at the forefront of unravelling the mysteries
of long COVID. In the US, the National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C)
includes de-identified data from 72 sites representing 13 million patients.
However, the first attempt at building an algorithm to identify long COVID
patients is fraught with difficulty.
'There was literally no structured way for a physician to enter "I think this
patient has long Covid",' Emily Pfaff, who co-leads the long COVID working
group at N3C, tells StatNews in 2022.1 'We had to get creative and find a proxy.'
They settle on records from about 500 patients who show up at three specialty
clinics. The model performs 'decently' when tested, which is reminiscent of
'modestly'.
There are concerns the data might overrepresent long COVID patients with
respiratory symptoms because two of the clinics are based in pulmonary
departments. Most of my symptoms are neurological, cardiac and autonomic -
not pulmonary. Inevitably, swathes of people who are suffering will be put on
the wrong treatments, while serious manifestations will be missed. In the US and
Australia, most of the clinics are in large metropolitan areas, servicing wealthier
patients. Will this data be transferable to patients in poorer areas, or developing
countries? If not, this is really troubling.
It again begs the question: what happens when the algorithms get it wrong?
Who's at fault and legally liable? Clinicians, data scientists or policy-makers?
There's no clear consensus. 'The biases of prior practices and the perpetuation
of exclusionary processes toward women can lead to inaccurate medical
decisions,' Angelica Marotta writes in her 2022 paper 'When AI Is Wrong:
Addressing Liability Challenges in Women's Healthcare': 'The ramifications of
such errors show that the incorrect use of AI raises several critical questions
regarding who should be responsible for potential incidents.'2

Identifying who or what is liable is hard because of 'the black box' problem.
Many artificial intelligence systems make recommendations based on data
without supplying details about how these decisions are reached. Medtech using
artificial intelligence will only be successful if doctors understand the perils,
particularly in complicated cases.
This problem is pressing, with the European Union's latest General Data
Protection Regulation coming into effect in mid-2018.3 The ramifications are
clear: every citizen now has a 'right to explanation'. If I had the energy, I'd be
dancing with joy. I'm lying in bed utterly spent after dealing with medical
professionals who often disregard a patient's right to know. In future, any
organisation which has trade dealings with the EU is legally required to justify
decisions based on algorithms to people whose data they hold. It's not enough
for an artificial intelligence system to tell physicians and patients that something
is true. Doctors need to be able to tell patients why.
Currently, most doctors don't have the foggiest idea about deep neural
networks, which come to conclusions from image-based medical software. They
may be able to discern between malignant and benign tumours. But there's no
explanation about how the software comes to this conclusion. Is it possible for
patients to make informed consent if no-one actually knows what's going on?
'We have people in the field who are able to turn the crank but don't actually
know what they're doing, and don't actually understand the foundational
underpinnings of what they're doing,' Zachary Lipton, a computer scientist at
Carnegie Mellon University, tells the website Undark in 2019. 'The truth is that
you don't even usually have historical data that is representative of any real-
world process. You have some kind of weird Frankenstein data that was cobbled
together from a bunch of sources.'
Dr Emma Schleiger is a multidisciplinary research scientist at CSIRO's
Data61. She says that in many cases we can't understand exactly what the inputs
are because the artificial intelligence has generated its own neural network,
making it 'way too complicated for us to be able to explain'. Still, given the
advantages of black box AI in the medical sector, she says it's not all bad: 'Rather
than saying, "oh, black boxes are bad", we need to think about the situations that
we're using them in. So for diagnosis, if I suspected skin cancer and I knew AI

was going to be better at detecting it than a doctor, I would rather have that
threshold higher.'
How do we manage the bodgy bots, while appreciating the benefits of this
tech? Stefan Hajkowicz, principal scientist in strategy and foresight at Data61,
says artificial intelligence is going to be critical in solving conundrums in health
care, where expenditure is growing at unsustainable rates. 'AI is going to be able
to save many people from cancer,' he tells the business technology site ZDNet in
2019.
The starting point is critical analysis: we must admit this technology is far
from perfect. Artificial intelligence programs are complex. Some applications
have thousands of lines of code and are written in five different languages.
Unfortunately, most computer scientists tend to see only the beauty, rather than
the beast.
The monster kills many of Victor Frankenstein's family and friends. But he
can't bring himself to kill it: 'I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole
purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of
rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation.'
Artificial intelligence has limitless potential to improve the diagnosis and
treatment of billions of people around the world. But if single-minded
developers ignore the warning signs, the twenty-first century version of Mary
Shelley's monster will be even more lethal. Will modern-day Dr Frankensteins be
able to control their creations? Or will humanity increasingly escape into virtual
worlds?

FAIR GAME
'Fortnite, because of its visual style, it's widely acceptable to just about everyone.'
Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games
Do you play Fortnite? Are you aware of the pleasures of a Battle Royale? This
first-person shooter game is the brainchild of Tim Sweeney, who likes to pitch
himself as the 'good guy' of gaming. One of his early projects is Jill of the Jungle,
a trilogy in which the third part is entitled Jill Saves the Prince. 'Tremendous,'
you might be thinking. 'A feminist in the notoriously misogynistic world of
gaming.' Not quite.
Jill is a highly sexualised character, resplendent with long blonde hair, pert
breasts and muscular thighs. It's argued Fortnite isn't as bad as other games
because many of the female characters act in masculine ways, and some of the
male fighters have feminine attributes. My son and daughter play the game and
rave about the rocking 'skins' for the female characters, like the Red Knight and
Valkyrie. Look at the old lady keeping up with the young 'uns! I have no idea
what I'm writing, but the teens say I'm 'slaying'.
By all accounts, the makers of Fortnite, Epic Games, try to do everything
right. Game designer and associate professor Celia Pearce tells the Northeastern
University website that Fortnite is designed to appeal to a wide and inclusive
audience. This is an enormous task in an industry dominated by young men.
But women are still finding it a hostile environment.
'If you go in and identify yourself as female, you are likely to get harassed in
spite of all the best intentions of the game design,' Pearce says. 'That really
concerns me because it shows that this toxic male culture - which has gone

unchecked for the past decade - is so pervasive that even if you, as a company,
make a decision to make a more inclusive game, it's not enough.'
Epic Games uses bright colours and cartoony characters with multiple play
modes including exploring and building, rather than purely fighting. In honour
of International Women's Day 2022, the company offers free items to redeem,
and features Islands by female creators. And the game costs nothing to play on
multiple platforms. 'It seems to be the case that more women and girls are
playing Fortnite because it's free and available on mobile, so it's easier to get into
the game,' Pearce explains. Traditionally, game consoles are bought and enjoyed
primarily by men. Despite these efforts, only around one in four Fortnite players
is female.
Before the 2019 Fortnite World Cup, Epic Games proffers a US$3 million
grand prize for the best team. Not a single, solitary woman makes it to the final
event. According to Team Bumble member Madison Mann, girls stop playing
because of the negative messages they receive. Mann tells Forbes magazine about
some of the trolling: 'Get back to the kitchen, girls can't play video games, girls
suck at video games, and other sexist nonsense.'
How far have we really progressed from the days of #gamergate? You may
remember this hateful, right-wing backlash against diversity in gaming culture.
In 2014, doxing, rape and death threats are targeted at women in the industry,
such as feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian.
Game-makers are trying to address online harassment, but with little impact.
Exhibit A: the continued practice of 'teabagging' in video games. Also known as
'tactical squatting', a player's avatar crouches up and down while standing over
an enemy player's body. While some pundits see this as asserting dominance,
others consider it a form of sexual assault.
Of course, it's the latter: The dictionary definition of teabagging is, 'the act of
placing one's testicles in the mouth of another person, often repeatedly, raising
and lowering it like a person dipping a tea bag'. A similar act is referred to as
'corpse humping' in the game Halo. 'In Halo 4, projecting a hologram onto a
corpse would reward players with the sight of the hologram humping the
corpse,' Luci S writes on the website Gamerant.

Further to this are concerns about cultural appropriation. Countless Black
artists are calling out Epic Games for stealing the iconic Fortnite dance. If you
have teens or tweens, you'd have witnessed these unique moves, which are also
known as 'flossing'. I remember seeing kids doing it by the side of the road and
in shopping malls.
Reaching the source of the dance would take you to 'the streets of Memphis,
Tennessee; to the assembled young men as they are captured in the song's video,
leaning on the trunks of cars, throwing dice, holding guns, laughing and dancing
with abandon', motion designer Yussef Cole writes for Vice.com. He says
rappers like Blocboy JB are at the forefront of those raising concerns; 2 Milly is
among a handful who've gone so far as to initiate lawsuits.
Does this mean Fortnite is akin to a modern-day minstrel show? '... the
manner in which Fortnite has transplanted the creative output of these men into
its brightly colored marionettes, without permission, credit, or compensation
feels particularly egregious,' Cole writes. Many of these lawsuits have since been
withdrawn.
In 2022, choreographer Kyle Hanagami begins legal action over a dance
called 'It's Complicated'. Hanagami claims it's quite simple, really: Epic Games
is responsible for stealing the 'hook' of his dance without consent. Hanagami
holds a copyright for the dance. If successful, this could have become a precedent
for future legal action. But a federal judge in the Central District of California
dismisses the case.
Many Indigenous gamers and developers are disappointed about the
stereotypical portrayals of characters and imagery in modern games, such as
Horizon: Forbidden West. A near-future dystopia, the game features factions
including the Tenakth, who dress in leather, fur and feathers, sometimes with
ornate headdresses. The Tenakth worship pilots from the American Air Force as
sacred warriors. One day, regular player @JohnTomKnight tweets, 'Hey
@Guerrilla and @PlayStation, just curious... When making Horizon [Forbidden]
West, were any Native/Indigenous people involved in creating the story or art for
this game?' Knight is an enrolled citizen of the Cherokee Nation.
Incidentally, this isn't the first time Guerrilla Games is accused of bigotry.
Back in 2017, the company uses the words 'braves', 'savages' and 'primal' to

describe some factions. This is unsurprising when you consider as few as 2 per
cent of game designers are Black. There are no solid statistics on how many are
Indigenous.
So where does artificial intelligence fit into this? Almost all video games have
AI-based components. In fact, game-playing is an area of research in artificial
intelligence from its inception. One of the first examples is the computerised
game Nim, made in 1951. This is 20 years before the explosion of gaming,
courtesy of a little game called Pong. The same year sees chequers and chess first
played by computers, culminating in Deep Blue beating world champ Garry
Kasparov in 1997. During the golden age of video arcade games, the concept of
opponents created by artificial intelligence becomes popular.
Remember Space Invaders? As adults 'of a certain age' we have a retro Space
Invaders machine at home. It's remarkable technology for its time. The game
Galaxian adds more complexity, especially when the enemy fighter jets begin
firing from all angles. This sends me into panic attacks, much to the teens'
amusement. Pac-Man (and, of course, Pac-Woman) brings artificial intelligence
to action maze games.
Later computer games use so-called 'bottom up' methods of information
processing, allowing real-time changes in strategy based on player behaviour. In
1996, an artificial life program named Creatures enables you to 'hatch' small
furry animals. The 'Norns' represent the first popular application of machine
learning in an interactive simulation. Neural networks are used by the creatures
to learn what to do, while interacting with their environment.
What are neural networks? I'm glad you asked! Actually, that's a lie. Living
with brain fog is like lingering in a liminal space. Fortunately, one of my dearest
friends is a computer genius. You can thank James McIlwain for this explanation
of an extremely complex concept.
Your brain contains around 100 billion cells, known as neurons - the tiny
switches that let you think and remember things. Computers contain billions of
miniature 'brain cells', too. These are called transistors. Made from silicon,
transistors are miniature electronic components that work as either amplifiers or
switches. Neural networks are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way
biological neurons signal to one another. They rely on training data to learn and

improve their accuracy over time. These finely tuned algorithms allow us to
classify and cluster data at a high velocity. Think Google Search, or the 'Norns'
from Creatures.
Since that time, the technology has advanced rapidly. In 2021, Sony CEO
Kenichiro Yoshida says his artificial intelligence research division will collaborate
with PlayStation to build clever, computer-controlled characters. 'By leveraging
reinforcement learning, we are developing game AI agents that can be a player's
in-game opponent or collaboration partner,' he announces in a press release.
Reinforcement learning is a subset of machine learning. Basically, the AI learns
through trial and error, much like humans.
'In short, these characters will mimic human players,' journalist Keith Stuart
writes in The Guardian in 2021. 'To some extent, they will think.' The game
Watch Dogs: Legion is a fascinating case study in what can be achieved with this
technology. It generates 'life stories, relationships and daily routines for every
London citizen you interact with', Stuart writes. If you save a character's life one
day, their best mate might join you the next.'
While the tech expands apace, there remain serious issues around inclusion. If
we want to see characters with differing backgrounds and experiences,
developers need to diversify their workforces. Uma Jayaram, the general manager
of SEED - the research team at game publisher Electronic Arts - draws her
global team from different genders, ethnicities and cultures.
'A diverse team allows for multiple points of view to coalesce and creates
possibilities for a more representative outcome and product,' she tells The
Guardian. 'It also enhances opportunities to create awareness, empathy and
respect for individuals who are different from us. A video game is, in a way, an
extension of our physical world, and a place where people spend time and form
rich experiences that loop back into the collective sense of self and community.'1
Well, this all sounds marvellous. Sunshine and rainbows!
However, we should be wary of diversity and inclusion being viewed as add-
ons. When this happens, it puts huge pressure on people from marginalised
communities, who already live with less job security, status and power. It can't
be left to these people to perform the emotional labour of educating their
managers and peers about appropriate workplace culture. Like every other sector

using artificial intelligence, gaming needs to evolve its leadership structures.
Lasting change must be top-down, as well as bottom-up. It's a terrible shame
that hegemony remains the dominant force in the technology sector.
One of the fundamental elements shaping artificial intelligence is the
inclination to think about video games as adversarial systems, where allies and
enemies are perennially in combat. But there is another way. Glow Up Games
caters to diverse audiences. This company lets players construct AI systems or
agents for others, helping them understand how artificial intelligence works.
Tru-Luv, a development studio responsible for the popular #SelfCare app, is
working on technologies reflecting its progressive culture. One-third of Tru-
Luv's workforce is Black, Indigenous and people of colour, while the executive
team is 100 per cent female. The studio's founder is Brie Code. Sidebar: how
cool is it that Brie's last name is 'Code'? If that's not nominative determinism, I
don't know what is. I wonder if she works with someone called Mac.
'The games industry has focused on a narrow subset of human psychology
for several years,' Code tells The Guardian. 'It is very good at creating
experiences that help people feel a sense of achievement or dominance. Game AI
created by a diverse workforce will bring life to NPCs (non-player characters)
and experiences that represent the breadth and depth of the human experience.
We'll see more non-zero-sum experiences, more compassion, more emotional
resonance, more insight, more transcendence. We'll see new forms of play that
leverage feelings of creativity, love and joy more so than triumph or
domination.'2
This represents a priceless opportunity to abandon age-old stereotypes by
ensuring the algorithms promote fairness and respect. I want to say it's a
feminine, rather than masculine, approach, but that's leaning on far too many
outdated stereotypes.
Beyond diversity, data mining is a growing issue in gaming. This allows
designers to explore what parts people like to play and the factors causing them
to stop playing. Then, developers can tweak the gameplay to make more money.
If you're wondering who to blame for the sudden dent in your bank account
after an errant tween buys too many Fortnite skins, it's the developers. This is no

accident. The skins, or costumes, make your character more powerful, which is
an intoxicating prospect for a hyped-up player keen for a Battle Royale.
In Fortnite, artificial intelligence is used in the enemy bots and neutral
characters. Epic Games delves deep into analytics to make psychological
observations about player behaviour. Are they lone wolves or alliance-builders?
The AI also monitors what's called 'emergent' gameplay and adapts challenges
to suit the players' styles.
Full disclosure: this exploration of artificial intelligence in gaming is
somewhat contentious. Many experts bewail the use of the term 'AI' in this field,
claiming it isn't about intelligence at all. They say gaming is distinctly different
from academic artificial intelligence, which they consider to be the 'real AI'.
Perhaps they're right: only the academic kind addresses the complexities of
machine learning and decision-making from arbitrary input. There's a sniff of
'nasty commercialism getting in the way of robust academic research'.
Game AI is branching away, building its own worlds. Still, I reckon gaming
should be considered a sub-branch of artificial intelligence. This is like rock 'n'
roll being under the umbrella of classical music, because it uses similar
instruments but breaks many of the rules.
Now, let's look at what Tim Sweeney is calling 'the biggest technological
revolution in our lifetime'.

REALITY CHECK
'Books are the original virtual reality.'
Marsha Dark, author, artist and transhumanist
Artificial intelligence and game development are growing symbiotically. You're
about to enjoy a delicious acronym soup as we explore augmented reality and
virtual reality. AR and VR are progressively being incorporated into these
platforms, making the games as realistic as possible. If data gathered through
artificial intelligence is used to build future games, they'll inevitably be skewed
towards male players. The Finn brothers from the antipodean band Split Enz are
dead wrong: history always repeats. AI-based voice assistants are coming into the
gaming sector too, cementing the bias detailed in previous chapters.
Augmented and virtual reality create bridges between the digital and physical
worlds. You're probably aware of VR headsets, which can transport you onto a
rollercoaster, beautiful beach or soaring hang glider. They're also used in tours
of museums and art galleries. AR is usually used for technical training. For
example, you can wear high-tech glasses to look in detail at an aircraft engine.
Using voice, images and text, the 'smart glasses' explain the engine's
components, and how to fix or replace them. Mixed reality (MR) combines both
VR and AR. And they all come under the term, extended reality (XR).
Confused yet? I certainly am. So what does it mean in layperson's terms?
In the workplace, this technology is ideal for transferring skills from retiring
workers to a new generation. This is timely as baby boomers retire and birth
rates continue to fall. We're living through a time of skills shortages. Tech helps
to bring people up to speed quickly and efficiently.

The augmented, virtual and mixed reality market is expected to exceed
US$250 billion by 2028, according to Statista.1 This is gobsmacking. Back in
2021, it was only worth US$28 billion. And who are the big players? You
guessed it: Google and Facebook.
It takes thousands of hours of programming to design and develop each of
these apps. Most of the programmers are white men. What will this mean for
police departments, which are using virtual reality to train officers for crisis
situations? Will embedded bias in the images - for example, depicting criminals
as being Black or Latinx - reinforce existing biases within the minds of these
officers?
There are also significant differences between males and females around the
sense of immersion in altered reality spaces. Men generally report a greater sense
of spatial presence and more perceived realism. This makes gaming less enjoyable
for women wearing the headsets, but there are more serious implications.
Educators are using augmented and virtual reality to teach students. If the
content resonates more deeply with boys and men, women and girls will receive
inferior teaching.
What about the myriad privacy complications associated with the smart
glasses used with these headsets? The filming and recording function makes it
possible to 'broadcast' someone's movements without their knowledge. This
represents an unprecedented surveillance of everyday life.
The health care sector is eyeing off these glasses to improve the productivity
of clinicians and their staff. Patient data can be captured and stored in real time.
But what happens if this information is hacked, or there's a security breach?
They're even dangerous to wear in your own home. If hackers gain control of
your smart glasses, they could see PIN numbers and passwords.
Still, the tech giants are forging forward: Ray-Ban Stories is a collection of
smart glasses as part of a collaboration with Meta. The glasses have an 'indicator
light' to show when they're recording, but it's barely visible. Meta needs to be
more careful to avoid the fate of Google Glass, which was laughed out of the
market.
In mid-2022, Meta releases a report highlighting 'salient risks' with these
glasses, including a requirement for 'informed consent from bystanders'. A tiny

red light does not represent consent. Believe it or not, there are also instances of
smart glasses making people feel ill, a phenomenon known as 'cyber sickness'.
One research paper reveals four out of five people report cyber sickness after 10-
15 minutes of gameplay.
When you think about it, these innovations challenge what it means to be
human. The use of altered reality creates a minefield. Not quite as dangerous as
the minefields in Fortnite, but problematic nonetheless. For example, extended
reality enables you to interact with virtual representations of real people. 'Thus,
along these lines, is it wrong to perform immoral acts in VR?' asks Distinguished
Investigator at the University of Barcelona Mel Slater and co-authors in an
article published in the journal Frontiers in 2020.2
This is further explored in a 2013 play, The Nether, by Jennifer Haley: a man
commits paedophilia in a fully immersive virtual world. In the play, the man
argues to the police this is a safe way to realise his unacceptable drives without
harming anyone. Should this be allowed? After all, we're shaped by what we
imagine. Or is policing our imaginations the ultimate fascism?
The second episode from Season 2 of the sci-fi comedy series Red Dwarf
addresses this quandary. 'Better than Life' introduces a total immersion video
game which works by inserting electrodes into your frontal lobes and
hypothalamus. Players have the ability to indulge all their fantasies. They can
command into existence any object, person or environment. However, once the
user starts to play, their mind purely perceives the reality of the game. All signals
from their real body, except for extreme pain, are ignored. Another spoiler alert:
the users have a bad habit of starving to death.
A fundamental moral principle is for humans to treat others with respect. Do
virtual characters deserve the same treatment? This reminds me of how we speak
to robots. If we treat chatbots poorly, will we end up treating humans badly? Or
if we act violently towards virtual characters, are we causing psychological harm
to the people those characters represent?
'In XR this is different though - in movies it is other people who treat other
people badly whereas in XR it could be ourselves doing so, or other (virtual or
online) people may treat us badly,' Slater and co-authors write. 'While this
already takes place in video-games, particularly when the character is seen and

controlled from a first-person perspective, XR goes a step further in the sense
that it can feel more real if the participant is fully embodied as that character.'
Who's legally responsible if a virtual character harms a human? This might
seem esoteric, but it can happen. Any adverse feeling is intensified in a virtual or
augmented environment. There are many instances of cognitive, emotional and
behavioural disturbances after people re-enter the real world.
Soon we'll be able to use extended reality to recreate situations involving dead
loved ones. How will we feel after we return to real life without our beloved?
Extended reality is controlled by a variety of guidelines and laws around the
world, which include respect for the dignity of the people involved, scientific
value and social responsibility. But these laws lack the nuance to deal with
disputes involving the virtual world.
In Grace Chan's dystopian novel Every Version of You, Tao-Yi and her
partner, Navin, spend most of their time inside a hyper-immersive, uber-
consumerist virtual reality known as Gaia. They go to work, socialise and eat
their meals in this digital utopia. At the same time, their ageing bodies are
suspended in pods of goo in cramped apartments, the world a wasteland due to
the ravages of climate change.
A new technology is developed to upload a human brain to Gaia
permanently. Tao-Yi must decide whether to join almost everyone else in this
augmented utopia or remain with her dying mother on earth. According to
some experts, long-term and frequent use of XR might eventually lead people to
prioritise the virtual world over the real one.
Another issue is the large amount of personal data collected during these
experiences, in the same way data miners harvest information from gamers. Do
governments or third parties have a right to know what we do in virtual places?
Pornography and violence will be readily available, and it'll feel more real. This
might have grave social consequences.
It's clear we must address these issues now. 'A particular problem set may be
caused by what we refer to as "superrealism" where elements and even
experiences in virtual or augmented reality may become indistinguishable from
reality,' Slater writes in the Frontiers article. These devices will become as

ubiquitous as smartphones, with people wearing headsets for many hours of the
day and night, as in Chan's speculative fiction.
Alternatively, extended reality could be used to improve society. The 'golden
rule' - known as the ethics of reciprocity - encourages us to treat others the way
we'd like to be treated. Already, virtual and augmented reality can put you into
the body of another person. Someone with pale skin could temporarily become
darker, or an adult could trade places with a child à la the film Freaky Friday.
Dubbed the 'ultimate empathy machine', this technology is being used in
workplaces to conduct diversity training. First-person experiences can raise
awareness and build understanding of others. For example, some devices can
manipulate your field of vision, audio output and surroundings to demonstrate
what it's like to navigate life with a disability. Other programs put you in a 360-
degree video landscape of a refugee camp or a disaster zone.
There's fierce debate among inclusion advocates about whether these
interventions are effective. This includes concerns 'they could replace direct
engagement with the communities being represented', tech policy analyst Elysse
Dick writes for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation in
2021.3 Some evidence exists for the capacity for behavioural change. In one
study from the Stanford Virtual Human Interaction Lab, participants are
presented with exercises designed to elicit empathy for the homeless.
'The results of the study showed that, while short-term emotional responses
were similar across VR and non-VR interventions, the immersive experiences
"led to more positive, longer-lasting attitudes toward the homeless up to two
months after the intervention" than similar, narrative-driven approaches,' Elysse
Dick writes. This is replicated in studies showing people who view 360-degree
video appeals are more likely to make larger contributions to a charity, than
those exposed to traditional advertising.
Could the use of extended reality lead to broader social upheaval? Professor
Courtney Cogburn harnesses the technology for racial justice initiatives. The
2018 immersive film 1000 Cut Journey places the user in the body of a Black man
who encounters racism at various stages of his life. 'It's clear to me that - for
some people at least - we're definitely hitting the mark that I hoped to hit,
which was for White people in particular to come out of the experience feeling

like they don't really understand these experiences perhaps in the ways that they
thought they did,' Professor Cogburn tells Yes! magazine in 2019. 'But feeling
bad or connecting to bad feelings that are being experienced by a group is really
not sufficient for social change.'4
Despite reservations about this tech, it's being fast-tracked in the US to train
police officers for high-risk situations, like sieges. But it's also used for empathy
training. One series puts officers in the body of a person having a mental health
crisis before running a simulated intervention. As the Department of Justice
Office of Community Oriented Policing Services notes: 'Through deeply
immersive VR experiences, police officers can experience life as a community
member in the city they serve.'
In the education sector, virtual reality could reduce implicit bias. Teacher's
Lens creates virtual interactions to identify whether the educator has an
unconscious preference for people of a certain race or gender. In the
psychological sphere, the technology brings phobic people face-to-face with
spiders or sharks, by way of exposure therapy. Extended reality systems are often
employed for data visualisation in architecture and urban planning, as well as
entertainment.
In the 2020s, empathy training is becoming gamified. Digital rights activists
are building games to confront our prejudices. The Choice of the Annotator is an
adventure game that addresses the hidden labour behind machine learning
datasets. Taking the perspective of a gig economy worker, the player experiences
the appalling conditions imposed by the platforms. Talk about turning the tables
on the tech titans!
Another game, Survival of the Best Fit, is conceived by people from four
different countries, alumnae or students from New York University Abu Dhabi.
They want to help people 'better understand how AI works and how it may
affect them, so that they can better demand transparency and accountability in
systems that make more and more decisions for us'.
Meanwhile, language services provider TransPerfect is shining a light on
women behind and in front of the console, many of whom are being erased from
history. 'It was generally thought that only men enjoyed playing and creating
games, and that they were the only ones who "should" do it, too,' staff write on

the TransPerfect website. 'Because of this outdated belief, each aspect of gaming,
from design to marketing, was traditionally based around men's tastes, attitudes
and interests. This left women out of the conversation entirely but didn't
necessarily stop them playing and developing games.'
Some of the women playing pivotal roles include Jade Raymond, who helped
create Assassin's Creed, and Bonnie Ross, a member of the team behind Halo.
Women are interested in gaming, but the money's going mainly to the men. This
sounds similar to the attitudes to women in computing from its inception.
Female streamers are finding success on Twitch and YouTube, and
organisations like I Need Diverse Games are amplifying marginalised voices in
the sector. Still, research shows a whopping 84 per cent of board members in the
top 20 gaming companies are men. Let that sink in for a moment: more than
four out of five. Lawsuits filed against industry giants Activision Blizzard and
Ubisoft reveal women suffer from a hostile work environment, including sexual
harassment and discrimination.
Aside from being an inclusion issue, sidelining women doesn't make sense
financially. The people at the top are effectively setting fire to wads of cash.
Diversity and inclusion aren't buzzwords - they transform business
performance. And the gaming industry is no exception. 'I think that as more
women are in leadership positions and on more boards, it's going to boost
everyone's success,' writes Kayla Madsen Lopez, director of sales at TransPerfect
Gaming Solutions Europe. 'The pie will just get bigger, for everyone.'
Gaming is one of the newest - and fastest-growing - industries in the world.
There's no excuse for its leaders to go down the tired old path of the past. Sadly,
one of our oldest industries is still looking backwards instead of forwards. It
remains a race to the bottom in the automotive sector.

ROAD TO NOWHERE
'I just see this as a race and we need to win, second place is first looser [sic].'
Travis Kalanick, co-founder of Uber
Travis Kalanick is one of the most single-minded developers in Silicon Valley.
Watch Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber to witness his spectacular fall from
grace. Young Travis is cut from the same cloth as Gordon Gekko, the archetypal
1980s businessman with the catchphrase, 'Greed is good'.
After co-founding Uber in 2009, Kalanick works as CEO for seven years
building a global ride-sharing brand. Frankly, there aren't enough pages in this
book to detail exactly what goes wrong. He acts like a dictator, riding roughshod
over government regulations, breaching dozens of workplace laws and engaging
in corporate espionage.
Uber ends up in a ditch due to 'bro culture', misogyny and toxic masculinity.
'Tell me more!' I hear you cry. Well, here are a few of the highlights. One day,
Kalanick jokes to a journalist at GQ magazine that the company should be called
'Boob-er' because of all the female attention he's getting. Executives regularly go
to strip clubs on the corporate account, a practice jokingly referred to as 'Tits on
Travis'.
Engineer Susan Fowler reveals the extent of sexual harassment and rape at the
company, and the CEO's forced to resign. The rise and fall of Travis Kalanick is
the quintessential example of the culture in tech companies focusing on self-
driving vehicles. This sector sits smack bang at the intersection of three male-
dominated industries: transport, manufacturing and technology.
A backlash from Uber drivers, who are living below the minimum wage and
sleeping in their vehicles, leads to the dream of self-driving cars. It ticks all the

boxes. No more dealing with actual humans and their unrealistic dreams of
making ends meet. How dare they expect to be able to put food on the table, or
sleep somewhere other than in their vehicles! Of course, Travis has no interest in
doing business in the usual way.
The secret to his success is a chap by the name of Anthony Levandowski.
According to court documents, Levandowski - a former engineer from Google's
self-driving arm, Waymo - transfers thousands of files before leaving the
company. He then founds a start-up called Otto, which is bought by Uber. In
2018, Uber and Waymo settle their legal dispute, but in 2020 Levandowski is
sentenced to 18 months in prison for stealing trade secrets. He's later pardoned
by President Donald Trump, in his dying days in office. You can't make this stuff
up.
It's fair to say 'bro culture' continues to play a part in the series of disasters
befalling the self-driving vehicle sector since these heady days. Forbes magazine
calls the hype 'an epidemic of questionable assertions'. There are parallels with
the overblown rhetoric about new technology before the AI winter of the late
1970s.
Ford, GM and Tesla are spending billions of dollars and decades in research
and development, repeating the mantra that autonomous cars are 'just around
the bend'. If that's the case, it's a bloody long bend. A 2022 estimate from
consultancy Accenture, reported by Forbes magazine, says there's 'no realistic
chance that full-on self-driving will be available before 2030'. The road is paved
with broken promises, not to mention multiple fatalities.
In 2018, a prototype autonomous vehicle from Uber strikes and kills Elaine
Herzberg while she walks her bicycle across an avenue in Arizona. The state's
governor suspends Uber's ability to test its technology there; two years on, the
company sells its self-driving unit to a start-up called Aurora. Over a period of
ten months, Tesla accounts for 273 of nearly 400 crashes involving driver-assist
systems, according to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Yes, this represents a small percentage of accidents on the road. But surely it's
an indication we should wait until the technology is close to foolproof before
unleashing it on the general public. In the first trial over a fatal accident
involving one of its vehicles, Tesla is held only one per cent responsible for the

death of the teenager. The 18-year-old and his father are apparently 99 per cent
to blame.
The hype surrounding the creation of the Segway in 1999 bears examination.
To say it doesn't end well is the understatement of the year. Engineer and
inventor, Dean Kamen, starts the company to produce two-wheeled, self-
balancing personal transporters for niche markets. All the Segways sold until
2006 are recalled in order to fix a bug that 'could cause the units to reverse,
potentially causing riders to fall off'. Countless people are injured while riding
Segways, often admitted to hospital with traumatic wounds to the head and
face.
Still, the sales pitch continues: Segway 'will be to the car what the car was to
the horse and buggy'. It scooters along before being bought by entrepreneur
Jimi Heselden in 2009. Ten months after buying the company, Heselden dies
after accidentally driving a Segway off a cliff.
Phil Koopman, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, says
there's no robust research showing that self-driving cars will be any safer than
those controlled by accident-prone humans. 'There's nothing I've seen showing
whether AVs (autonomous vehicles) will be safer than humans in the short to
medium term,' he tells The Washington Post.
'Machine learning is brittle, and it struggles with things it hasn't seen before.'
For example, there are unusual scenes the computer has never encountered - like
a woman chasing a duck with a broom, which a Google car apparently
encounters. How does a machine make sense of this? And, importantly, how
does the car respond?
It makes me wonder where the industry would be with more women
involved from its inception. Fatemeh Janatabadi and Alireza Ermagun are
engineering researchers. Their 2021 meta-analysis of 91 peer-reviewed studies on
self-driving vehicles is enlightening, to say the least: women and people in
minority communities are regularly excluded from the research. People with
disabilities and those in racial minorities are only included in 10 and 20 per cent
of the studies, respectively.1
Much of the research is biased as a result of systematic errors like leading or
missing questions, and suggestive information. And an overwhelming 72 per

cent suffer from 'sentiment bias': the positive tone of the title and abstract
overstate the result. The authors say these flaws lead to 'imprecise findings and
unrealistic depictions of acceptance of autonomous vehicles by the public'. To
quote the hip hop group Public Enemy: 'Don't believe the hype.'
This lack of diversity means existing bias in car design is being inserted into
the transport of the future. The 2022 guidelines 'Autonomous Vehicles through
Gender Perspective Glasses', written as part of the Diamond Project by Begoña
Mateo from the Valencia Biomechanical Institute in Spain and co-authors, seeks
to address this issue. They reiterate that cars are more dangerous for women
because they're designed for men.
'The teams of engineers that design both normal and autonomous cars
mostly consist of men,' they write. 'While men use the car for what is usually
direct travel, like moving from home to workplace, women must make several
stops to leave their children at school or day care centers, go shopping, travel to a
medical appointment, etc.'
Remember the Swedish snowplough experiment? This highlights the same
disparity in driver behaviour. Mateo wants autonomous vehicles to take into
account female ergonomics. Things like pregnancy, for example, that directly
affect the design of seats and seatbelts, and temperature tailored to the female
body.
Research shows women tend to desire cars that allow them to undertake
other tasks, like supervising child passengers. As in the home, women are forced
to multitask. Men generally aren't interested in this. Oh, to have the privilege of
doing only one thing at a time!
Another Spanish study, published by MDPI open access journals in 2022,
finds women are more motivated by the promise of greater safety, reduced on-
road errors and fewer 'driving demands' than men.2 Despite men being more
likely to have serious crashes, women are less confident in their ability to avoid
accidents, so they see this as an advantage of autonomous vehicles: 'In this
regard, a reasonably plausible explanation is the fact that, overall, males tend to
believe they perform significantly better than others in different tasks including
vehicle driving, as well as being more optimistic and perceiving themselves as less

prone to get in a crash, particularly when judging their own driving skills.'
That's a burn, right there.
Research consistently shows women and non-white people in general are
around 1.5 times more likely to be concerned about safety than men and white
people overall. In response to these concerns, US consumer organisations are
running a campaign to slow the speed of technological advance. These
organisations are asking that rather than understanding the public as 'consumers
who need to be educated in order to accept the new technology', the car
companies should 'develop a view of the public as citizens who are (or should
be) engaged in the steering of technological directions and futures'. Yep. Don't
act like dictators. And treat consumers like humans. It's really quite simple.
The three most prominent areas of public concern are safety, privacy and data
security. Women are more concerned about privacy and data, presumably due to
the danger of being tracked by an abusive ex-partner. This poses a conundrum.
Women are exposed to sexual harassment, violence and assault in taxis and
Ubers. There are thousands of instances each year, many of which are currently
before the courts.
Self-driving cars could reduce this risk exponentially. But what happens if
autonomous cars are used for ride-share? Governments need to develop
appropriate regulations for autonomous vehicles, instead of allowing rampant
self-regulation. And it has to happen now.
Perhaps the final arbiter will be insurance companies. If they can amortise a
lower risk, they'll adjust premiums accordingly; if the risk is deemed too great,
the industry will crash and burn. One piece of the puzzle could be using hybrid
models in larger vehicles. An autonomous bus could be 'supervised' by a person
running a complementary business, like selling water or food. This would be
appropriate for school buses, with someone on board monitoring student
behaviour. But it still doesn't solve the problem of assault in smaller ride-share
vehicles.
Despite its many drawbacks, this technology is an exciting prospect for
people with disabilities such as vision impairment. In 2021, a young Pakistani
American woman by the name of Sahl Kazi makes a TikTok video about her
wish for a self-driving car. Waymo invites her to its facility in Arizona for a test-

drive. 'Kazi is candid in her enthusiasm for autonomous cars, as she sees them as
an opportunity to eliminate a perceived weakness - namely, that her vision
precludes her from driving,' according to Heather Aijian, public affairs manager
at Waymo.
'Imagine autonomous driving being the thing that demolishes that feeling of
weakness,' Kazi says, 'and instead prompts us to take ownership of the unique
ways [we] adapt and advance the world.' Kazi appears at numerous internal
Waymo meetings as a guest speaker, becoming a public ambassador for
autonomous driving and the disability community.
But the current players still aren't taking full advantage of artificial
intelligence. Industry leaders are 'solving very specific sub-problems within the
massive software stack - or brain of the self-driving car', machine learning expert
Raquel Urtasun tells U of T News in 2021. 'This... requires really complex, time-
consuming manual tuning.' Her company, Waabi, instead uses 'deep learning,
probabilistic inference and complex optimization' to create a new class of
algorithms, the likes of which Urtasun says have never been seen before.3 Enter
the idea of robot trucks. And we're not talking about Bumblebee from
Transformers.
Okay, let's take a step back. There are a lot of tech concepts in Urtasun's
statements. I'll endeavour to translate. Waabi's vehicles learn from small
amounts of data, instead of 'big data'. It's an elegant solution to a complex and
time-consuming problem. The system is also 'interpretable and explainable',
which is crucial for safety verification. Urtasun notes: 'women have to do "ten
times more" than male counterparts to be recognized.' She learned this firsthand
working in the early days of Uber. Now, her hard work is paying off: Waabi is
unveiling its first self-driving truck after raising more than US$100 million in
initial financing.
Unfortunately, no-one is able to solve the old ethical dilemma in the 'trolley
problem' we saw in Chapter 17: should you switch the trolley onto a different
track to save five lives at the expense of one?
People in Europe, Australia and the Americas tend to be more willing than
those in Eastern countries to switch the track, to save more lives. In China, Japan
and Korea, there are far fewer people likely to support this 'morally

questionable' view. So what would an algorithm do? Who would be courageous
enough to program something like this? And would programmers take into
account how local ethics differ across the world?
When we think of smart cities of the future, we visualise robot cars careening
down the streets willy-nilly. But in the near term, it'll be much more controlled.
Currently, these vehicles are mainly used on closed testing tracks, university and
hospital campuses, and big mine sites. The Google subsidiary Waymo is testing
robotic driving systems in 25 cities across the US, but they definitely perform
better in predictable environments.
Our first sight of fully self-driving vehicles will probably be in the form of
smart delivery robots. Serve Robotics, in partnership with Uber Eats, is piloting
next-generation bots in Los Angeles. The bots are capable of working entirely
without human intervention, but a safety operator will be on board during the
pilot. Before you know it, our footpaths will be full of them: annoying, oversized
elephant beetles.
The 'last mile delivery' sector is booming, with US company Nuro launching
third-generation vehicles with external airbags that deploy if they hit a
pedestrian. Hopefully, this doesn't happen too often. Across the Pacific,
autonomous robots from the Alibaba Group deliver millions of parcels across
China. Dubbed Xiaomanlv - 'little donkeys' in Mandarin - these vehicles can
carry 50 packages at a time and travel 100 kilometres on a single charge. The
robots can navigate their way 99.9 per cent of the time without human
intervention, aided by an algorithm that finds the most efficient routes.
The potential for this type of technology is enormous. During the nursing
shortage at the height of the first global Omicron wave in 2021, delivery care
robots in Texas are used to alleviate a shortage of nursing staff. This has the
added benefit of reducing nurse burnout and high turnover rates. There's always
a dark side though, to paraphrase Darth Vader. In future, we'll be dealing with
more robots and fewer people: many warehouse, delivery and gig economy
workers will lose their jobs. The price of convenience might be too high for
society as a whole.
The question of climate change looms large in the self-driving industry.
Marketing spin says these vehicles are good for the planet. One experiment

proves the much-touted clean energy revolution is a mirage. Around a dozen
people in California are given a chauffeur to take them anywhere they want for a
week, replicating the experience of an autonomous vehicle.
Freed from the stress of driving, they end up travelling 83 per cent further
than when they had to drive themselves. This is called the 'Jevons paradox'.
When something becomes cheaper, people find new ways to use it. Self-driving
cars reduce the cost and effort of driving, encouraging people to take trips they
might not have taken previously.
Over time, people with self-driving cars could opt to move farther from the
city, worsening urban sprawl. Whether powered by batteries, petrol or diesel, all
cars produce particle pollution from tyre wear. Manufacturing electric vehicles
and charging batteries require power and materials, expanding the total carbon
footprint.
Corporate consulting giant PwC forecasts that by 2030, 40 per cent of the
kilometres travelled by road will be in self-driving vehicles. Without some sort of
restrictive policy like decongestion pricing, streets could become gridlocked. You
can see it now: owners avoiding parking fees instructing their vehicles to circle
the neighbourhood while they meet up with a friend.
By this stage, you're probably wondering: 'If there are so many arguments
against self-driving cars, why is there a sense of urgency to produce them?' The
answer might surprise you: this industry is being driven by the military. The US
Department of Defense is behind the first Grand Challenge in 2004 for the
autonomous vehicle, to speed up the technology in order to use it in war zones.4
'These challenges helped to create a mindset and research community that a
decade later would render fleets of autonomous cars and other ground vehicles a
near certainty for the first quarter of the twenty-first century,' according to the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency website. Instead of safety, ease or
convenience, the true motivator behind the advance of artificial intelligence is
the military-industrial complex.

MILITARY INTELLIGENCE?
'The US Army wants to turn tanks into AI-powered killing machines.'
Headline, Quartz news site
In the history of humankind, there's no greater battle than between the military
and the English language. Remember 'collateral damage'? 'Friendly fire'? 'Shock
and awe'? Humourist P.J. O'Rourke is responsible for describing a staircase at a
military headquarters as 'a foot impelled, bi-directional, vertical transport asset'
in 2007. But these weasel words have nothing on the contretemps that flare
when the US Army rolls out its ATLAS artificial intelligence system.
Stuart Russell, an AI scientist at Berkeley University who's campaigned for a
ban on lethal autonomous weapons, is appalled. 'The LA in ATLAS stands for
Lethality Automated,' he tells Breaking Defense magazine in 2019.1 This sounds
terrifying in anyone's language. No-one wants death to be automated. In reality,
ATLAS AI is only a nascent project at the time. Which is why nobody bothers
to inform the Pentagon, despite the Defense Department being the organisation
that actually funds each branch of the US armed forces. Oops.
Instead, ATLAS creeps into public consciousness through an article on a
trade website, before exploding onto the global stage under the headline
'KILLING MACHINES' on the news site Quartz. The army does itself a
tremendous disservice by worsening the fear and loathing around the use of
artificial intelligence in warfare. 'No sympathy for the devil,' to quote gonzo
journalist Hunter S. Thompson.
The closest thing to citizen insight into this technology is TV and online
footage of a parkour robot and Spot the Dog, created by artificial intelligence

giant Boston Dynamics. Scratch the surface of the cute and cuddly spin to see
the company's real money-spinner: war.
'Autonomous machines capable of deadly force are increasingly prevalent in
modern warfare, despite numerous ethical concerns,' Professor Frank Pasquale
writes in his 2020 book New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in
the Age of AI. He refers to a film called Slaughterbots, in which college students
are killed by drones released into their classroom. It sounds like a schlocky work
of science fiction.
But Slaughterbots is the work of the Future of Life Institute, an organisation
researching existential threats to humanity. The Terminator is no longer only a
film franchise: Korean engineers are responsible for building a robotic hand
strong enough to crush a beef can, yet gentle enough to clutch an egg.
Yes, I'm burying the lede, as we say in the journalism business. The reason
I'm writing this book is because artificial intelligence is one of the greatest threats
to the continuation of the human race. It's right up there with climate change
and bioweapons. And the pace of innovation is increasing exponentially during
the pandemic. The US Air Force predicts that by 2040, SWAT teams will be
sending mechanical insects equipped with video cameras inside buildings during
hostage situations.
Guess who creates the top insect-shaped weapon? Boston Dynamics. 'The
US-Mexico border will be monitored by a fleet of robotic birds,' the Air Force
claims, 'which may stay aloft for days or weeks without recharging their
batteries.' I don't know about you, but I'm getting Alfred Hitchcock flashbacks:
'Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty into the world. It is
mankind, rather, who insists upon making it difficult for life to exist on this
planet.'
Life-and-death decisions are being made by these machines rather than by
humans. It begs the question: When selecting targets, will autonomous weapons
distinguish between enemy soldiers and ten-year-olds with toy guns? This is
especially difficult when it comes to combatants and civilians in guerrilla or
insurgent warfare, which is proliferating across the globe. Ukraine, anyone?
Moscow is allegedly deploying Kalashnikovs enabled by artificial intelligence,

while Kyiv uses Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones, which are semi-
autonomous.
'The problem is not just that when AI systems err, they err in bulk,' the
author of The Novel of Human Rights, James Dawes, writes. 'It is that when they
err, their makers often don't know why they did and, therefore, how to correct
them.'
A poet of the Enlightenment, Alexander Pope, once wrote: 'To err is human,
to forgive divine.' However, I doubt there'll be much forgiveness when the
robots begin killing our children.
Now, couple this with biased facial recognition technology. Data and
machine learning models already favour white male faces and bodies. What
happens when artificial intelligence becomes 'a rubric for attack and protection?'
asks Assistant Professor Katherine Chandler from Georgetown University.
'Facial recognition systems could make men, regardless of their actual combatant
or civilian status, hyper-visible as targets,' she writes in Does Military AI Have
Gender?
On the other hand, badly trained algorithms mean women of colour could be
misidentified. A group of individuals including women and children whose faces
are partially obscured - say, in Afghanistan or Iraq - may not be identified at all.
This has significant implications in search and rescue missions.
Katherine Chandler is calling for the armed forces to disclose how their
technologies will interact with gender, race, age and ability. Ethical artificial
intelligence expert Dr Catriona Wallace, who's based in Australia, takes this a
step further. Dr Wallace is among a group of experts behind the SurvivAI
website quoted in the introduction to this book: 'So if we've got bias in warfare,
are the drones going to be hunting down the women and children and
minorities? Are they going to be avoiding killing white males?' Dr Wallace is also
concerned about weaponry being 'targeted at the lowest socio-economic people
and favouring the elite'. The message is clear: bias can be deadly.
Then we have the legal quagmire. The Geneva Convention is the thin blue
line separating war from massacre. In name, at least. But who's at fault when a
robot commits a war crime? James Dawes predicts a future where anyone is able
to use unlimited lethal force: 'It is a world where the sort of unavoidable

algorithmic errors that plague even tech giants like Amazon and Google can now
lead to the elimination of whole cities.' There are parallels with the nuclear arms
race. The 1983 movie War Games highlights the inability of machines to
distinguish between reality and fiction. This is troubling when we're talking
about global thermonuclear warfare.
A clue about how this could end is found in Skynet, an artificial general
super-intelligence system from the Terminator media franchise: 'Defense
network computers. New... powerful... hooked into everything, trusted to run it
all. They say it got smart, a new order of intelligence.' Eventually, Skynet
achieves self-awareness and views 'all humans as a threat; not just the ones on the
other side' and decides our fate 'in a microsecond: extermination'. Fun fact: the
fabulous British actor Matt Smith plays the human version of Skynet. Sure, it's a
movie. But the possibility of 'extermination' is terrifying. Put plainly, this will
not end well.
Dr Emma Schleiger from CSIRO's Data61 says weaponised robots and
privacy concerns are her top two issues with artificial intelligence. However,
there are several benefits in bringing technology deeper into the defence space.
'What we hear are worst-case scenarios around Terminator and weaponised AI
and robots ruling the world,' she tells me over Zoom. 'But when we look at some
of the really good things they're doing in the defence space, around the loss of
life and being able to reduce conflict, that's really interesting to me.'
Some argue humans also make mistakes during times of war. Like the time
the US bombed a hospital in Afghanistan, killing 22 people. As it's happening,
hospital workers frantically call their contacts in the US military, begging them
to stop. They call it the 'fog of war': once again, wartime weasel words.
But autonomous weapons kill large numbers of people more quickly than
human soldiers. Battlefields are complex and ever-changing environments. In the
heat of the conflict, artificial intelligence might become overwhelmed. Even if
the technology ends up working well, this is the thin edge of the wedge. The
robots your government deploys on foreign enemies will one day be used on
perceived domestic threats.
We're seeing this in China with the minority Uyghur population. The
government hypes up the threat of 'Muslim terrorism' to detain many Uyghurs

in 're-education camps' and intimidate others with phone inspections and
criminal profiling. In the US, the San Francisco police department wants to be
able to use robots with 'deadly force' while responding to incidents, according to
a policy draft. These robots would be allowed to kill people 'when risk of loss of
life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other
force option available'. Scary stuff indeed.
This reminds me of the infamous quote by Donald Rumsfeld in 2002 about
the 'known knowns', the 'known unknowns', and the 'unknown unknowns'.
Rumsfeld is answering a question about the evidence that Saddam Hussein tried
to supply weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups - if you can call it
'answering'. He fails dismally.
But the same could be said for this fraught area. Policymakers must anticipate
things they know might go wrong (known knowns), things they can speculate
might go wrong (known unknowns) but also things no-one has ever thought of
(unknown unknowns). Crikey. I'm quoting Donald Rumsfeld. This is not on
my 2023 Bingo Card.
One issue is whether combat that reduces human casualties will lead to more
frequent and longer wars because politicians won't need to answer to the public
for as many dead soldiers. 'Drones have enabled the US to maintain a presence in
various occupied zones for far longer than an army would have persisted,' Frank
Pasquale writes in The Guardian in 2020. 'The constant presence of a robotic
watchman, capable of alerting soldiers to any threatening behaviour, is a form of
oppression.'2
He's right, you know. Will the world end up in a perpetual surveillance state,
where oppression is seen as a small price to pay for humanity's survival?
The United Nations recognises that women suffer disproportionately in war
through sexual violence and being forced to flee their homes. They're also
robbed of educational and work opportunities. Taliban, I'm looking at you.
Conflicts and natural disasters 'exacerbate gender inequalities, particularly
against women and girls', to quote the UN's Global Humanitarian Overview.
Research shows the likelihood of peace is higher if more women are included in
peacekeeping forces. However, this isn't happening, despite a Security Council

resolution on the matter. Like a lot of aspects of the UN, it works on paper but
not in practice.
There are parallels with the self-driving vehicle industry: the people making
the decisions in the military, government and technology sectors are
predominantly male. Once again, we see decisions about the lives of women and
girls being dominated by men in power, because of structural discrimination.
Rosa Brooks, a professor at Georgetown Law and former Pentagon official who
worked in Defense at the White House under Barack Obama, investigates how
this phenomenon affects countries dealing with conflict and threat.
In her 2017 book, How Everything Became War and the Military Became
Everything, Brooks says US defence experts are slowly realising development,
governance and aid are just as important as the projection of force. It makes
sense: a world with more real resources has less reason to pursue zero-sum wars.
But this is becoming a battle of ideas, one the hawks - those who favour war as
the only solution - are winning.
Author and lecturer in human geography Ian G.R. Shaw puts it well, calling
the US national security state the 'predator empire': 'Do we not see the ascent of
control over compassion, security over support, capital over care, and war over
welfare? Stopping that ascent should be the primary goal of contemporary
artificial intelligence and robotics policy.' In an attempt at stability, the Pentagon
is supporting peace concerts in Africa and anti-extremist materials in Iraq.
But apparently, this soft diplomacy infuriates those in the military, who
resent peacekeeping efforts. 'You've got these kids, these 30-year-old captains
who've spent their lives learning to drive tanks and shoot people, and they think
they know how to end poverty in Afghanistan, in six months,' a staff member
for the Agency for International Development tells Rosa Brooks, according to a
2016 New York Times review of her book.3
An obvious solution would be prioritising human life above machines. A
missile could be programmed to move slower than optimum speed to collect
more data on the target. It could avert or disengage if civilians are under threat.
But - you guessed it - this would cost more money. And what do we know,
above all else? Uber-capitalism wins the day.

Instead of retrospectively fitting ethics into killing machines (or humans)
perhaps we should try to create a world without wars. Call me a Pollyanna. It
wouldn't be the first time. The way forward is to improve diversity in military
decision-making and peacekeeping. With the election of Joe Biden as US
President in 2020, Rosa Brooks - in her role as co-founder of the Leadership
Council for Women in National Security - advocates for a woman to become
his Secretary of Defense. Biden instead chooses retired General Lloyd Austin.
Part of the problem lies in the pipeline: women in the US have only been
allowed to serve in combat roles since 2015. This is one of the reasons there are
so few females in senior military positions. Australia lifted the 'combat bar' in
2013.4 Which is remarkable, given the attitude of the likes of former SAS
Commander Brigadier Jim Wallace, who in 2011 explained to ABC Radio his
objection to allowing women on the frontline. And it's a well-considered
argument, indeed. 'I'm sitting here at breakfast, my wife just handed me a jar
that she couldn't open and I opened it,' he tells the ABC. 'You know, I rest my
case.'
It seems critical thinking is not a prerequisite for reaching the senior ranks of
the Australian armed forces. Brigadier Jim Wallace continues to shove his foot
further into his mouth. 'They've got to be able to carry specific weights...
women are not designed to carry these weights. They've got a lot of other
strengths. I'd hate to give birth to a child.' Apparently, we're all just breeders;
characters in The Handmaid's Tale.
A similar attitude exists in the US. 'If it took decades for a sizeable pool of
highly qualified women to emerge as potential senior Pentagon leaders, that's no
accident,' Rosa Brooks writes in the Times in 2020.5 These laws and policies
aren't only unfair to women: they diminish the ability to develop smart, effective
security policies. Organisations with gender-diverse teams outperform those
under male-dominated leadership. Surely it would be wise to have more
collaboration, less groupthink, and fewer acts of recklessness in military policy.
Brooks nails it towards the end of her searing piece: 'The United States faces
national security problems ranging from the pandemic to climate change,
refugee crises and the rise of near-peer competitors such as China. These

complex and interconnected issues require fresh approaches, not a reversion to
old modes of thinking about defense policy.'
However, one piece of old thinking turns out to be right. In 1961, Dwight
Eisenhower, a Republican president and former general, warns against the rise of
the 'Military-Industrial Complex'. His comments show how far the so-called
Grand Old Party has since moved to the Right. This debate is now moving
beyond political ideology. Autonomous weapon systems may have killed people
earlier than the war in Ukraine, according to a United Nations Security Council
report on the civil war in Libya. An incident in 2020 might have marked the
beginning of a new arms race.
So what does the UN do in response? Well, at the next Convention on
Certain Conventional Weapons, member states fail to reach consensus on a ban,
due to opposition from several countries including the US and Russia. The next
meeting? 2026. Apparently, there's no urgent need to try to save the human race.
'Much of global capitalism has invested a lot in the industrial-military
complex, so the incentives to ban killer robots are actually limited for those who
benefit the most,' AI futurist Michael Spencer writes. He warns the period
leading up to 2040 will be 'one of the most dangerous in the history of
humanity'. It makes sense: no-one is overseeing the robots being unleashed onto
battlefields. Spencer doesn't mince his words. 'Men with their toys and the
relentless pressure for greater profits could end us as a civilization.' Boom! A big
boom that could kill us all.
Some of the arguments heard at these forums in support of autonomous
weapons are spurious. It's claimed violence perpetrated by machines could be
less lethal and more controlled. This relies on machines being trained to make
'rational' decisions. For the sake of amusement, let's break this down. Robots are
being fed data by biased humans. They continue to learn in the same way as
chatbot Tay did on Twitter. Suddenly, they're expected to become rational? Give
me a break! Frankly, this argument sounds like one from the 1997 Australian
film The Castle: 'It's the vibe of the thing, your Honour.'
Suffice it to say, there are practical difficulties in coding ethics into killer
robots, not least of which is the 'trolley problem' mentioned in chapters 17 and
22. There are also concerns about how a machine calculates what is a

'proportional' response. It's not proportional for a machine to kill the human
attacking it, because the robot can't die. In this David and Goliath battle, we're
fighting with our hands tied behind our backs.
Ethics are being sacrificed as world powers endeavour to keep pace with one
another. Microsoft and Amazon work closely with the Pentagon. What's their
primary motive? Profit.
To find out about the kind of world we're leaving for the next generation, we
need to follow the money.

WORKER BEES
'Radical for capitalism.'
Ayn Rand
The denizens of Silicon Valley are beholden to a cult. It's not Jonestown,
although they're definitely drinking the Kool-Aid. The pervasive ideology is
often attributed to writer Ayn Rand. She described Objectivism as 'the concept
of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life,
with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only
absolute'. Seems selfish, I reckon. Despite being classified as a conservative, Rand
denounced libertarianism.
But this memo must've got lost on its way to the Valley, because Rand is still
one of its most popular philosophers. Tech-heads embrace extreme
libertarianism in their feverish race for wealth. 'Disruption of any kind is seen as
good; government on the whole as bad,' Toby Walsh explains in his 2018 book,
2062: The World that AI Made. Walsh, who's based in Sydney, is one of the
world's leading researchers on artificial intelligence.
The pandemic destroys my dreams of travelling to Silicon Valley itself.
Instead, I speak to Toby and others who are privy to the inner circle to get a
sense of the culture of the place. (In case you're wondering, the translation
software otter.ai gets his name right.)
'You know, white male people like me are the masters of those machines, and
the machine does everything perfectly for you,' Toby tells me. 'I think for many
years I was seduced by this idea that I knew I had this perfect, perfect world that
I can manipulate.'

I can understand the lure of a world in which you have ultimate control over
all you create. The otherworldly profit margins are merely a bonus. The only
businesses with wider margins are illegal. So who's making all this money?
Principally, it's men from wealthy parts of the US and Asia. Forbes magazine
reports in 2022 that tech is the third-most lucrative industry for billionaires in
the world.
At the time of writing, Elon Musk is the richest individual in the world with
a net worth of US$196.5 billion. This is the guy who spends almost a million
dollars on a 'submarine' car: 'It was amazing as a little kid in South Africa to
watch James Bond in The Spy Who Loved Me drive his Lotus Esprit off a pier,
press a button and have it transform into a submarine underwater,' Musk says in
a statement to the car website Jalopnik. 'I was disappointed to learn that it can't
actually transform.'
Seriously, a person with that much money could use it to address climate
change or reduce global poverty. But the big baby wants a car he can drive
underwater. Truly, I despair. And don't get me started on his 2022 acquisition of
Twitter.
I dive into The Real-Time Billionaires List on the Forbes magazine website.1
Wannabe astronaut and founder of Amazon Jeff Bezos is the second-richest
person in the world with US$122.9 billion. Larry Ellison, of Oracle, rakes in a
tidy US$114.3 billion. Bill Gates of Microsoft follows closely behind, worth
US$106.7 billion. Computer scientist Larry Page of Alphabet - Google's parent
company - is sitting at US$82.3 billion. Michael Dell of Dell Technologies
languishes at US$52.4 billion. Ma Huateng, CEO of Tencent, is next, with
US$39.6 billion derived from the instant messaging company. William Lei Ding
from Netease has a net worth of US$27.8 billion. Shiv Nadar, the founder and
chair of HCL Technologies, is worth US$25.6 billion. The only woman in the
Top 15 is L'Oreal's Francoise Bettencourt Meyers and her family with a
combined net worth of US$82.9 billion. The first individual female tech
billionaire on the list is Mackenzie Scott of Amazon, ranking 54th with a
fortune valued at US$26.8 billion - tens of billions below her male
contemporaries.

For context, Croesus is famed as the richest man in ancient Rome, worth an
estimated US$13.7 billion in today's money. In 1913, J.D. Rockefeller topped
out at US$24.7 billion, in 2021 dollars adjusted for inflation. So these tech dudes
are really rocking some coin. Or, as Toby Walsh puts it, 'Most of them sit on
huge cash mountains'.
It's clear inequality worsens during the pandemic: the ten richest people on
earth double their wealth between March 2020 and November 2021. Everyone
else loses money over the same period. This figure is from an Oxfam report aptly
named 'Inequality Kills': 'A new billionaire was created every 26 hours since the
beginning of the pandemic - with those in tech leading the way.'
The worldwide market for artificial intelligence, valued at US$68.8 billion in
2022, is projected to reach US$459.3 billion by 2030, according to the
International Trade Authority's Global Artificial Intelligence Industry Report.2
For maths-minded readers, that's a compound annual growth rate of 26.8 per
cent. China is forecast to grow at around 31.1 per cent for the same period.
These are very large numbers. My head's starting to spin. Let's examine what this
means for people living outside Silicon Valley: i.e., the rest of us poor suckers.
Artificial intelligence may eliminate 85 million jobs and create 97 million
new ones by 2025, if forecasts by the World Economic Forum are correct. This is
good, right? Wrong. There's no evidence they'll be equivalent, well-paid or
secure jobs. Which groups will miss out? Human Resources and middle
management roles will become automated at some stage during the 2030s. This
means most of us will be managed by an algorithm, without any recourse to
complain to a human. Even if there is human oversight, this leaves us in an
endless loop of filling out automated forms in order to continue working. We all
know how frustrating this is.
Writing in the Harvard Business Review, futurist Mike Walsh imagines what
lies ahead: 'There are a million ways that algorithms in the hands of bad
managers could do more harm than good: How about using an algorithm to set
your work rosters so that the number of hours is just below the legal threshold
for full-time employment? Or automatically sending emails to people when they
are more than five minutes late to work?' Walsh also details dystopian measures,
like using sensors to make sure warehouse workers are moving quickly enough,

and changing the office lighting so employees think the afternoon is actually the
morning.
Workplace surveillance using artificial intelligence is increasing around the
world. Amazon has patents to manufacture wristbands, designed to guide the
movements of warehouse workers. Vibrations nudge them into working harder
and faster, like hamsters on a perpetually spinning wheel. According to Mike
Walsh, IBM is applying for a patent for devices that track workers' pupil dilation
and facial expressions. Data on employees' sleep quality prompts the deployment
of drones to deliver caffeinated liquid, so productivity isn't disturbed by coffee
breaks. While I'd love a drone to deliver me a cuppa, this level of oversight is,
frankly, terrifying. What's next? Catheters operated by artificial intelligence, so
we don't leave the desk for a toilet break?
In 2019 the International Monetary Fund projects 11 per cent of jobs held by
women are 'at risk of elimination as a result of AI and other digital
technologies'.3 Smaller subsequent studies suggest the risk of job transformation
for women may be as high as 44-50 per cent. The three occupations with the
largest projected declines in employment are cashiers, administrative assistants
and executive secretaries, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US.
Here's one example, provided by co-founder of the Women Leading in AI
Network, Ivana Bartoletti, writing in The Guardian in 2018: three out of four
shop cashiers are female; 97 per cent are expected to lose their roles due to
automation.
Overall, the biggest losers will be women, countries in the global south, and
workers who do menial jobs - effectively human computers, doing what
machines can't do. Yet.
'Computers' is the original term for people doing mathematical calculations
in scientific fields including astronomy, meteorology and naval navigation.
Women are 'allowed' to perform this work during World War I, while the fellas
are away. But once money comes into the sector, women are pushed aside. We're
only viewed as worthy of menial work.
The racist, misogynistic and colonial structures of the first Industrial
Revolution are being scaled up in the fourth. Like the early weavers, coders and
kilo-girls, the 'piecework' of women and migrant workers is hidden, their

backbreaking labour unrecognised and poorly compensated. The overwhelming
majority of them are gig workers, who are exposed to mental stress and vicarious
trauma. It's being said we're witnessing the rise of a 'cyber-proletariat'.
People living in developing countries are structurally and systemically
excluded from the top levels of the tech sector because of a lack of educational
pathways. As a consequence, these workers will only be able to do unskilled jobs
with no road to promotion, and little input in decision-making. For many of
them, it's the only way out of poverty. Worsening this situation is the deep
disparity between metropolitan and rural areas. In Peru, for example, one-third
of women in the cities complete their higher education; in the regions, the
percentage drops to just 6.2 per cent, according to the not-for-profit
organisation Laboratoria.
In 2014, three rookie entrepreneurs try to start a web development agency in
Lima. But they hit an unexpected hurdle. 'Technology builders were apparently
a rare breed, and women in the tech space seemed to be on their way to
extinction,' Mariana Costa Checa tells me. She's the co-founder of Laboratoria,
which teaches women aged 18 to 28 to code before connecting them with
quality jobs in the tech sector.
'We foster a community of alumnae where they support each other's growth
as future leaders in the technology sector,' Costa Checa says. One success story is
Denisse Peralta from the third cohort in Guadalajara, who works as a software
engineer at AstraZeneca. Laboratoria has now expanded to Chile, Mexico, Brazil
and Colombia, with more than 2000 female graduates.
But these examples are few and far between. Overwhelmingly, the tech sector
is built on unpaid labour, which is often female. There's an old saying: if you're
not paying for a product, you are the product. Every time you play a game
online, post a photo on social media, or fill out a survey, you're supplying a
valuable commodity to these companies. But do we get a pat on the back? A
small sum in compensation? Or even a 'thank you'?
We're feeding this insatiable beast, creating millions of underpaid jobs. In her
2020 book An Artificial Revolution: On Power Politics and AI, Ivana Bartoletti
writes about a new 'category' of work. People are being paid pennies to go

through piles of our data, labelling it for use in algorithms. Dangerous
'asymmetries of power' underpin this digital ecosystem.
An allegory can be found in the tragic tale of Tian Yu. At the age of 17, she's
hired as an Apple iPad assembly worker at Foxconn in Shenzhen. Thirty-seven
days after taking the job, Yu tries to take her own life by jumping from the
fourth floor of her factory dormitory. In the same year, 2010, 15 workers
attempt suicide at the facility and 10 die. Yu survives but spends 12 days in a
coma: she's now paralysed from the waist down.
At Foxconn, the employee handbook urges: 'Hurry towards your finest
dream, pursue a magnificent life.' Yu tells interviewers about the working
conditions: 12 hours a day, six days a week; toilet breaks restricted; no training
whatsoever. However, if you make a mistake, you're loudly reprimanded.
Foxconn eventually pays Yu a one-off 'humanitarian payment' of A$32,000
to help her go home. 'It was as if they were buying and selling a thing,' her father
says. In the same year Apple CEO, Tim Cook, is paid US$4 million. Foxconn
tries to handle the crisis by requiring employees to sign a waiver absolving the
company of responsibility if they kill themselves.
Following a backlash, they retract this document. Instead, the company
decides to string nets under the dorm windows, according to an article in The
Guardian. 'Workers of the world, unite!' indeed. I guess they ignore that bit of
The Communist Manifesto. Marx would be rolling in his grave.
The culture fuelling the extraordinary rise of China's tech factories is known
by the number 996. This means most employees work from 9 am to 9 pm six
days a week, according to Quartz magazine. In 2019, Chinese tech workers
launch the online project 996.ICU, to protest against their working hours and
conditions. ICU is a reference to the intensive care unit they expect to end up in
as a result of the long hours. The Quartz article reports 'souring public
sentiment' toward Chinese tech companies, and some are changing their
operating practices. However, while employees would clearly benefit from fewer
hours, many depend on the overtime payments to survive.
There's another term used for the work done by Yu and her downtrodden
colleagues: ghost work. This is reminiscent of the work done by women over the
centuries, particularly the 'ghosts in the machine' in the early days of computing.

In the 2013 movie Snowpiercer, a post-apocalyptic world is circumnavigated by a
never-stopping train. The engine is powered by kidnapped child slaves in the
'poor' section, separated from the wealthy passengers. Humanity has a long
history of hiding inconvenient truths. If this is the first time you're reading
about such exploitation, it's not your fault. The human labour powering digital
software is hidden deliberately.
In their 2019 book, Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a
New Global Underclass, anthropologist Mary L. Gray and computer scientist
Siddharth Suri write: 'From labeling data to transcribing audio to content
moderation, ghost work happens when tech companies assign tasks to an unseen
and unacknowledged workforce (that has few, if any, labor protections), rather
than full-time workers.'
During every automation throughout history, from textiles to coding,
'finishing tasks' are done by hand. Computer automation requires 'algorithmic
piecework', in which payment is set by the amount of work rather than the
hours. Ghost work is thriving as tech companies outsource labour around the
world to reduce costs. This is called the 'paradox of the automation's last mile' -
the 'automation' is never fully automated.
Developers use on-demand labour platforms to hire casual workers, who are
required to perform repetitive tasks. Many are women seeking flexible hours at
home to combine with caring responsibilities. Others are immigrants, people
with disabilities or low-skilled workers who can't afford to pay for courses,
instead seeking out experience. Moderators are required to monitor
pornographic, violent, racist, homophobic, transphobic and misogynistic
content which creates an 'ecosystem of harm', in the words of Mary L. Gray and
Siddharth Suri.
Of course, this work is rarely unionised or insured. Increasingly, shifts are also
assigned by artificial intelligence: the robots become the masters. AI decides who
gets a shift and who doesn't. Workers feel the need to be on-call 24/7 so they
don't miss out. People around the world bid for job opportunities, driving down
wages and conditions in a race to the bottom.
Tech companies alienate content moderators from one another, to prevent
organising and whistleblowing. The industry is hostile to organised labour.

Some of the worst conditions are found in machine learning, which is
particularly data-hungry. 'Manually labelling each image, text, audio, etc., in
large datasets is tedious and a labour-intensive process,' Meeta Ramnani writes
in Analytics India Magazine in 2022. 'Hence, many companies choose not to
handle data labelling and use specialised software.'4
But the pre-built solutions don't often meet the tech companies' needs. So
they turn to labour-hire platforms to outsource this work. 'But companies fail to
focus on the ethical considerations around the processes,' Ramnani writes. Yep.
It's the salt mines again.
The market for data collection and labelling is likely to grow to US$8.2
billion by 2028, according to market research company Grand View Research.
Consequently, more 'crowd workers' will be exploited. Around 94 per cent of
them have work rejected or aren't paid for work already done. 'But the requesters
retain full rights over the data they receive,' Ramnani says. The workers end up
with nothing. This is wage theft, writ large.
Most countries don't have regulations around crowd work, and the
minimum wage doesn't apply because they're independent contractors. This is
exacerbated by geography. Overly developed countries are in the best positions to
profit from artificial intelligence, while those in sub-Saharan Africa and
Southeast Asia provide cheap labour. Appallingly, technology companies use the
inclusion of underpaid workers to claim their workforce is diverse. This is called
'participation-washing': using a person of colour to lend an organisation moral
legitimacy. What a disgraceful practice.
'While data labeling is not as physically intensive as traditional factory labor,
workers report the pace and volume of their tasks as 'mentally exhausting' and
'monotonous' due to the strict requirements needed for labeling images, videos,
and audio to client specifications,' Chan and co-authors point out in their 2021
paper, 'The Limits of Global Inclusion in AI Development'.5 Sure, they're not
digging ditches. But this is tough work.
People who label data are detached from the rest of the machine learning
workforce. They have scant idea about the purpose of their labour - only
building 'parts' of a product - and rarely get the satisfaction of seeing it created.
Nor do they share in the obscene profits. In a way, they're being treated like mere

machines with no heart or soul. Think of Winston Smith in George Orwell's
1984: working away at the Ministry of Truth in a never-ending cycle of
'corrections' with no ability to question the end result.
The philosophy underpinning this entire industry is white supremacy. The
development of artificial intelligence has happened in the global north because
of readily available capital, cashed-up research institutions and technical
infrastructure. It's impossible to unpick this from the history of colonial
exploitation of the global south, when European states plundered labour.
AI companies further exploit those from the global south when compiling
their databases. People either aren't paid - or are paid a pittance - for agreeing to
share information, images or videos. This data is interpreted by people
unfamiliar with, and perhaps insensitive to, these cultures. The result? Racial
stereotypes continue to be codified. It's a vicious cycle. This is an ugly problem
at the intersection of radical capitalism, colonialism and the technological
revolution.
At the very least, these companies should provide grassroots resources and
education to Indigenous groups in developing countries, so they can participate
fully in the sector. They should also offer compensation. 'As the development of
artificial intelligence continues to progress across the world, the exclusion of
those from communities most likely to bear the brunt of algorithmic inequity
only stands to worsen,' Chan and co-authors contend.
Over the centuries, automation moves compensation from worker bees to
business owners, who enjoy higher profits with lower-cost labour. Regardless of
the relative wealth of one hemisphere over the other, there's one consistent
factor that determines who rises to the top of the pile, and who remains at the
bottom. It raises the same question we ask almost every time we see a panel
discussion at a conference about technology: where are all the women?

CRACKING THE CODE
'It's not really about asking for the raise but knowing and having faith that the
system will actually give you the right raises as you go along.'
Satya Nadella, former CEO of Microsoft
It's 2014 and Satya Nadella is flying high as head of Microsoft. During an event,
he's asked what women should do if they feel uncomfortable about requesting a
pay increase. Bear in mind the question comes during the Grace Hopper
Conference, which celebrates women in computing. His answer about having
faith in the system - which seems aimed at deterring women from daring to ask
for a raise - sparks a global outcry.
'That's good karma. It will come back,' Nadella says. 'That's the kind of
person that I want to trust.' So sit back, ladies, and wait for a billionaire to deign
to reward you for your toil! Like the generations of women before you, crawling
in and out of computers for a pittance.
As a middle-aged woman in employment since the age of 15, I can tell you
this is not the way to get ahead in the workplace. Being the 'good girl' only ends
in tears. 'Faith', 'karma' and 'trust' won't overcome entrenched bias and
discrimination within hierarchical structures. It's called the patriarchy. To be
fair, Satya Nadella later apologises, admitting he got it 'completely wrong'. But it
makes you wonder: if a woman talks about unconscious bias in a forest, does
anybody hear? Calling out this stuff all the time is exhausting.
The problem isn't a lack of qualifications: women in artificial intelligence
generally have higher levels of formal education than men. The 'achievement
gap' is even greater in the senior ranks. There's evidence of 'persistent structural
inequality in the data science and AI fields, with the career trajectories of data

and AI professionals differentiated by gender', postdoctoral research fellow Dr
Erin Lorelie Young writes for the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Israel in 2021.
'Women are more likely than men to occupy a job associated with less status and
pay in the data and AI talent pool, usually within analytics, data preparation and
exploration, rather than the more prestigious jobs in engineering and machine
learning.'
In a 2020 report, the World Economic Forum estimates women make up
roughly a quarter of the workforce in artificial intelligence.1 Other studies reveal
only 10 to 15 per cent of machine learning researchers in the main technology
companies are female. While the percentage of women in the US labour force is
almost half, it's notably lower in the tech sector: female employees make up
between 29 and 45 per cent of employees at the largest companies. Looking at
actual technical jobs, the figure drops to one in four. This matters because tech
roles are the highest paid, with an added bonus: there's a clear path to
management.
Google's glossy Diversity Annual Report 2022 contains inspiring images of
'Black+ and Latinx+' employees. The headline boasts: 'Our best year yet for
hiring women globally.' But the increases are incremental, within the margin for
error. Currently, only around 9 per cent of Google workers are Black, with a
similar percentage Latinx. Let's interrogate this for a moment.
Despite being aware of the systemic bias existing within software, such as the
COMPAS program profiling and incarcerating innocent Black people since
2016, tech firms are still failing to seriously address the issue of bias within their
own organisations. Frankly, this is negligent to the point of being criminal.
'We know we have a long road ahead', the Google report says. That's the
understatement of the century. Men outnumber women almost two to one in
Google workplaces across the globe.
Maybe I'm being snarky. After all, in one year alone this company invests
US$50 million in historically Black colleges and universities. In another year, it
ploughs US$55 million into economic empowerment programs for women and
girls around the world. But this smells like spin.
You only have to look at the balance sheet to see the true story: Google
records a net worth of US$1853 billion in 2022. Yep - billion. Diversity

initiatives are barely a drop in this vast ocean. Disappointingly, it takes until
2019 for this supposedly progressive organisation to include 'LGBTQI+, people
with disabilities, military and veterans, and non-binary Googlers' in the
Diversity Annual Report.
Where do we sit in Australia? 'Aboriginal people have been consciously and
preconsciously told they can't do science, that science isn't for them, and
predominantly women have as well, and all minorities,' Corey Tutt, founder of
DeadlyScience, tells me during our Zoom interview. 'And the thing for us is that
we need to decolonise the lab coat. It's silly to think middle-aged white fellas are
the only people that can wear lab coats. Lab coats can be worn by anyone.'
DeadlyScience provides early reading materials to remote schools to try to
redress this imbalance.
'If the only books we're sending are of Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison,
and not a great woman in science, or great Black people in science, or people of
colour, then where do they fit in the picture?' Tutt asks.
This reminds me of the tremendous breakthrough the late actor Nichelle
Nichols made by appearing as the first Black woman in a lead role on TV in the
series Star Trek.
'In Romania nobody told me I wasn't meant to be a scientist,' Doina Precup
from Google DeepMind tells the 2021 Canadian Celebration of Women in
Science. 'My grandmother was a mathematician and my mother was a computer
scientist. I didn't know I shouldn't do computer science until I came to the
US.'2
Our Chief Scientist, Dr Cathy Foley, makes a salient point about the subjects
women choose to study in Australia, during her 2021 Helen Williams Oration.
'The latest STEM Equity Monitor shows that more than a third of men in
tertiary education are studying STEM qualifications; areas related to maths, or
the sciences or engineering - excluding health,' Dr Foley says. Women are
overwhelmingly represented in the caring streams, studying health, veterinary
and environmental science.
Overall, women comprise almost 30 per cent of employment in technology in
Australia. Based on current trends, it'll take 66 years for technology occupations
to reach a level of female participation close to parity, according to Deloitte

Access Economics' report, 'Australia's Digital Pulse 2021'. This is a national
disgrace.
Modelling for the report finds increasing diversity '... would grow Australia's
economy by $1.8 billion each year on average, over the next 20 years. This
amounts to an $11 billion opportunity for Australia's economy in net present
value (NPV) terms. In employment terms, it could create almost 5000 full-time
equivalent (FTE) jobs on average each year.' Reports like this tend to motivate
government ministers, who love having money waved in their faces. It aligns
with the mantra of 'jobs and growth'. In 2021, the response from the Morrison
federal government is to lower university fees for STEM subjects and offer grants
to entice women into the sector.
But an investigation by the Australian Financial Review uncovers many
deterrents, including job insecurity, sexism, low workplace morale, fatigue, the
gaping gender pay gap, dissatisfaction with remuneration rates, and
deprofessionalisation within the industry. It seems the tech sector has a similar
culture to the media in the 1980s and 90s. In my memoir, The Good Girl
Stripped Bare, I write about the exodus of women from TV, radio and
newspaper jobs because of the relentless sexism and discrimination.
In 2022, the federal Minister for Industry and Science Ed Husic announces a
review to improve the pathways for women and girls. 'Women remain
chronically underrepresented in STEM, making up only 16% of people with
STEM qualifications,' the minister says. 'Of First Nations people, only half a per
cent hold university-level STEM qualifications.' Change can't come soon
enough.
Around 90 per cent of coding and engineering in artificial intelligence is still
done by men. Remember how much of the coding in the 1940s-60s was done
by women? Well, it appears we're going backwards. This nugget of information
comes from the founder of Flamingo AI - and the brains behind SurvivAI - Dr
Catriona Wallace. She tells me about her path to a career in technology, after
working as a police officer in Kings Cross.
'I developed an interest in Organisational Behaviour,' she says. 'My thesis was
on the role technology plays in substituting for human leadership.' In the AI
sector, she soon becomes aware of unconscionable behaviour: 'Because we were

dealing with large Fortune 100 financial services companies, we started analysing
some of the data that they were using to train algorithms. And we started to see
that the data was all historical data. And it wasn't transformed. It wasn't cleaned.
It wasn't analysed in order to see whether there were skews or biases in there.'
The responsibility comes back to the companies selling these large datasets.
Dr Wallace shares an example from schools in the UK. 'During COVID, the
equivalent of Year 12 students couldn't be sitting their exams in the normal way,
so they used an algorithm to determine the grades that the students would get,'
she says. 'Traditional historical data was used to train the algorithms, and they
gave grades to students which were all way off. Again, those students from lower
socio-economic groups had much poorer grades than what they expected, and
those from higher socio-economic groups had much higher grades. And it was a
big outcry, the whole thing got shut down.'
Another example involves teachers rather than students. Over a period of
four years, teachers in Houston are evaluated by a data-driven algorithm called
the Educational Value-Added Assessment System. This decides which teachers
get bonuses, are sanctioned for poor scores or are actually fired. 'Obviously,
something like that is going to really affect low socio-economic groups,' Dr
Emma Schleiger from CSIRO's Data61 tells me. 'Schoolteachers with
classrooms of students that don't have all of those opportunities at other schools
could do poorly on a standardised test. But that doesn't mean the teacher is
doing poorly.'
If you think this is unfair, it gets worse: there's no recourse. Teachers are
unable to challenge the decisions or ask for an explanation. The algorithm's
codes are trade secrets owned by a third party. Following a lengthy lawsuit, a
federal judge rules this denies teachers their constitutional rights. We'll see more
of these cases as workers and unions take action over the use of impenetrable
artificial intelligence.
Regardless of these systemic failures, Dr Wallace says artificial intelligence will
continue to flourish because it's cost-effective. This means bias will become
further entrenched. From there, it becomes a chain of events: fewer than 2.8 per
cent of all venture capital goes into women-led businesses. 'And so even a very

small fraction of the fraction would go to women-led AI businesses,' according
to Dr Wallace.
How we're going to improve this situation remains a challenge. 'A riddle,
wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma,' to quote Winston Churchill. Repeated
analyses of the pipeline show blockages from start to finish, like a backed-up
portaloo at a barbecue meat festival.
It begins with children from wealthier families attending fancypants private
schools. 'There's this term that I think was coined a few years ago about how
Silicon Valley tech companies are not meritocracies, but "mirrortocracies", so
you're hiring people who have similar credentials to you, had the same sort of
schooling,' Dr Joy Lisi Rankin from the AI Now Institute tells Yahoo!Finance in
2021. 'But that doesn't necessarily mean they're more qualified.' In Australia, we
call it the 'old school tie'.3
When women are employed in technology organisations, structural inequity
leads to high turnover and attrition rates. Even after #MeToo, around one in two
women are sexually harassed, based on figures from the not-for-profit
organisation Women Who Tech. A startling 44 per cent of these are founders.
It's no wonder women and people from marginalised communities leave to
pursue other careers.
'I have certainly been the only woman on my team before, and the scrutiny of
how that feels, and the microaggressions really grate on you, where you find your
colleague is making substantially more than you,' the founder of Women in
Voice, Dr Joan Palmiter Bajorek, says via Zoom. 'It's the near constant barrage of
frustration, and potentially feeling alone.' She evokes the Beatles to explain how
this eats away at women in the industry: 'I've actually thought about this climate
like the "Eleanor Rigby" effect, or something. It's like all the lonely people.'
Australia's Chief Scientist, Dr Cathy Foley, expands on this theme in the
Helen Williams Oration. 'I remember trying to fit in when I studied physics at
university, and just be one of the boys in what was a pretty male-dominated
environment,' Dr Foley says. After wearing a dress on her first day at CSIRO as
the only female research scientist, she quickly reverts to trousers to be part of the
team. Dr Foley's formula for removing 'blockages from the pipeline' includes

encouraging girls into STEM subjects, improving the visibility of science careers
and raising the profile of female role models.
There's a suite of wonderful programs around the world including Girls
Who Code, AI4All, Girls in AI, Black Girls Code, Young Women Leaders in
Artificial Intelligence and Girl Geek Academy. These certainly give women a leg-
up. But the trick is to keep them in the sector by supporting their progression
through to leadership. Many early- and mid-career researchers leave because of
the lack of flexible and part-time work, and plateauing due to non-linear career
paths. These qualified, experienced and highly intelligent women often choose
more family-friendly roles. It's devastating to witness this brain drain. Whatever
happened to Australia being the 'clever country'?
One of the leading national research centres - the Walter and Eliza Hall
Institute - is proactive on equity. It boasts comprehensive measures to support
promotions and career breaks, including a childcare centre adjacent to its
laboratories.
Gemaker is another example of a progressive company. Since 2011, every staff
member has been able to work remotely and flexibly at the technology
commercialisation firm. Gemaker has also provided career pathways for many of
the female researchers axed from universities during the years of the Morrison
government.
On a broader scale, Australia's STEM Returners program mentors skilled
women back into the workforce. At the time of writing, women are heading the
Australian Research Council, the National Health and Medical Research
Council and Science & Technology Australia, and both the CSIRO Chief
Scientist and the Defence Chief Scientist are female.
One of the many light-bulb moments in Dr Foley's speech is a lesser-
discussed form of discrimination, against women aged beyond their mid-forties.
We tend to become invisible. Or in my case, the late thirties, when I'm deemed
to be 'too long in the tooth' for television. To quote the boss, 'Maybe you
should consider radio?' I must have a 'good head for it', to quote an old joke.
I'm reminded of comedian Amy Schumer's Last Fuckable Day sketch,
starring Tina Fey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Patricia Arquette. Schumer stumbles
upon these doyennes of film and TV enjoying a picnic. They're commiserating

about reaching an age at which women are no longer cast in bankable
Hollywood roles. This hilarious clip targets the entertainment industry for its
blatant disregard for older women, but it also acts as a metaphor for other
industries.
Women in this age group could become powerful leaders in STEM, a
'valuable pool' to draw from during the current skills shortage. Dr Foley distils
the major issue as menopause: 'Half the population goes through menopause.
And it's not a moment in time - it's a process that takes some years. But there is
surprisingly little research relating to the impact of menopause on women's
careers in Australia.' A British parliamentary inquiry notes more than a million
women in the UK leave employment because of the symptoms. Many are in the
process of launching employment discrimination cases.
Speaking of 'the change', it's a-comin'. Although women make up only 20
per cent of Silicon Valley's workforce, they're shaping the future. Stanford
professor and artificial intelligence entrepreneur Daphne Koller tells Vogue
magazine in 2019: 'A lot of people think that technical fields and especially
computing are this kind of geeky thing where people go off and do these obscure
mathematical formulas that have no relevance to anything... [but] you can help
fishermen in South Africa figure out where to sell their fish or use computing as
we're doing to discover new drugs. There are just so many ways now to have a
tremendous impact on society.'
During a panel discussion I facilitate for International Women's Day 2022,
doctoral researcher Manika Saha from Monash University speaks eloquently
about the intersection with climate change, known as the 'eco-gender gap'. For
example, underpaid women farmers in Bangladesh suffer an added penalty,
because every natural disaster worsens the incidence of domestic violence and
sexual assault.
'A rich body of literature shows Information and Communication
Technologies can contribute to improving women's condition in developing
countries,' Saha and co-authors write in their 2020 paper 'Building Sustainable
Digital Communities: A Five-Pronged Social-Informatics Research Approach in
Bangladesh'. In a project with Oxfam, her team is working with women in this

region to design sustainable mobile apps based on their community's values. If
this isn't a virtuous circle, I don't know what is.
Artificial intelligence has the potential to change the lives of women in
agriculture. But there remains a digital literacy gap. This is the subject of a 2022
UNESCO (and partners) report entitled 'The Effects of AI on the Working
Lives of Women'.4 The gap is clearly evident among 'older, less educated and
poorer women, and those in rural areas'.
The report reveals women could benefit from agricultural AI but 'those in a
better financial position i.e. mainly men, are best placed to adopt the technology,
implying that AI adoption will worsen existing gender inequalities'.
How do we fix this? The UN is calling for equality to be built into both the
AI workforce and the design of the technology.
Positive moves are afoot. At the 2021 Generation Equality Forum, world
leaders, philanthropists and the private sector pledge US$40 billion towards
upending structural inequity. Dr Joan Palmiter Bajorek's global organisation
Women in Voice is growing exponentially. At the time of writing, there are 20
chapters in 14 countries with more than 100 ambassadors. 'I meet young
Latinas, who see Latinas on stage and they're like, "Oh, I could join this field. I
could belong here, this seems of interest",' she tells me.
Let's look at the multitude of ways we can work together to create lasting
change - before it's too late.

EMBRACING EQUITY
'If we don't get women and people of color at the table - real technologists doing
the real work - we will bias systems. Trying to reverse that a decade or two from
now will be so much more difficult, if not close to impossible.'
Fei-Fei Li, co-director, Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial
Intelligence; co-founder, AI4ALL
Born in China, Fei-Fei Li and her family move to the US when she's 16. While
studying physics at Princeton, Li works every weekend in her parents' dry
cleaning store. For a long time, she's the only woman in her faculty - a 'lonely
process' she tells the CNBC website in 2019, echoing Dr Bajorek's line about
Eleanor Rigby.
In 2015, Li launches a summer outreach program for Stanford's Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory. This evolves into AI4ALL, a free online program for
high school students. 'Women, underrepresented, racial minority, low income
family students and geographically diverse students. And we're seeing this
message spreading. We're seeing their leadership spreading. And I think they're
going to become a powerful force in AI's future,' she says.
Programs like this are popping up everywhere, from the global group Women
in AI to Australia's Young Women Leaders in AI, TechDiversity, Queensland's
Women in Technology (WiT) - which was established back in 1997 - and the
Yielding Accomplished African Women organisation. The latter is responsible
for the largest digital academy for African women in STEM.
Based in Sydney, Dr Nicky Ringland describes herself as a recovering
computer linguist. This Superstar of STEM is the brains behind the Girls'
Programming Network in Australia. Tens of thousands of students and teachers
benefit from her programs.

Activists, advocates and scientists are generating opportunities for greater
diversity and inclusion in the tech sector. By golly, we need it. A report by
Deloitte Access Economics in late 2022 reveals a retrograde nation: almost one
in three Australian men think gender inequality doesn't exist. This is second
only to Saudi Arabia.
Education and training, role modelling and mentoring, and leadership
programs are terrific, but they only go so far. They don't address historical data,
which is poisoning machine learning. When this happens, we 'breathe our own
exhaust', in the words of Loren Goodman, Chief Technology Officer at InRule
Technology.
Goodman suggests a human solution to this man-made problem: 'Put people
at the helm of deciding when to take or not take real-world actions based on a
machine learning prediction,' he writes on the website VentureBeat in 2022.
'Explainability and transparency are critical for allowing people to understand
AI and why technology makes certain decisions and predictions.'1
Oversight is crucial. But people are fallible. Also, on occasion, venal. So
should we also hold a big stick?
'Quality marks need to be introduced to showcase that an algorithm has
undergone due process,' Ivana Bartoletti, Global Chief Privacy Officer at Indian
technology company Wipro, tells me during our Zoom interview. 'Risky
algorithms need a licensing mechanism. In the case of breaches, stark fines
should be issued, as well as redress mechanisms.'
Antitrust reform in the US would go a long way towards fixing this, by
breaking up the cabal that is Big Tech. This is legislation that prevents or
controls trusts or other monopolies.
Other researchers are looking at the root of the problem. How can we create
more diverse datasets to erase the mistakes of the past? Artificial intelligence
services could be rated for 'most accurate' or 'freshest dataset'. This would
improve the transparency of the tech companies' processes. Of course, ratings
would have to be decided by unbiased experts, rather than crowdsourced.
In medtech, more diverse populations could be enrolled in clinical trials. This
has the benefit of opening up the trials to people from marginalised

communities. Their data is added to the body of research used by the machines.
Another virtuous loop!
However, these are long-term salves to festering wounds. Legal action seems
to be a faster pathway. Many companies and software sellers are worried about
being sued, because their automated systems discriminate against 'protected
classes of individuals' under employment law. This is fuelling an industry of
consultants who recommend tools to eliminate bias.
Organisations need to use more diverse datasets. And they need to test
rigorously to ensure historical bias isn't replicated by artificial intelligence. But
this isn't as easy as it seems.
Let's look at research into AI bias in a system classifying brain activity from
MRI scans. This is front of mind for me - literally and figuratively - after
undergoing several scans during long COVID. Incidentally, one uncovers an
aneurysm. The neurologist breaks the news by saying, 'Oh, you have an
incidental aneurysm', then starts talking about something else. Quite the
bedside manner!
My doctors are uncertain about whether the inflammation from COVID-19
contributed to the creation or growth of this aneurysm because the pandemic is
relatively new. And - you guessed it - aneurysms in this position are
predominantly 
experienced 
by 
women, 
particularly 
those 
who 
are
postmenopausal. Researchers haven't spent enough time studying why older
women are predisposed to this condition.
In a similar way, there isn't much historical data from Black populations, so
artificial intelligence performs poorly on this cohort. In 2022, researchers decide
to do an experiment, curating a dataset containing only images from Black
people and comparing the results with a dataset dominated by white people. The
results are astonishing: the AI system is still less accurate for Black patients than
it is when using a majority white dataset. The question is why. The answer is, we
don't know. But it could lie in the past. Our understanding of how blood flows
through the brain may be racially biased.
Jingwei Li, who co-authors the paper 'Cross-ethnicity/race generalization
failure of behavioral prediction from resting-state functional connectivity',
explains it like this: '... during preprocessing, a convention is to align individuals'

brains to a standard brain template so that individual brains can be comparable.
But these brain templates were usually created from the White population.'2 Li
stresses the research doesn't confirm there are neurobiological or psychometric
measures that differ in populations due to their ethnicities. The history of
eugenics casts a long shadow.
The question remains: do we need legislation, regulation or more
consternation? There's no one-size-fits-all solution. In 2022, New York City
Council passes a bill about artificial intelligence in employment. This requires
managers to engage an independent auditor to evaluate their algorithms. If in
breach, companies face fines of up to - wait for it - US$1500. Talk about being
slapped with a wet lettuce leaf.
Groups like the Centre for Democracy and Technology are further
concerned about the design of audits 'based solely on race and gender, and not
other variables like disability, age and other factors'. Deb Raji from the
Algorithmic Justice League reckons there should be an external audit oversight
board and a national reporting system to flag potential violations. Otherwise, in-
house audits would be prone to bias, with a low likelihood of anyone belling the
cat. We know how well self-regulation works - cue eye-rolling emoji. Quis
custodiet ipsos custodes, to quote the Roman poet, Juvenal. Who's watching the
watchers?
Perhaps answers exist within other industries. Writing for the website Swiss
Cognitive, ethics researcher Lorenzo Belenguer calls for 'a transnational
independent body with enough power to guarantee the implementation of [AI
bias] solutions'. In particular, Belenguer is looking to the pharmaceutical
industry.
Any new drug goes through four stages in order to be released onto the
market. Once it's on sale, regulators do follow-ups. Before being introduced into
another country, the drug is assessed by an independent body, such as the
Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia. If any harm is caused, there's a
scheme for compensation. Other academics argue artificial intelligence
companies should be regulated like architects, who learn to work with city
planners, certification schemes and licences to make buildings safe.

I love the idea of a 'dignity lens' being put on artificial intelligence. What does
this mean? Well, it comes from a collaboration between the Australian National
University and the Centre for Public Impact. In 2022, Lorenn Ruster, a PhD
candidate in the School of Cybernetics at ANU, examines the extent to which
dignity is a driving force behind AI ethics in the governments of Australia,
Canada and the UK. She discovers the ecosystem is 'off-balance' because
governments take action to protect citizens reactively rather than proactively. In
other words, the horse has bolted; the damage is already done. Governments
tend to act at a glacial pace: asbestos, anyone?
Manisha Amin, CEO at the Centre for Inclusive Design, points to a
fundamental misunderstanding in the way we think about artificial intelligence.
According to Amin, we tend to assume that rational decisions, like those made
by Spock on Star Trek, are the gold standard. '... as such,' she tells me by email,
'[we] will veer on the side of an AI decision rather than our own.' Amin cites
examples in the US in which judges with AI support are more likely to change
their verdicts if the technology's results differ from their own.
'It's true,' says Amin, 'we aren't like Spock but more rounded and emotional
- like Captain Kirk - and that's a good thing.' Humans often make decisions by
weighing up the social implications. AI simply doesn't have our 'evolutionary
advantage'. Australia is fortunate to have great thinkers like Manisha Amin, and
the scientists at CSIRO.
CSIRO's Data61 made an early attempt at grappling with this issue in its
2019 discussion paper 'Artificial Intelligence: Australia's Ethics Framework',
insisting that: 'AI systems must also be contestable, and the people and
organisations behind algorithms must be held accountable for their impacts.'
But by the time it gets to government, the paper is replete with weasel words.
Under the AI Action Plan developed by the Department of Industry, the ethics
framework is entirely voluntary. Someone should send the department a
dictionary so staffers can learn the definition of 'action'.
Anyone who understands human behaviour knows we're motivated by sticks
as well as carrots. Personally, I prefer dark chocolate. But seriously, intimidation
works every time. Regulators need to turn up the threat level to 11, to quote the
rockumentary This is Spinal Tap.

Unsurprisingly, some of the best solutions are contained in a 2021 report
written by my mate Ed Santow, the former Human Rights Commissioner.3 It's
an opus: a three-year report into the 'unprecedented opportunities and threats'
posed by artificial intelligence. This is the most extensive consultation on
artificial intelligence and human rights conducted anywhere in the world.
'We then need to make sure we put in place the protections that ensure we
don't have a dystopian reality that we wake up to,' Santow says. Damn right.
He's concerned the gains we've made around equality in recent decades will
go backwards. With ropey connectivity on Zoom due to his children schooling
from home, Santow traverses the international landscape.
While China is pursuing artificial intelligence untethered from liberal
democratic values and America is letting the market decide, Australia has the
opportunity to forge its own road.
'Responsible innovation is precisely what citizens of countries like Australia,
Canada, France and so on want,' Santow says. 'There's a competitive edge there.
And so I think that it's not just the right thing to do. It's a smart thing to do.'
There are parallels in renewable energy. Progressive solar, wind and hydro
companies are at the forefront of responsible innovation: good for the planet
and the bottom line.
Multinationals often use Australia as a testbed, particularly for new
technology. This represents another opportunity. The tech giants could pilot
innovations here, following a proper human rights assessment. Ed Santow refers
to the concept of a regulatory sandbox. This means companies creating devices
must reach a certain threshold of safety before they're tested in the real world.
Use of the devices would be monitored closely by authorities to ensure people
are protected. If not, the rules are tweaked. 'It provides a bridge from the lab to
the real world,' he says.
Santow's report calls for Australia to establish the world's first AI Safety
Commissioner. But the role wouldn't be that of a regulator. The commissioner
would lead an organisation providing advice to the government and the private
sector about inserting fairness and accountability into artificial intelligence.
Santow says he's 'optimistic' the federal government will take action on the
report but is urging haste.

'My hope is that it doesn't take the next kind of catastrophic failure in AI for
the government to really prioritise this,' Santow says. 'I hope, rather, that
Australians will be very clear with the government that this should be
prioritised.'
How many people will be wounded - or killed - before proper protections
are put in place?
What I'm learning is there are plenty of well-intentioned statements on this
topic, and very little real-world action. Australia is one of 42 countries
committed to developing standards for AI based on principles developed by the
OECD. For example, artificial intelligence should benefit 'people and the planet
by driving inclusive growth, sustainable development, and wellbeing'; and
'respect the rule of law, human rights, democratic values and diversity'.
There should be transparency and responsible disclosure around AI systems,
which must function in a 'robust, secure and safe way', and 'organisations and
individuals developing, deploying or operating AI systems should be held
accountable for their proper functioning in line with the above principles'. Well,
who wouldn't want that?
The World Economic Forum is strengthening the governance of artificial
intelligence through its aptly named Centre for the Fourth Industrial
Revolution. This includes high-level guidance, workbooks and frameworks to
assist in decision-making, in collaboration with national governments.
Meanwhile, the European Union is explicitly highlighting the ethical
development of artificial intelligence as a source of competitive advantage.
Maybe waving cash at parliamentarians and business leaders will work after all?
If appealing to our leaders' basic humanity fails, we can always rely upon bribery.
Gotta have carrots as well as sticks, remember.
The EU Parliament is currently debating a wide-ranging AI Act that would
categorise technologies depending on the risks they pose to social wellbeing,
with stringent obligations on those that could substantially disrupt society.
About time! Germany is tapping the brakes on automated vehicles, rolling out
ethical guidance on their development. And back home, the Office of the
Australian Information Commissioner is investigating Kmart and Bunnings
over the use of facial recognition technology in their stores.

Frankly, the stakes couldn't be higher. Our lives hang in the balance.

THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT
'If AI has a goal and humanity just happens to be in the way, it will destroy humanity
as a matter of course without even thinking about it... It's just like, if we're building
a road and an anthill just happens to be in the way, we don't hate ants, we're just
building a road.'
Elon Musk
Terrorism, pandemics, seatbelts, cigarettes and mesothelioma have one thing in
common. And it's not the letter 'e'. Nor 's'. But thanks for playing, fellow
Scrabble nerds. We don't think too deeply about these subjects until calamities
occur on a global scale, like September 11 or COVID-19. Or until we lose a
loved one to a car accident or cancer.
Humans are reluctant to act with haste, even when presented with
compelling evidence. Research warning of the dangers of driving, smoking and
asbestos was published many decades before it was taken seriously. The question
now is: will we act to restrict rampant artificial intelligence before it imperils us
all?
In mid-2022, US Republican senator Rob Portman and Democrat Gary
Peters introduce the Global Catastrophic Risk Management Act. A bipartisan
bill is quite a feat in these polarised times. The name says it all: the risk of
malfunctioning AI is on par with novel diseases, biotechnology accidents, super
volcanoes and solar flares. There's a far higher risk of artificial intelligence
destroying humanity by the end of the century than climate change or nuclear
war.
Elon Musk has claimed that artificial intelligence is our 'biggest existential
threat': 'Mark my words, AI is far more dangerous than nukes... why do we have
no regulatory oversight?'

These are strong words for someone who expresses a libertarian philosophy.
But no-one is ready for this technology to go rogue.
The usual 'risk versus reward' levers aren't working. We're viewing this issue
through a microscope instead of a fisheye lens. Perhaps it's time to rethink how
entire organisations are structured. During one of the COVID-19 lockdowns, I
do a company director's course. I'm a devotee of lifelong learning. And I've run
out of Nordic Noir to watch on Netflix.
Fun fact: a company is its own entity with rights - just like a person. As a
director, your foremost obligation is to the survival of this entity. Therefore, the
profit motive is enshrined in legislation above all else: ethics, morals or
humanity. If you ignore this, it's a breach of the law. By definition, this system
values the almighty dollar above human life.
At an individual company level, there should be shorter terms for directors
and increased diversity on boards to eliminate dangerous 'group think'. Back in
2013, all seven Twitter board members were male. This partly explains the
culture of toxic masculinity on the platform. At the time of writing, three of the
nine directors are female. In 2022, Meta's board is 40 per cent female.
Google has an external advisory council on artificial intelligence while Meta
has co-founded an AI ethics research centre. Does this mean they're finally
taking ethics seriously? Probably not. Experts say these bodies have little or no
impact.
Could our great thinkers get us out of this mess? Universities are bastions of
progressive thought. Stanford University has an Institute for Human-Centered
Artificial Intelligence with this mission: 'The creators and designers of AI must
be broadly representative of humanity.' However, the majority of the 121 faculty
members are white and male. The AI Now Institute, based at New York
University, does a better job. Co-founded by Meredith Whittaker from Google
and Kate Crawford at Microsoft, the organisation is fiercely independent,
refusing to accept corporate donations.
One of its funders, the not-for-profit Luminate, is spending US$27 million
to create the Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative. Indian billionaire Romesh
Wadhwani, with his brother Sunil, is putting a similar amount towards the
Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence. They're among a handful of tech

giants forging a new frontier in philanthropy because they're so perturbed by
artificial intelligence. But when you compare it with the net worth of tech
billionaires, you realise these numbers are small change.
A lateral approach comes in the form of copyright law. Data used to build
artificial intelligence systems might violate copyright. But a case hasn't yet been
contested at law. Until this happens, tech companies will continue to use easily
accessible and biased datasets, while their inner processes remain opaque. In the
battle between ethics and economics, the latter always comes out on top.
AI expert Dr Catriona Wallace says nothing will change while the tech gurus
are raking in the big bucks. 'Having strong ethics and responsible AI
frameworks, and a diverse team, etc, makes that process much slower, much
more expensive, and much more difficult to do,' she says. 'And so the model of
profit trumps anything ethical or any real investment in diversity at this point in
time.' Only eight per cent of Australian-based organisations are 'regarded as
mature in their use of the responsible AI principles and have acted on them'. She
cites Telstra as one company building decent ethical frameworks.
This is no surprise. Former CEO of Telstra David Thodey is an early adopter
of 'all roles flex', with the policy of employees choosing how, when and where
they work implemented across every business unit during 2013-14. Yes, telcos
piss us off from time to time. I'm a frequent visitor to the complaints line. But
large organisations need to lead the way in transforming culture.
Known as Australia's Godfather of Innovation, Thodey is a tech leader who
studied Anthropology and English at university. He's a big picture thinker
who's still walking the walk as a Champion of Change (a member of the
coalition striving for gender equality). 'We have so many wonderful people, we
just need to give them opportunities, and capability is not defined by gender,' he
tells the EY Change Happens podcast in 2022.
Thodey and Genevieve Bell of ANU's School of Cybernetics have been
pushing for an AI ethics body for years.
Of course, the problem is broader than gender. Fortunately, there are more
opportunities for people from marginalised communities during this time in
history. Dr Wallace issues a strong call to action in her speeches: 'Those of you
who are sitting there and you might be female, or you might be from a minority

group, or you might be transgender, or you may come from the disability sector.
You might think this is a challenge to your career. But it will be your asset,
because what we know going forward is the big tech companies, and all of us
investing in AI, are desperately after diversity. So I would say particularly women
of colour, you've got it made. Just know it, own it, be confident, and use it.'
'The Frontiers of AI', a panel discussion hosted by the Australian National
University in 2022, features the founder of the country's first Indigenous edu-
tech company. 'So bringing our people along on the journey, allowing us space
to dream and think and do in AI, is going to be really important,' Indigital's
Mikaela Jade says. The way for artificial intelligence to benefit all of humanity is
to 'bring it back to country and bring it back to my people who have 80,000
years of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in our DNA'. What
an eloquent point. Journalists, take note.
Still, Associate Professor Yolande Strengers of Monash University isn't
confident things will shift 'within the institutional supertankers of the "big five"
in terms of their dominant trajectories'.
She's only optimistic about progress on the margins: 'It's in the startups. It's
in the novelty kind of voices and personalities. So it's on the fringes.' The
regulatory environment around technology is incredibly far behind. 'It's going
to be extremely difficult to retrospectively impose any kind of regulatory, ethical,
or environmental or other kinds of codes and practices onto this industry,
particularly given how powerful it now is,' she says. That horse is out of the
paddock and galloping towards the horizon.
Perhaps a grassroots approach is required - led by all of us. We need to value
the kind of things we want embedded in these devices. 'Now, it's a bit of a
chicken and egg scenario, which comes first,' Strengers says. 'I think the
technology industry can bring society along that path, if it wants to, and if that's
part of its goals and missions, and hopefully, ideally, it would be. But it can also
work the other way. Society can put pressure on those companies, and we can
help them see that we value that diversity.' (You can find some suggestions about
how to apply this pressure in the Epilogue.)
Part of the answer lies in the history of artificial intelligence, and the failure of
the Dartmouth Conference: a multidisciplinary approach. A unique Australian

organisation is working on this now. The ARC Centre of Excellence for
Automated Decision-Making and Society brings together researchers in the
humanities, social and technological sciences. Director Julian Thomas says his
'central gravity' is the humanities.
'When we're dealing with something like Robodebt, for instance, we're not
just dealing with a little bit of code,' he tells me. 'That kind of system is the
result of not just the code, but the kind of data that people have fed into that
system. It's a product of the political and economic context in which it's been
generated. And of course, we'd say it's also a creature of the sort of institutions
that have produced it.' Unfortunately, most universities don't teach artificial
intelligence beyond the Computing and Engineering schools.
Thomas cites blockchain and smart contracts as two areas of rapidly
emerging technology to be watched closely. Blockchain is a system in which
transactions are recorded across computers linked in a peer-to-peer network. It's
used a lot for cryptocurrency. Smart contracts are scripts on a blockchain that
execute an agreement between a seller and a buyer. 'You see some amazing
successes, but you also see great failures,' he explains. 'There's also that risk of
significant failure, which can have very damaging consequences for people.'
It seems the entire institutional system in government, the legal and business
sector, and the media is being replaced by machines. Humans are
overwhelmingly being sidelined from making important decisions.
Robodebt is a classic case, involving recovery notices creating debts based on
a mismatch between two pieces of data. In the past, people would oversee such
processes. Not anymore. The ARC wants citizens and consumers to play bigger
roles. In Australia, organisations like CHOICE could educate the users of these
services to avoid the pitfalls while concurrently influencing change in
government and business.
In the future, artificial intelligence will be the lynchpin in how we
communicate and interact with others in the world. It's incumbent upon us to
understand the basic building blocks; to make informed choices. Yes, it's hard to
understand, but this is short-term pain for long-term gain.
To automate equality instead of inequality, Associate Professor Virginia
Eubanks says we should interrogate the past. 'I think we can make much better

decisions about the ways these technologies will impact our communities if we
look to our history,' she says. 'We can also see how struggle has succeeded in the
past, and how we can make it succeed again in the future.' Eubanks, from the
University at Albany, cites the civil rights movement as a template. The ability to
transform society is within our hands. We should view this as a once-in-a-
lifetime opportunity.
The tech companies care about cash, so hit them where it hurts: in the hip
pocket. Boycott brands selling biased devices. Lobby powerbrokers to regulate
and legislate, and support innovative organisations led by women and people of
colour.
Dr Joan Palmiter Bajorek, of the advocacy group Women in Voice, gives a
terrific example in the area of speech recognition. 'Remember that women and
minorities have huge purchasing power,' she says. 'This is absolutely a matter of
social injustice. But if that alone doesn't convince companies to fix the problem,
they should consider that the accuracy of speech recognition also affects
customer purchasing decisions. I have affluent English-Spanish bilingual friends
who have chosen not to buy smart fridges because they know that the fridges
will not understand them.'
Philanthropist Melinda Gates frequently discusses financial 'blind spots'.
'Women are [responsible for] 85 per cent of consumer dollars spent. Women
control 70 per cent of financial decisions in the house. So, you're missing an
opportunity... you're leaving money on the table,' she tells Bloomberg.
While applying financial pressure, we can also change the narrative.
Storytelling moves hearts and minds. There's a lovely article on the website of
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development penned by Director
Shamika N. Sirimanne. She's determined to use global storytelling to reposition
women in STEM. Like the story of Anna Ekeledo, executive director of
AfriLabs Foundation, who by early 2023 runs a network of 400 technology and
innovation hubs across 52 African countries assisting entrepreneurs to create
jobs.
'Unless we get more women working on technology and innovation and have
more stories to tell, women will not have a say in how we communicate, work,

produce food, provide health care and educate the world for future generations,'
Sirimanne writes. 'That's not the future we need.'
Indeed.
Machines representing all races and genders should serve us equally, as we
face an uncertain future. In 1972 political philosopher John Rawls speaks of
lifting the 'veil of ignorance'. He suggests the best way for leaders to make
decisions with far-reaching impact is to put themselves in the shoes of the people
directly affected. Yes, it's the 'golden rule' again. A little bit of empathy goes a
long way. The behemoths of tech should take a leaf out of Rawls's book: the
future of humanity is in their hands.

DYSTOPIA?
'Seek success but prepare for vegetables.'
Inspirobot
Sentient machines could be running the world within our lifetimes. This is why
we secretly like it when they stuff up. Inspirobot is an artificial intelligence
designed to create inspirational quotes. This should be quite easy: take some
positive mantras and pop them over a pretty backdrop. The results? Well, see for
yourself. 'Before inspiration comes the slaughter'; 'Keep panicking'; 'If you want
to get somewhere in life you have to try to be dead'. Yep. Another epic fail.
What's not so funny is the result when the stakes are somewhat higher.
'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the
human race,' Stephen Hawking tells the BBC in 2014.1 'It would take off on its
own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by
slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.' Gee,
that's cheery. Thanks, Steve. The fourth Industrial Revolution will alter
everything. But the question is, will it be for better or worse? For richer or
poorer? In sickness and in health? After all, we'll become wedded to this
technology.
Transhumanism is no longer a scene from a B-grade science fiction movie.
The World Economic Forum (WEF) predicts the first implantable mobile phone
will be commercially available soon. If you're recoiling and thinking, 'Not this
little black duck!', remember this: our smartphones are already attached to our
hands. We're wearing mini-computers on our wrists. And many of us have
medtech devices implanted in our bodies. Frankly, we're becoming the monsters
we're fighting.

Taking an optimistic view, artificial intelligence and machine learning could
contribute to a healthier, more equitable and less environmentally destructive
society. Woo hoo! I'm sure we'd pick this option, given the choice. But make no
mistake: there's a clear and present danger that we're heading towards a
dystopian future marked by authoritarian governments, mass unemployment
and poverty, and digitally-entrenched injustice. That spot you're standing on,
right now, is at the crossroads to one of these futures. If we don't act quickly,
we'll be so far down the track there may be no way back. And I'm not the only
Chicken Little.
Klaus Schwab, German engineer, economist and founder of the World
Economic Forum, sounds a warning bell back in 2016: 'The speed of current
breakthroughs has no historical precedent.'2 This global revolution is evolving
exponentially and disrupting every industry: 'The breadth and depth of these
changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production,
management, and governance.' Schwab is convinced the pay gap between high-
and low-skilled workers will widen, intensifying the racial and gender tensions
causing fault lines across the globe. Social, economic and political instability will
likely lead to war.
So what do the futurists see? In the same year as the comments from Klaus
Schwab, a chap by the name of Robin Hanson releases his book The Age of Em.
Hanson envisages human work becoming obsolete and an elite class of
humanoid robots ruling the world. They have a choice to put people out to
pasture or exterminate us. Like the Daleks from Doctor Who: 'Exterminate!
Exterminate!' I beseech you to be nice to the robots; you may be spared by our
overlords.
If you consider this far-fetched, think again. Robin Hanson isn't a fantasist.
He's a graduate of one of the world's top research universities, Caltech. You
might know of this institution as the alma mater of the characters in The Big
Bang Theory. Hanson now works as an economist at George Mason University.
'You should expect whatever change is going to happen, it's going to happen
pretty fast,' he says in a 2017 TED Talk. 'Like, five years from nothing different
that you'd notice to a completely different world. What I want is to have people
understand how urgent it is, when this thing shows up, to have made a plan.'

This monster is already wreaking havoc in the workplace and taking unsteady
steps into our households. A single Twitter exchange exemplifies the relentless
march of technology: 'Wait. I've just seen a touchscreen toaster,' to which
someone responds, 'A friend told me recently he had to upgrade the firmware in
his kettle.' Firmware. In a kettle. I need another cup of tea and a good lie-down.
The speed at which artificial intelligence is developing is alarming. Today,
scientists are less worried about smart robots than the errors we're coding into
the not-so-smart machines proliferating around the globe. Like Google Nest,
which left people freezing in their homes due to an unfixable error.
Perhaps we're looking at this upside-down. Australia's Gradient Institute is
dedicated to building ethics, accountability and transparency into artificial
intelligence systems. In 2022, the institute makes a submission to a government
task force about the role of regulation in allowing automated decision-making to
reach its full potential. But the scientists warn the government it's asking the
wrong question: the danger is not that regulation will prevent AI from reaching
its full potential, but that lack of regulation won't prevent AI from reaching its
'great potential for harm'.
The institute warns about so-called 'tail risks'. These occur in complex
networked systems because mistakes multiply exponentially; so fast they can
reach crisis point before there's time to avert a disaster. What we know is this:
inequitable, flawed and potentially lethal technology is coming at us like an out-
of-control freight train. Soon, it'll be unstoppable. It's almost impossible to
retrofit solutions.
At the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, the 'Founding Fathers' have no idea
this technology could revolutionise the world. In that heady North American
summer, as Senje the dog plays about their feet and Mrs Minsky makes coffee,
the fellas contemplate artificial intelligence solely in terms of cost savings for
business. They give no thought to the possibilities for social improvement or any
negative consequences.
Narrowly focused, this hodgepodge group has no consideration for the
capacity for harm, should their vision be realised.
Before and after Dartmouth, the members of AI's famed patriarchy build
their fortunes on the backs of others, including many women. This gender

imbalance is endemic within the field of artificial intelligence research and
development. They're not only responsible for a man-made future; it's a future
made for men.
Let me be clear: The men of Dartmouth are not the owners of this
intellectual property. It's Ada Lovelace who takes a broader view of computing;
Hedy Lamarr who pioneers technology leading to wi-fi, GPS, and Bluetooth;
and Grace Hopper who discovers a way for us to 'talk' to machines. Almost
entirely unrecognised, the kilo-girls and ENIAC girls of the 1940s - and the
'stable of secretaries' in the 1980s - do thousands of hours of tedious, repetitive
and underpaid work to create the 'computer age'. In the 1950s and 60s, as 'man'
begins to look to the stars, women like Hilda Carpenter and the 'Little Old
Ladies' at NASA hand-weave memory into the computers that take Apollo 11 to
the moon.
Without Digital Equipment Corporation's commitment to affirmative
action, we might not have STP or TRILL, brought to us by the 'mother of the
internet', Radia Perlman. Tim Berners-Lee is credited with 'inventing' the
internet, 20 years after Pam Hardt-English developed a computerised bulletin
board linking libraries and bookstores in the San Francisco Bay area. This history
proves women do much of the physical, creative and intellectual work in the
technology sector, but men set the parameters and maintain control, taking the
credit and the profits. It remains the same to this very day.
Where do women and people in marginalised groups fit into this man-made
utopia? Who will access the new technology? Whose interests will it serve?
Whose pockets will it line? Who will it empower? Who will it disempower?
Who will decide what innovations are helpful and which are harmful - and will
they actually care?
There's an existing 'digital divide' with women, older folk, those from low
socio-economic backgrounds, people with disabilities, and anyone living in
developing nations being less likely to have smartphones or the internet. If
artificial intelligence is to become the new global 'means of production', are we
content for it to be principally owned and operated by wealthy white men?
A 2019 report by consultants, McKinsey & Company, details how quickly
workers will have to adapt. The authors say by 2030, as many as five million

Australians may be forced to change their occupations because of automation.3
Jobs once thought of as immune to displacement, in the creative industries
and visual arts scene, are being shaken to their foundations. Copyright law is
insufficient to protect artists and designers. Machine learning systems DALL·E
and Midjourney use massive data banks to generate images within seconds. The
name of the former is a clever combination of the Pixar character WALL-E and
artist Salvador Dalí.
A case in point: the publishers of this book use Midjourney to create the
cover. The idea has been suggested by designer Meng Koach to show the impact
of AI on his profession. To construct this image, we feed phrases into the
machine. This is not a fringe practice: esteemed magazines like The Economist
and The Atlantic are doing it, too.
In fact, Midjourney is winning art prizes, to the consternation of actual
artists. There are accusations of cheating, plagiarism and the death of artistry.
Certainly, there are worrying copyright issues. But I tend to agree with the head
of CSIRO's Data61 Institute, Professor Jon Whittle. 'Even things like DALL·E I
don't necessarily see as replacing human creativity but rather augmenting
human creativity,' he tells the ABC.
Image generators remain controversial, epitomised by an experiment unveiled
in August 2022 involving Stable Diffusion, a deep-learning text-to-image model.
AI researcher Sasha Luccioni decides to build a tool to expose the biases behind
the model. Using the Stable Diffusion Explorer, if you type 'ambitious CEO' the
machine will generate pictures of men in black or blue suits. At least there's
diversity in their attire. 'Supportive CEO' displays an equal number of women
and men. Try asking Stable Diffusion to show pictures of an engineer: all of
them are men. It seems no women work in engineering in the robot world. And
if you want an image of a male nurse? Forget about it. They don't exist, either.
Models like Stable Diffusion consume an enormous amount of energy. As
these companies use larger and larger datasets, their requirements go through the
roof. What are the implications for our climate?
First, the good news: artificial intelligence can be utilised to design more
energy-efficient buildings, optimise recycling systems and monitor emissions.

For example, AI could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5-10 per cent,
according to Boston Consulting Group.
But US computer scientist Kate Saenko brings us back to earth: artificial
intelligence has a skyrocketing carbon footprint. Training a single AI model
generates as many carbon emissions as building and driving five cars over their
lifetimes. One. Single. Model. What will happen when the world is powered by
artificial intelligence? 'Unless we switch to 100 per cent renewable energy
sources, AI progress may stand at odds with the goals of cutting greenhouse
emissions and slowing down climate change,' Saenko writes in The Conversation
in 2020.
I decide to email one of my clients about this thorny topic. Natalie Kyriacou
is an environmentalist, board advisor and CEO of My Green World. Kyriacou is
concerned about AI's ability to accelerate fossil fuel exploration. Imagine a
planet where coal and oil barons can extract outdated power sources more easily,
using modern technologies. It's frightening. She also points to 'more systemic
consequences in which AI applications - particularly through advertising - may
affect society more broadly by encouraging unsustainable consumer behaviours'.
This is happening in a host of ways. Businesses use big data to microtarget
people in particular demographics in order to sell them stuff. Generally, it's stuff
we don't need.
Like me, Kyriacou is a glass half-full kinda gal. I ask whether she predicts a
future utopia or dystopia: 'I imagine a utopian future where AI augments our
human ingenuity, creativity and empathy to assist us in protecting and restoring
natural resources; a future where the people and communities impacted by
technology transition play a critical role in reasserting their culture, their voice
and their right to determine their own future through AI.' But there's a caveat.
'Whether or not we choose to harness this technology for the betterment of the
planet, however, is up to us,' Kyriacou says.
We must act quickly. Climate change is escalating the incidence and intensity
of natural disasters. Women and girls - particularly in developing nations - are
disproportionately affected. If artificial intelligence worsens this crisis, guess
who'll pay the price? Women, too, are affected in the aftermath of war, while
men make up most of the casualties in the heat of battle.

But modern warfare is evolving. Scientists, academics, geopolitical analysts,
the United Nations and even China are alarmed at the implications of killing
machines driven by artificial intelligence. Our inability to regulate AI could
cause World War III. It'd be over within minutes. Staying silent could mean the
end of humanity. The time to raise our voices is now.

UTOPIA?
'The future is a choice between Utopia and oblivion.'
R. Buckminster Fuller, inventor and visionary
We don't need a crystal ball. To predict the future, we must look to the past. The
rise of new, urban manufacturing industries in the late nineteenth century
fundamentally altered the nature of work. During the second Industrial
Revolution, concerns were raised about child labour, working hours, pay and
conditions. Most workers repetitively constructed components, deriving none of
the creative pleasure that comes with producing a complete object.
As artificial intelligence becomes ubiquitous, alarm bells are ringing about
the rise of the gig economy fuelled by underpaid, overworked and invisible
'ghost workers'. A twin threat is the huge potential for job losses in both blue
and white collar work. Stanford University researcher, Andrew Ng, reckons the
fear-mongering about a dystopia caused by 'Evil AI' - sentient robots intent on
world domination - is diverting us from a much more likely outcome of this
fourth Industrial Revolution: mass unemployment and its inevitable social and
political impacts.
'AI is expected to be better equipped than humans to write a high school
essay by 2026, drive a truck by 2027, work in retail by 2031, write a bestselling
book by 2049, and perform surgery by 2053,' Darrell West, vice-president of the
Brookings Institute, explains in his 2019 book, The Future of Work: Robotics, AI,
and Automation. 'There is a 50 per cent chance AI will outperform all human
tasks in 45 years and automate all human jobs in 120 years.'
If you want to write a book, you'd better get cracking! Before ChatGPT takes
all of our jobs.

Once again, people in low-status jobs - mainly young folks, people of colour
and women - will be the most vulnerable. Governments will have to reskill
workers and pay the unemployed to study. Education, the economy and welfare
systems will have to be restructured. A Universal Basic Income would be a
robust solution: a government program providing every adult with an income to
meet their basic needs. Historically, governments move too slowly to adjust to
tectonic societal shifts.
The first Industrial Revolution gave rise to capitalism. The second deepened
the gap between rich and poor. The third enabled the transition to an inter-
connected economy. This works well when everyone's playing together nicely. It
falls apart when the US housing market sneezes and we all get colds during a
Global Financial Crisis, or Russia invades Ukraine and Europe suddenly runs
out of gas.
Mass unemployment would create a larger underclass. This is always a
catalyst for social unrest, creating an environment in which extreme forms of
populism flourish. Imagine a future full of Donald Trumps. Brrrrrrrrrr! I don't
know about you, but this is making my blood run cold.
On 6 January 2021, the world watches aghast as a mob fired up by Trumpian
rhetoric storms the Capitol Building, intent on overturning the result of the
election. It's an assault on democracy itself. In a global economy, the rise of more
populist leaders could have dire ramifications. Darrell West warns we could end
up with 'Trumpism on steroids'.
Proto-fascism is creeping into politics, emboldened by white, middle-class
people complaining they're getting a raw deal. As we see in the US - and, at the
risk of invoking Godwin's Law, in Germany under Hitler - certain groups do
not fare well in these circumstances. If artificial intelligence turbocharges
populism in politics, we face an apocalyptic future.
People living in the global south will suffer the most. Simon Greenman,
who's a member of the Global AI Council at the World Economic Forum,
predicts artificial intelligence is only going to profit the big corporations and
countries where research and development is centred: specifically China, the US,
Japan, Germany, the UK and France.

The AI economy is looking a lot like a colonial economy, in which people in
poorer nations work long hours in low-paid menial jobs to provide profits for
their Western masters. Women and children are already working in sweatshops
to keep the West supplied with fast fashion. Will artificial intelligence entrench
this kind of economic colonialism?
The tech industry is not known for its equitable distribution of wealth. The
bulk of the benefits flow to tech billionaires - almost all of them male, mostly in
the US. When wealth is distributed inequitably, it destabilises geopolitics.
Of course, artificial intelligence is not, of itself, evil; nor are the men who
dominate the industry. This isn't about individuals.
At issue is the lack of diversity, the disparity in power and profits, and the
structures continuing to exclude women and people in marginalised
communities. An industry that loves to see itself as 'disruptive' is reluctant to
disrupt the male-centric, capitalist and colonialist structures that threaten
technology's potential to create a kinder, smarter and healthier world. Ironic
much?
When I speak to Dr Calvin Lai, Assistant Professor of Psychological and
Brain Sciences at Washington University in St Louis, he expresses some
optimism about the future, but concedes dystopian outcomes are likely if we
continue on this trajectory. Dr Lai's silver lining lies in the actual coding of bias
into artificial intelligence. He describes it as 'a kind of paper trail that makes it
visible and fixable in a way it wasn't before'. Essentially, Lai says bias may be
easier to control in algorithms than in human interactions.
The question is, will artificial intelligence programs be sufficiently
transparent for us to identify these biases? Will companies and governments take
on the cost and responsibility of fixing the problem? And will they do it as a
priority before the systems become unfixable?
In his 2019 article 'The Good Life After Work', economic historian Robert
Skidelsky suggests if AI is built with human wellbeing rather than profit in
mind, this might 'offer an emancipation from work, opening up a vista of active
leisure - a theme going back to the ancient Greeks'.
Skidelsky's views echo those of Oscar Wilde writing in response to the
massive changes occurring in the nineteenth century. Most utopian thought at

that time saw socialism as the dominant form of government. Wilde's essay 'The
Soul of Man Under Socialism' predicts a world where machinery does all the
'ugly, horrible, uninteresting work'. Humans have 'delightful leisure in which to
devise wonderful and marvellous things for their own joy and the joy of everyone
else'. That sounds wonderful!
Amid the upheaval of the second Industrial Revolution, British textile
designer and social activist William Morris and American author and journalist
William Bellamy have vastly different concepts of how the future might unfold.
In his utopian novel Looking Backward, Bellamy envisions a world embracing
technology, with a universal basic income, shorter working hours and early
retirement.
Responding to Bellamy's work, Morris writes News from Nowhere. In
Morris's utopia, the people revolt against the dystopia of industrialised society
and return to a rural way of life. According to Morris, the simplicity of their
lifestyle requires only voluntary labour, most of it pleasurable and rewarding.
Money effectively becomes redundant.
Mass unemployment doesn't have to be a disaster, Sami Mahroum from the
not-for-profit business school INSEAD writes in The Jordan Times in 2019.
According to Mahroum, some unemployed people don't necessarily want work:
they seek financial security, a comfortable lifestyle and the opportunity to pursue
fulfilling interests.1
The belief that the only way to achieve this is by working 9 to 5 isn't shared
by every culture. Mahroum notes that Arab societies, which generally 'work to
live' rather than 'live to work', may provide a template. But how does this sit
within an economy obsessed with productivity?
These attitudes are 'not particularly compatible with economic systems that
require squeezing ever more productivity out of labor, but they are well suited
for an age of AI and automation', Mahroum writes. 'With the right mindset, all
societies could start to forge a new AI-driven social contract, wherein the state
would capture a larger share of the return on assets, and distribute the surplus
generated by AI and automation to residents. Publicly-owned machines would
produce a wide range of goods and services, from generic drugs, food, clothes,
and housing, to basic research, security, and transportation.'

Governments around the world have the capacity to make such structural
changes. It's their role, after all. But this would mean a major redistribution of
wealth. Vested interests would fight tooth and nail to maintain the status quo.
Mega-companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google - which are involved in a
digital arms race - would have to be broken up. Tech billionaires would have to
decentralise systems which currently funnel AI profits to individuals.
This isn't some lefty, commie utopia: in 2017, Bill Gates tells Quartz News
that governments should tax companies' use of artificial intelligence robots to
temporarily slow the speed of automation. Gates rejects self-regulation, insisting
governments must oversee programs of wealth redistribution. We all know the
dark side to the 'boy genius', but this idea is brilliant. Believe it or not, it's even
considered by the European Union. Sadly, European legislators ultimately reject
the proposition.
Let's take a deep breath: dystopia is far from inevitable. But almost without
exception, the experts I consult are very worried about the road we're travelling.
So how can we move towards a more utopian vision? First, we must ensure our
AI future is humanistic, collaborative and intersectional. Women, people of
colour, the LGBTQI+ community, those with disabilities and older folk need
quite a few seats at an awful lot of tables. Seismic changes are required at schools,
within industries and at the local community level to support more inclusion in
STEMM and STEAM.
People from disciplines beyond STEM will have to be involved in planning
and developing artificial intelligence systems, especially in terms of identifying
and managing risks. 'AI is a bit like maths in a way, it's going to be required in
every discipline, and so we need to be training up future workers not just to be
experts in health or law or manufacturing, or whatever it is, but to have those
underlying digital AI skills as well,' Data61's Professor Whittle tells the ABC in
2022. 'There's a wonderful quote... in the past jobs were about muscles,
currently they're about brains and in the future about the heart.'
But what does this mean for specific sectors?
The ability of artificial intelligence to mitigate climate change should be
explored, but the industry must take steps to reduce its own footprint. This
technology can be a boon for women's health and safety, but devices need to be

designed in consultation with diverse groups. Health care of the future will be
predictive and preventative, rather than reactive. But it has to be accessible to
everyone - not just white people in wealthy countries. AI could change the lives
of people who use social services. But the users must be included from the
outset.
Innovation has the potential to smooth every aspect of our lives, from
shopping to transport, employment and household duties. Machines that
gestate human life could free women from reproductive obligations and
biological restraints. A step too far for many, but something to think about,
nevertheless. If developed sensibly, artificial intelligence could take part of the
burden of caring for children, people with disabilities, and elderly relatives away
from women.
Currently, Indigenous people are looking into how artificial intelligence can
help conserve traditional lands, revitalise lost languages and preserve ancient
knowledge. This is through something called artificial-intelligence-enabled
cyber-physical systems (AI-CPS). Jeez. What on earth is that? Communications
professionals really need to simplify the tech-talk. Put simply, these systems
could monitor wildlife, reduce poaching and simulate ecological interventions.
Nowadays, Indigenous peoples manage around a quarter of the world's land
surface. Imagine the impact of combining old and new knowledge. It could
sustain the land and its inhabitants for future generations. In Australia, artificial
intelligence is already being used to care for Country.
During his Master of Applied Cybernetics at the Australian National
University, Rodolfo Ocampo works on the CSIRO Healthy Country AI
project. Developed in collaboration with Bininj Traditional Owners and
Indigenous rangers, the project manages invasive weeds, which are decimating
biodiversity in Kakadu.
'The Healthy Country AI-CPS uses drones to survey the land, machine
learning algorithms to classify aerial images and cloud technology to visualise
infestation maps,' Ocampo writes on the Australian National University website
in 2021. 'Algorithms and data management were trained integrating traditional
knowledge. For example, the Bininj six-season calendar is used to classify drone
footage.'

I've said it before. I'll say it again. We have so much to learn from Indigenous
culture, including in the area of artificial intelligence.
Distinguished Professor Genevieve Bell from the ANU echoes this thought.
She recommends taking inspiration from First Nations peoples when designing
the future. 'The concept of "always was, always will be" offers a through line
from past to present to future and makes clear both persistence and
responsibility,' she says in the 2021 Garran Oration. She calls it 'a meditation on
the shape of the future, and the tools and approaches we might need to cultivate
in order to succeed in it'.2
We need to work together to create a utopia. This begins with words and
ends with actions.
'I tend to think we have an obligation to tell stories about a future that is
more just and fair and equitable and sustainable, and thus also more optimistic,'
Bell tells me. 'And I think we also have an obligation to actively disrupt the
present to make those stories possible.'
This time in history is nothing short of transformative. However, it's painful
and exhausting because we're evolving from one stage to the next. 'Are we in the
process of giving birth to a whole new world?' social commentator Jane Caro
writes in the Sydney Morning Herald. 'Hopefully a fairer, less hierarchical
world, where we will live in greater harmony with one another and with the
natural environment? Is that why we are in such an uncomfortable and panicky
place right now? Just like mother and child, we know the world we are leaving
but we do not know the one we are going to.'
Maybe we should all go with the flow, confident of soon holding new life in
our hands. But it takes more than one party to create life. That's why the future
must be made by all of us, for all of us: human-made, not man-made.

EPILOGUE:
RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE
'Next time, ask: What's the worst that will happen? Then push yourself a little
further than you dare. Once you start to speak, people will yell at you. They will
interrupt you, put you down and suggest it's personal. And the world won't end.'
Audre Lorde, poet, activist, and radical feminist
It's 7.47 pm on a Monday in late 2022 and I'm lying in bed, reflecting upon my
hypocrisy. Two torn paper bags decorate the sheets: Uber Eats and
CHEMIST2U. After almost a year of chronic illness, I'm accustomed to
needing help for day-to-day activities like cooking, shopping and personal care.
But I still struggle with relying on Big Tech to deliver food and medicine.
Yes, I want you to rage against the machine. However, I understand -
viscerally - it's not possible to banish technology from our lives entirely. Herein
lies the conundrum: how can we change the machines when they're becoming
our carers, feeders and shoppers? Our substitute family? And our masters?
My latest mission is to switch from Uber to female-run transport in the form
of Shebah. The drivers are women, many of whom pick up a few extra dollars
during school hours. On paper, this business ticks all the boxes. But there are
simply not enough people using the service. It's tough to get a car when you
need it, especially at the last minute. Still, it's incumbent upon us to support
these efforts, to break the stranglehold of the homogenised tech titans. If not us,
then who? And if not now, when? Put your money where your mouth is:
collective action is the only way forward.
It's well and truly time to bankroll tech companies run by women and people
from marginalised populations. Australian tech company Canva - a global
goliath - is led by co-founder and CEO Melanie Perkins. Entrepreneur Shivani
Gopal is the brains behind the app ELLADEX, which mentors, educates and

guides women to grow their wealth. A proponent of 'tech for good', Gopal plans
to start her own cryptocurrency.
Cheryl Bailey leads Indigenous Technology, an IT company 100 per cent
owned and operated by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Take a look
at the Superstars of STEM website to find women like Natalie Chapman from
gemaker, a trailblazer in the sciences who's been fighting the good fight for
decades.
Despite announcing a review into diversity in STEM, the federal government
has committed no new funding for women in tech programs, according to co-
founder of the Girl Geek Academy, Sarah Moran. Let's support organisations
like the Academy, which offer workshops, courses and scholarships to 'girl
geeks'.
Obviously, targeting individuals isn't enough to create lasting change.
Sometimes I yearn for a return to the consciousness-raising days of the 1960s,
70s and 80s. During that era, discrimination was endemic: a wallpaper of
misogyny. Women often attributed their circumstances to personal failings
rather than wider structural issues. Gathering in groups in homes, parks and
halls, they realised they were not alone.
A similar truth-telling occurred during the Me Too movement, started by
Tarana Burke in 2006 before being popularised as a hashtag in 2017. Joining
together is an effective way to lobby for lasting change. Grassroots protest and
legislative reform are responsible for the great achievements of the civil rights
movement, action on climate change and every wave of feminism since the
nineteenth century.
Dealing with big hairy issues like intersectional discrimination in artificial
intelligence can seem overwhelming. This is frontier feminism. After reading
this book, your consciousness is raised. You have the information, motivation
and language to craft a short but powerful message: 'Enough!'
Talk to your family, friends and co-workers. Are you a member of a business

discussed, and pitch stories to the media. We're always seeking interesting,
future-focused content.
There are simple things you can do in your home, car, or workplace. Change
the voices of servile assistants to male instead of female. Better still, find a
'gender-neutral' option. Siri now has a non-binary voice. Open the 'Settings' app
on your iPhone or iPad and go to 'Siri & Search'. Choose 'Siri Voice' then select
'Voice 5' to switch to gender-neutral.
When buying a new vehicle, ask questions about the voice controls. What's
the accuracy rate for female voices? For people whose first language isn't
English? Or those with an accent? Take it a step further and ask about the
composition of the upper echelons of the company manufacturing the car. Most
are still stuck in the 1950s.
Perhaps you're realising your absent partner knows where you are, what
you're doing and the conversations you're having. Ask yourself these questions:
why are they so keen for me to use the Alexa? Are the lights, air conditioning
and/or heating being turned on and off? What about the time heavy metal music
screamed from the smart speaker for no apparent reason? You could be
experiencing high-tech gaslighting.
If you work in a women's shelter or law enforcement, be on alert for men
using tracking devices like Apple AirTag. As small as a coin, this can be attached
to keys and handbags or slipped into a woman's pocket. Of course, you're
probably all too aware of the latest methods being used to stalk women and girls.
Are you reeling after being rejected for a job, credit card or home loan? Don't
take it lying down. Ask follow-up questions. Was this decision made by a human
or software? If it's the latter, are the algorithms audited regularly for bias? Does
the software use historical data to make decisions? Is machine learning involved
in this process? What recourse do I have to lodge a complaint, or reapply?
It might be worthwhile contacting the Australian Human Rights
Commission or the Banking Ombudsman. Or consider taking legal action. This
book is a reminder that we live in a democracy and you have rights. Know where
you stand, take a deep breath and push back.
When you receive the results of your medical tests, maybe they don't seem
quite right. Ask your doctor whether the diagnostic machine is as accurate for

women as it is for men. Or people with disabilities, Indigenous communities, or
transgender populations.
If a clinician recommends a new drug, device or treatment, ask about the
science. Are there peer-reviewed studies? If so, what's the gender/race/age make-
up of the cohort? For example, much of the international long COVID research
is based on a male experience, through the US Department of Veterans Affairs.
With mass automation occurring in the workplace, join a union and agitate
to retain people - or at least retain human oversight. Seek legal recourse if you're
sidelined or sacked by the machines. Ask your boss whether these robots will be
as accurate, effective and productive. Play devil's advocate: what happens if
something goes wrong?
Managers, executives and board members, I hope this book gives you some
ideas about the questions you should be asking. Who are our technology
suppliers? What's their record on diversity and inclusion? Where does the data
come from? What auditing are we going to do in-house? Should bias-testing be
done externally for a more robust result? How can we continuously monitor our
algorithms to ensure they're up-to-date with society's mores?
In an era in which employers use workplace surveillance to monitor our
productivity, we often forget that we can turn the tables. Futurists predict
workers will soon be monitoring their bosses using the same tools. For example,
employees can check and record stress levels on their Garmin, Fitbit or iWatch.
Perhaps there's a place for a website to publish the results of smartwatch data
from employees at particular companies. Kinda like a high-tech Glassdoor, the
website where employees anonymously review companies. It'd be fascinating to
see the results from the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook. Talk about turning
the tables on the tech titans. Solidarity forever!
Nowadays, male allies are refusing to speak at conventions where there's an
unequal representation of genders. Advocates are highlighting this on social
media using the hashtag #Whereareallthewomen. If you work in tech and are
slated to present at a conference, ask yourself: is there someone I can nominate
instead? It might be a woman, a person of colour, or a colleague with a disability.
Ethical investors should be putting a gender lens over tech stocks. 'What's the
composition of the executive team and board?' 'How many women are involved

in research and development?' 'Does this company invest in organisations with a
history of gender or racial bias?' Talk to your bank, superannuation fund or
financial advisor about your concerns. By the end of this decade, women will
control US$30 trillion in financial assets. Yep - trillion.
Do you work in the university sector? Lecturers should be aware of the
pitfalls of using machine learning to evaluate assessments. There needs to be
human oversight. Sophisticated algorithms can pinpoint struggling students and
organise assistance. However, they can also exacerbate existing bias, further
sidelining these students.
It might be time for your uni to create a department dedicated to AI bias.
The Human Technology Institute at the University of Technology Sydney is
hitting the ground running with a world-leading report recommending reform
on facial recognition, based on international human rights law. The report urges
the federal attorney-general to lead this 'pressing' process.
Maybe you're a lawyer working in the technology field, or a judge who'll be
presiding over cases of alleged algorithmic bias. It's your job to decide what 'fair'
means as it pertains to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. So
too, insurers must adopt robust fairness criteria. One test being developed
centres on something called 'counterfactual fairness'. Yikes! What the heck is
that? Apparently, it asks AI systems this question: if attributes such as race,
gender or sexual orientation are changed, do the model's decisions remain the
same?
Where can you look for more details? The Alan Turing Institute's website is
an excellent source for information on fairness, transparency and privacy. Google
AI and Fairness 360 provide open-source toolkits to check for bias in datasets
and machine learning models. IBM's Watson OpenScale performs bias-checking
and mitigation in real time. Read the 2021 book co-authored by Dr Catriona
Wallace, Checkmate Humanity: The how and why of Responsible AI.
One easy suggestion is to include a human in the loop: an actual person
double-checking everything. The World Economic Forum wants businesses to
be aware of the three main forms of machine bias. (Yes, there are more than
three, but these are often evident in the workplace.) These are:

1. Implicit bias: A system that discriminates against a person or group on the
grounds of gender, race, disability, sexuality or social class.
2. Sampling bias: This occurs when the data used to train the machine isn't
representative of the population the machine will be servicing. For
example, we know about the problem with data from white middle-class
hospitals failing to represent non-white populations from poorer
neighbourhoods.
3. Temporal bias: Even if the AI produces fair results today, it may not do so
in the future, as circumstances change.
Put simply, we should all be aware of the 'red flags', as my teenage daughter
would say. Although she says it at the slightest provocation. I'll try to give her a
kiss on the cheek before bedtime: 'Red flag, Mum!' Gotta love Generation
Alpha. These kids really know their boundaries!
If you think speaking out about red flags will make little difference, think
again. Research by the Brookings Institution reveals public opinion is hugely
influential in relation to legislation on AI fairness, privacy and safety in the US.
Here in Australia, we're at the beginning of the conversation. We can exert
enormous influence in the coming years.
Follow the international change-makers and donate to their foundations.
Hop onto ajl.org to give money to the Algorithmic Justice League, which is
fighting for equitable and accountable artificial intelligence.
Maybe you work in voice software. Anyone who identifies as 'a female, non-
binary, genderqueer, genderfluid, gender non conforming, agender, and all
minority genders' can be part of the community at womeninvoice.org.
Bias in artificial intelligence is seen as a technical issue. But it stems from
existing biases within society. If you're uncomfortable talking about tech, bring
the dialogue back to historical inequity. Intersectional discrimination pervades
every aspect of society. If we can change the culture from the ground up, we'll
solve the problem.
When I take a television network to court for maternity discrimination,
present documentaries about the rights of women and girls, and work on
investigative stories as part of the #MeToo movement, these are not solo efforts.

It may seem like a pebble in a pond, but one person can embolden others to
speak out. This creates a ripple effect that can change the world.
During filming for the documentary Silent No More, I learn about bystander
training at Queensland's Griffith University. The MATE program teaches
people how to safely call out unacceptable behaviour. This empowers victim-
survivors and puts perpetrators on notice. What does this have to do with data,
algorithms and machine learning?
Creating environments where discrimination is not tolerated is crucial to
shifting the mindset of blithe acceptance of biased bots. Have a quiet chat with
like-minded colleagues about how you can question AI bias at the next team
meeting. Standing up for yourself is like building a muscle at the gym: the more
you do it, the stronger you become.
Hopefully, you have enough ammunition to counter the inevitable backlash:
'Now you think even the robots are biased? Crazy, hairy-legged, woke, left-wing
feminazi!' When trolls say this, my latest response is to treat is as a compliment.
Well, on the days when I have the energy to bother responding. 'Why, thank you
for noticing! Yes, I support equality in all forms. How about we sit down for a
nice cup of tea to discuss this?' Of course, they never get back to me.
If they don't believe feminists, maybe they'll listen to big business. As early as
2018, business insights giant Gartner was predicting that by the year 2030, 85
per cent of artificial intelligence projects will provide false results caused by bias.
But it doesn't have to be this way. I invite you to join a movement with its sights
set on a fairer future. A future for all of us; a future made for humans.
Collectively, we have the power to determine our destiny.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
It takes a village to write a book. I'm fortunate to be surrounded by kind, clever
and diligent people, who've helped me every step of the way.
Chrys Stevenson is one of the best researchers in the country. Without her
tenacity, intellect and global view, this book would have remained a mess of ideas
in my head. I am eternally grateful for her work and friendship.
Speaking of friendship, there are few better buddies than the legendary Selina
Day. Early readers are priceless, especially ones who are excellent subs. Thanks to
Selina's hours of toil, I was able to submit 'a lovely "clean", well-written'
manuscript, according to Simon & Schuster. Phew!
James McIlwain is a boon companion to have when you're grappling with
complex technical concepts. A solution architect with a development
background, Jim shares a similar sense of humour, which is priceless when
dissecting the absurdity of this brave new world. A thousand thanks.
My clever publisher, Emma Nolan, was one of the first people to see the
potential for this book. Her enthusiasm, hard work and big picture thinking
brought this project to fruition. The publishing deal wouldn't have happened
without the chutzpah of literary agent, Jacinta di Mase. I am forever indebted to
Jacinta for supporting my dream.
Managing Editor Michelle Swainson is an absolute gun for keeping us on
schedule during a global pandemic. I'm especially thankful for Michelle's wit
and wisdom during the editing process. Her instincts are bang on.
If you look up 'forensic' in the dictionary, there's a photo of copyeditor Katie
Stackhouse. Katie has an incredible eye for detail, and the patience of a saint. If
there are any mistakes in Man-Made they are surely mine, not Katie's!
The cover designer, Meng Koach, is an utterly delightful fella. His idea to
create the image using artificial intelligence was genius. It was a joy immersing
ourselves for hours in the digital space.

Special thanks to everyone who kindly agreed to be interviewed for this book,
and the countless academics and technologists who I've quoted throughout its
pages. You are the experts in this area. It's a privilege to be able to platform your
powerful work.
I'm not gonna lie: this was the 'difficult second book'. During the first two
years of the researching and interviewing process, I was struggling with a major
depressive disorder due to vicarious trauma. While writing the final chapters and
going through the rounds of editing, I was living with long COVID.
Wholehearted thanks to my loyal clients, who moved heaven and earth so I could
keep working during this time, albeit in a severely reduced capacity.
To the family, friends and fellow travellers who came to stay, cooked meals,
sent care packs, supported long COVID advocacy, or simply called to make me
laugh, how can I ever thank you? You kept me sane! I'm blessed to have a
beautiful sister, Suzanne, who flew interstate several times to nurse me back to
health. She is a rare gem, indeed.
Mostly, I'd like to thank my lovely hubby Jason, our terrific teens Taj and
Grace, and border collie, Arabella. For almost a year they did pretty much
everything around the house, while I languished in bed. They put my broken
body back together again. Put simply, they are my everything.

GLOSSARY
'By far the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early
that they understand it.'
Eliezer Yudkowsky, autodidact and artificial intelligence researcher
Algorithm:
A set of rules a machine can follow to learn how to do a task or solve a
problem. We use algorithmic thinking every single day of our lives.
Examples include using a recipe to make a meal, working out how to sort a
pile of papers or following a step-by-step process in order to tie our
shoelaces.
Artificial intelligence:
This refers to the concept of machines acting in a way that simulates
human intelligence. Fun fact: there is no such thing as 'one' AI; there are
many types of artificial intelligence. AI can have a variety of features,
including communication or decision-making.
Autonomous:
When a machine can perform tasks without human intervention, it's
described as 'autonomy'. Think self-driving cars, smart assistants and
manufacturing robots. While autonomy is enabled by artificial intelligence,
not all uses of AI are necessarily autonomous.
Backward chaining:
A method in which the model starts with the desired output and works in
reverse to find data that might support it. You start by breaking the task
into small steps. Then you do the last step first, working backwards from
your goal.
Bias:

I cover this at length in the book. Machine bias is caused by a combination
of human bias, and assumptions made by a model that simplifies the
process of learning. These biases are exacerbated as the machine continues
to stereotype different pieces of information.
Big data:
These are datasets that are too big or complex to be managed by traditional
processing software. But they are extremely valuable. Big data can be used
to address business problems that are unsolvable using any other method.
Chatbot:
From Siri to Alexa and beyond, these programs are designed to
communicate with people using text or voice commands. Chatbots are
supposed to mimic human-to-human conversation, but often fall far short.
Data science:
Drawing from statistics, and computer and information science, this
interdisciplinary field uses modern techniques to sift through volumes of
data. This is aimed at finding unseen patterns. Machine learning algorithms
are used to make predictive models.
Dataset:
This is a collection of numbers or values relating to a specific subject. It
could be students' test scores from a particular class or patients' medical
results from a hospital department. Categories of datasets include record
data, graph-based data and ordered data.
Deep learning:
Strap yourself in! This is a type of machine learning based on artificial
neural networks. These neural networks try to simulate the human brain.
Many layers of processing are used to extract high-level features from raw
data. Facial recognition, vision for driverless cars and virtual assistants are
examples of deep learning.
Entity annotation:

Annotators label unstructured sentences with information, so a machine
can read them. This can involve labelling all people, organisations, and
locations in a document. AI systems then learn to make sense of these
images, videos, and text. As you can probably guess, annotation is open to
all sorts of bias.
General AI:
Also called 'artificial general intelligence'. This is a theoretical form of AI
that could do sophisticated cognitive tasks of similar breadth and diversity
to human capabilities. It's sometimes referred to as 'strong AI', although
they aren't entirely equivalent terms. General AI is likely to emerge
between 2030 and 2100.
Machine learning:
This subset of artificial intelligence is particularly focused on developing
algorithms that will help machines to learn and change in response to new
data without the help of a human being. The autonomous aspect of
machine learning has many people concerned.
Narrow AI:
This is artificial intelligence that is capable of specific tasks, such as
searching the internet, diagnosing illness, screening applicants for a
position, or operating a vehicle. Machine learning is a subset of this
category.
Neural network:
Also called a neural net. This is a computer system designed to function
like the human brain. Current neural networks can perform a variety of
tasks involving speech, vision and game strategy.
Python:
No, this is not a type of snake. Python is a popular computer programming
language. This is the first programming language my son, Taj, learned, as
it's often taught to beginners. It's also one of the most widely used in the
world.

Turing test:
Named after computer scientist and mathematician Alan Turing, this tests
a machine's ability to pass for a human. This is especially relevant in the
areas of language and behaviour. A person 'passes' the machine if its
output is unable to be distinguished from that of a human.

The cover image for Man-Made was created using Midjourney, an AI art generator that produced original
images based on text prompts submitted by the cover designer, Meng Koach. AI generators use algorithms
or 'neural networks' to analyse hundreds of millions of images online and compose all-new material based
on the machine's understanding of the text. This process is evidently open to bias, and raises ethical
questions about authorship, as discussed in Man-Made.
