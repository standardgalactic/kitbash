Scientists estimate that over 6 million fungal species exist in nature.
 
T

 only 
120,
000 species of fungi ha
ve b een identifie d, 
which means that 98 per cent are 
still to be discovered.

 took creative licence with some of the illustrations to 
imagine the diversity of f
orms that could exist in the fungi kingdom.
The cover image is an imagined mushroom, reflecting fungi'
s role as creative 
architects and alchemists in the natural world.
The chapter opener images portray organic landscapes that prop ose possible 
futures,
 or alternative presents,
 in which fungi have continued to colonise and 
thrive.
They depict a world w
here fungi'
s
indispensable
role in our universe is seen 
and understood.
The mushroom profile images illustrated on black backgrounds ha
ve b een 
modelled as scientifically accurate representations of known fungal species.
All illustrations in this book
,
 
except two diagrams,
 were created by Joana 
Huguenin as 3D artworks, 
using mathematical models to simulate various f
orms 
before applying tex
tures,
 c olours and lighting.
 The digital approach reflects 
the marriage of nature and technology that'
s helping us discover
,
 catalogue and 
understand all of the fungal species in nature.

One of the core members 
of the Harvard Psilocybin 
Project in 1960-
1963,  
Dr Gunther W
eil worked 
closely with Timothy L eary
,
 
Richard Alpert (aka Ram 
Dass)
, R alph Metzner and 
George Litwin on pioneering 
psychedelics research. 
He 
received his doctorate from 
Harvard University in 1965.
 
He was a Fulbright Scholar  
in Europe and was recruited 
by Abraham Maslow to 
teach at Brandeis University
.
 
He is the f
ounder and CEO 
of V
alue Mentors and an 
internationally recognised 
organisational consultant,
 
executive coach and  
educator that advises leaders 
and their organisations on 
values-based leadership,
 
innovation, 
team building,
 
and executive wellness.
 
I was twenty-three when I had my first 
psilocybin experience in the autumn 
of 1960.
 The setting was the plush 
living room of a mansion in N
ewton,
 
Massachusetts,
 leased by my Harvard 
University faculty adviser
, D
r Timothy 
L e a r y
.
 
Tim was f
ort y years old, in his 
second year of a faculty appointment 
as a lecturer in clinical psychology 
in what was then the Harvard 
Department of Social Relations. In the 
f i r s t  y e a r  o f  o u r  H a r va r d  P s i l o c y bin  
Research Project,
 this living room,
 
decorated with Indian prints,
 images 
of the sacred arts and an audiophile-
quality sound system, was the hub f
or 
near-we ekly psilocybin sessions that 
drew many interesting characters.
 
On the day of my virgin 
psychedelic experience,
 I shared  
the company of Matthew Huxley 
(Aldous H
uxley
'
s son),
 
A
l
len Ginsberg 
and his partner Peter Orlovsky
,
 
 
Dr Richard 
Alpert (later known  
as Ram Dass
), R alph Metzner
, T
im, 
and his close friend and psychologist 
colleague,
 Frank Barron.
 
My first 
psilocybin experience was deeply 
transformational and altered the 
trajectory of my life.
The psilocybin session was a 
deep experience of unitive (
non- dual) 
consciousness: that is,
 the quantum 
interconnectedness of all phenomena.
 
I explored multiple layers and levels 
of this consciousness.
 I realised that 
my lif
e experiences up to that point 
were just a very small fraction of the 
range of possibilities offered by de eper 
lenses of consciousness.
 I was able 
to disconnect from the ego- centre d, 
little-me self and see more objectively
,
 
and with bemusement,
 
the 'Gunther'
 
character and how he operated through 
his ethnic and culturally inherited,
 
condition ed worl d  v i e w  
- wh i c h   
I define as the unconscious lenses,
 
beliefs or assumptions through w
hich 
we look at lif
e.
These experiences were a massive 
t u r n i n g  p o i n t  i n  my world  v i e w
.
 
 
I observed the unconscious framework 
of how my life was run,
 programmed 
by a variety of life experiences,
 
including childhood traumas.
 
Everything I had learned and believed 
up to that point got turned inside out.
In our first meeting,
 Tim, 
nattily dressed in a prof
essorial 
tweed sport coat,
 
khaki pants and 
sneakers, e
nthusiastically shared his 
transformational epiphanies and 
revelations from his first psilocybin 
experience the previous summer in 
Cuernava c a ,
 Mexico.
 Since then,
 he 
had devoted himself to studying the 
role that psychedelics could play in 
understanding consciousness and  
the human brain,
 nervous system  
and psychology
.
 
Tim was boyishly handsome,
 
seductively charming,
 witty and ver y  
smart.
 He graciously said,
 'I f you're 
interested,
 then I'm happy to be your 
advisor
.
 
If you're not, you're better  
off working with someone else.
'
 
I had an immediate, i
ntuitive 
response.
 'C
ount me in!'
 With that 
declaration I became one of the core 
Harvard Psilocybin Project team 
members.
 The team included Ralph 
Metzner and George Litwin, who  
were also graduate students, 
and  
Dr Richard 
Alpert.

explorations by European artists. 
I later realised how my 
upbringing,
 e ducation and life 
experiences primed me to meet  
Tim and join the Harvard Psilocybin 
Project team.
 M
y parents and  
I fled Nazi Germany in late 1939  
on one of the last immigration boats
.
 
 
I was two years old. In the United 
States,
 I was raised in a middl e - class,
 
academic and musically gifted Jewish 
family that suppor ted my intellectual 
and creative interests. 
I was alwa
ys 
highly curious and inquisitiv
e.
 
In 
fact, to this day
,
 
one of my core values 
centres on searching for life'
s meaning.
 
I grew up in the bebop era in the 1950s,
 
hanging out in jazz clubs in Milwaukee 
and Chicago in my mid and late teens.
  
I was introduced to cannabis by my jazz 
musician friends and experienced many 
enhanced cognitiv
e and sensory flow 
states and epiphanies.
 I graduated from 
K
e
n
y
o
n
 College in 1959 with a dual 
major in philosophy and psy
chology
.
 
 
In the academic interim year of 1959  
to 1960,
 befo re entering graduate  
school at Harvard
,
 
I was awarded a 
Fulbright scholarship at  the University 
of Oslo in Norway
.
 
Throughout that 
year I spent exten ded periods of time  
in Paris,
 hanging out in the jazz  
scene with a variety of expat  
American artists.
During my first three years at 
Harvard ,
 
I was involved in many 
psilocybin sessions. 
It was early on and 
we were  j u st trying to understand the 
multiple dimensions of the psychedelic 
experience. I
t was like visiting another 
planet,
 observing and participating 
at the same time, a
nd then writing 
about it like anthropologists.
 
W
e
 
were essentially learning '
on the job'
.
 
Our individual and collective shared 
purpose was discovering what these 
substances could offer with respect  
t o  t h e  e x p a n s i o n  o f  c on s c i o u s n e s s  
for healing and for scientific and 
artistic discove r y
.
W
e
 
defined 
'
s
e
t' as the internal 
intentions,
 b eliefs,
 expectations 
a n d  m i n d s e t  t h a t  p e op l e  b r i n g  t o  
t h e  p s y c h e de l i c  e x p e rience. W
e
 
defined '
set t i n g '
 as the physical space,
 
atmosphere
,
 
location and aesthetics 
of the environment;
 i t '
s the external 
sensory input -
 the sounds,
 smells,
 
visuals,
 etc.
In order to maximise a positive 
transformational experience, we 
needed to minimise f
ear and anxiety in 
the participants
.
 
This involved creating 
a comfortable setting of sensory and 
cognitive ease and emotional safet y
.
 
 
I t  w a s  cl e a r  t o  u s  t h at  e v e ryon e  h a d

them, so we understood that,
 
generally
,
 
'less is more' 
when guiding psychedelic 
sessions.
 
W
e
 were learning to guide  
by intuition, informed directly by  
our own personal exp eriences.
W
e
 
were explorers who were 
on the cutting edge of psychedelic 
research.
 
W
e
 embraced the belief that 
what we were doing was extremely 
important for understanding 
human consciousness,
 and that we 
were destined to change and raise 
consciousness for the betterment of 
all. W
e
 were convinced that we had the 
ultimate to ol, 
declaring psilocybin to 
be a high-powered electron microscope 
that could be used to enter into hidden 
dimensions of consciousness.
 
Tim, by nature a rebellious Black 
Irish poet,
 was intellectually daring,
 
contemptuous of dogma and arbitrary 
institutional authorit y
,
 
and had an 
unflinching faith that psychedelics 
were going to change the world.  
He was acutely aware that great 
prophets are usually not understood  
or welcomed in their time.
When Tim and Richard Alper t  
were fired by Harvard in 1963,
 they 
moved to Millbro ok, 
a historic sixty-
four-room estate in upstate New Y
o
rk 
on 2300 acres, r
ented to Tim by Peg g y

Since psychedelics had bec ome 
taboo at Harvard ,
 
I had to switch my 
thesis fo cus in order to graduate the 
following year
. U pon graduation in 
1965, I accepted a teaching role at 
Brandeis University offered to me  
by Abraham Maslow
,
 
known by most  
for his '
hierarchy of needs'
 and widely 
considered the father of humanistic 
psycholog y
.
 
Abe was studying peak 
experiences
,
 
and since I was in the 
business of creating them,
 we bonded. 
A year into my multiple year contract,
 
much to Abe'
s disapp ointment,
 I felt 
the urge to join my old Harvard team.
 
In June 1966,
 I resigned my Brandeis 
faculty app ointment and moved my 
wife and two children to Millbrook  
to join Tim and Richard .
It was an exciting and seminal 
time at Millbrook. Streams of people 
from the arts
,
 
sciences,
 literature and 
many other walks of lif
e came through 
the large stone gateway towers of the  
estate.
 They included personages such 
as 
Alan 
W
at ts, 
Allen Ginsberg,
D izzy 
Gillespie and Charles Mingus.
 They 
tended to be people who were creative 
and adventurous risk
-takers.
 That'
s 
not to say the Millbrook exp erience 
was easy
.
 
Nina Graboi,
 
an early 
close supp orter and collaborator in 
the League for Spiritual Discove r y
,
 
described Millbrook as 
'a cross 
between a country club, 
a madhouse,
  
a research institute, a monastery
,
 
 
and a Fellini movie set'
.
1
 My wife a nd 
I agreed that Millbro ok wasn'
t an 
environment to raise our children in.
One night,
 
a month or so after 
arriving in Millbrook,
 I had a highly 
lucid, prophetic dream. I immediately 
knew that if I stayed there it would b e 
destructive to myself and my family
.
 
 
I  w a s  a  2 7
-yea r - o l d  h u s b a n d  a n d  a  
f a t h e r  o f  t wo youn g  c h i l d r e n ,
 a n d  I   
felt the need to resume my professional 
life.
 
After only several months, 
I left 
Millbrook to return to Cambridge and 
resume an ordinary life. S

qi gong and tai chi.
I believe I am the last 
representative of the original core 
Harvard Psilocybin Project team.
 
Given this legacy
,
 
I hope to share my 
learnings and insights as I reflect back 
on the psychedelic experiences of my 
early lif
e
.
 
W
ho would have thought 
that these explorations were made 
possible by the kingdom of fungi: 
that the pre cursor to LS D lay hidden 
within the ergot fungus,
 and that the 
inconspicuous psilocybin mushroom 
grows ubiquitously in the wild around 
the world .
One of my major lif
e learnings  
is the understanding that whenever  
a massive shift in world views occurs,
 
the associate d values of the new 
world view accompany it.
 In my 
life,
 
I embrace values such as love
, 
transcendence,
 oneness,
 c ompassion, 
empathy and collab oration. 
But it 
is very important to understand 
that while psychedelics clearly ha
ve 
the potential to temporarily open 
a portal 
- t
hey can show you the 
possibilities of abiding in inner 
freedom 
- t
hey do not sustainably 
establish that freedom. 
Essentially
,
 
you have a f
ew hours of experiencing 
deeper insights and a similitude of 
inner freedom.
 
I was able to see the 
beautiful mystery and the pervasive 
love that supports the manif
ested 
universe,
 including this gigantic 
movie that we'
re all in.
 However
, i
t 
is dangerous to rely on psychedelics 
to keep repeating a certain kind of 
spiritual or transcendent experience. 
Y
o
u can easily get trappe d pursuing 
endless psychedelic experiences,
 w
hich 
becomes a dangerous spiritual and 
psychological dead end.
 The real work 
of integrating psychospiritual insights 
and a more generative world view and 
its associated values and behaviour 
begins after the psychedelic session.
This integration involves 
deconstructing faulty beliefs,
 attitudes

For me, t
here is an unmistakable 
direct line from my Harvard 
psychedelic experiences of my mid-
twenties to my sixty years of inner 
work with psychospiritual disciplines 
including the Gurdjieff W
ork, 
Buddhist,
T
aoist  a n d
V
e dic 
Advaita 
teachings and practices,
 as well as the 
martial and healing arts of qi gong and 
tai chi.
 It '
s only in the last few years,
 
stimulated by the current psychedelic 
renaissance,
 that I ha
ve explored the 
psilocybin journey again,
 but with  
very specific intentions. At this stage  
of my lif
e
,
 
approaching eighty-five, 
 
I'm  explor
ing my f
elt sense of mortality 
while continuing to heal some residual 
traumatic elements stemming from the 
Holocaust experiences of my parents 
and myself when I was a child.
I have devoted many years of my 
life to exploring human consciousness.
 
But psychedelics are just one of the 
phenomenal arcs of fungal creation. 
They also shape the natural world, 
produce lif
e - saving medicine,
 and 
create some of our favourite cuisines.
 
Interestingly
,
 
if I map the fungi 
kingdom to Maslow'
s hierarchy of 
needs,
 fungi can help us meet many 
innumerable biotechnological and 
mycoremediation solutions for 
decontaminating the environment. 
Psychedelics take us on a journey of 
inner worlds to experience conscious 
love and self-transcendence of the 
'little me'
.
 
Fungi ha
ve wideranging 
potential that permeates the human 
experience, a
nd this book has placed 
the human-fungus connection at the 
centre of all of it.
Michael and Y
un have created a 
fascinating,
 refreshing and inf
ectiously 
thought-provoking exploration of 
fungi. They find keys to the future by 
follow i n g  t h e  e volution a r y  r o o t s  o f  
fungi from the past to modern-day 
research and applications.
 There is 
wisdom to be found in these pages as 
they share their wonder and a
we about 
a billion-year- old kingdom that has 
refined its survival strategies in a vast,
 
collaborative network of deep ecology
.
 
This book is a rediscovery of our 
relationship with ourselves, 
nature and 
the world around us.
 O nly then can we 
realistically and practically explore the 
possibility o f  c o - creating a future that 
is as enduring,
 resilient and creative as 
that of the fungi kingdom.

time. 
Without

flourish 
into 
their 
truest 
expression.
Nature

The 
kingdom
of 
fungi 
embodies 
the 
pinnacle 
of
this 
design,
underpinning 
life on 
Earth 
f
or 
over 
a billion

With 
each 
fine 
thread 
of 
mycelium,
fungi 
wea
ve 
t he 
tapestry
of 
the 
living 
wo rld.
Fungi 
have 
long 
been 
the 
architects 
and 
alchemists 
of 
the 
natural 
world. For 
thousands 
of 
years, humans 
have 
harnessed 
their 
molecular 
powers 
to 
turn 
wheat 
into 
bread, 
and 
fruit 
into
wine 
-
and 
our 
lives 
are 
richer 
for 
it. 
Advances 
in 
technology 
since
the 
mid-20th century have accelerated the study of fungi 
- mycology -
into 
a 
biotechnology
revolution 
that
has endless potential to enrich 
our world.
 
In 
these 
pages,
we 
explore 
how 
fungi 
can 
be 
leveraged 
to 
transform 
matter 
into 
a 
diverse 
set 
of 
radical 
solutions 
for 
today
'
s
urgent 
ecological 
and 
social 
issues.
Fungi 
are 
being 
engineered 
to 
increase 
food 
production, grow 
future 
meat 
alternatives, 
c
reate 
new 
sources 
of 
medicine, 
produce 
sustainable 
biomaterials,
remediate 
the environment and change our state of consciousness.
Fungi traverse every corner of the globe
and can even survive 
in 
outer 
space.
They 
provide
endless 
lessons 
in 
ecology
that 
defy 
our 
traditional 
notions 
of
what 
it 
means 
to 
be 
intelligent.
Fungi 
redefine 
resourcefulness,
collaboration,
resilience 
and 
symbiosis.
Fungi 
have 
survived 
all 
five 
mass 
extinction 
events 
and 
provide 
innovative solutions for thriving on
our planet.
Y
e
t we know much 
less about fungi than we do about the animal and plant kingdoms.
 
The 
future 
of 
fungi 
permeates 
all
disciplines 
and 
business 
models.
Their 
allure 
not 
only 
lies 
with 
researchers 
uncovering
applications for the future but extends to capitalists creating value 
in 
the 
burgeoning 
fields 
of 
food 
and

transpired from our enduring fascination
with 
fungi 
and 
the 
human 
condition. 
In 
true 
mycelial 
style,
discussions 
about

quickly 
radiated
into 
an 
exploration 
of 
history
,
 
science,

W

are 
driven 
by 
a 
desire 
to 
speak 
for 
a 
hidden
yet 
extraordinary 
kingdom 
that 
doesn'
t 
express 
itself 
using 
words. 
This 
is 
a 
book 
about 
fungi 
and 
a 
future 
that 
embraces 
their 
wisdom.
 
It 
is 
also 
an 
invitation 
to 
discover 
a
deeper 
awareness 
of 
yourself
.
 
To 
be 
a 
breathing, 
conscious
being 
means 
that 
it 
is 
our 
obligation
to make sense of the world and our role in it. 
W
e hope to share our 
anthropological curiosity
by using fungi as a vehicle to investigate 
and reckon with our role in this small slice of time and space.
Perfe ction is the
enemy of progress,
so this is by no means an 
exhaustive 
exploration.
 
This 
is 
simply 
one 
of 
many 
expedit ions 
using fungi to explore the far reaches of our world and our minds. 
Nature 
gave
us 
the 
magic 
of 
consciousness,
so 
we 
hop e 
that 
you 
find a new concept in this book,
 
give it a spin and observe it.
 
Fungi 
teach 
us
that 
we
are 
all 
interdependent.
When 
we 
finally
surrender 
our 
separateness,
we 
realise 
that 
we
are 
not 
outside 
of 
nature,
 but within it.

Despite

best appreciate the importance of fungi,
 le t '
s start at the intersection 
of science and histor y
.
 
Our Earth is 4.5 billion years old. The tree of life can be traced 
back to LUCA
 
-
 
the Last Universal Common Ancestor 
- s
ome 4 billion 
years ago.
2
 The earliest living organisms were basic, single- celle d 
prokaryotes. 
Single- celle d organisms are the smallest thing you can  
be and still be considered a living organism.
 They are represented by 
the domains 
Archa
ea
 and 
Bacteria
.
 
T rees
,
 
birds,
 insects and fish,
 as  
we know them today
,
 
did not exist.
 
Over millions of years,
 to survive the changes in Earth'
s 
conditions
,
 
prokaryotes fused into larger and more complex living 
organisms called eukaryotes, enabling the diversity of nature that we 
see today
.
 
Eukaryotes form the domain 
Eukaryota
, w hich is organised 
into four kingdoms: 
Plantae
 (plants
)
,
 
Animalia
 (animals),
 
Fungi
 and 
Protista
 
(
e
verything else
). H umans are mammals,
 and sit within the 
kingdom of 
Animalia
, a
long with all other animals from electric eels  
to elephants. 
It is humbling to contemplate that all life,
 
be it an oak  
tree or Gandhi,
 descended from the same primitive organisms.
Fungi diverged from animals 1 billion years ago.
 S o close are 
the 
Fungi
 and 
Animalia
 kingdoms that taxonomists speak of a super-
kingdom that combines the two:
 
Opisthokonta
. 
T
his billion-year - o ld 
divergence
was only
recognised in 1969 when ecologist R
obert
Harding 
Whittaker formalised their importance, scale and diversity with the 
new kingdom classification. 
Previously
,
 
fungi were classified as plants, 
and dismissed as lowe r - class organisms,
 tucked away  in an obscure 
corner of the botany department.
 
As Whittaker recognised,
 fungi are more closely related to 
animals than plants. 
Say hello to your evolutionary cousin 
- we share 
almost 50 per cent of our DNA
 with fungi. The basic building blocks 
of fungal cell walls are chitin, the same material as the hard shells of 
crustaceans and insects.
 The cell walls of plants, 
in contrast,
 are built 
from cellulose. Like animals, 
and unlike plants,
 fungi are heterotrophs 
- t
hey are unable to produce their own f
oo d and must instead obtain 
food from their environment. Animals opted to internalise their 
stomachs,
 w
hile fungi pursued external ones. They secrete enzymes 
into the environment to digest fo od externally bef
ore absorbing it 
into their cel ls. 
Fungi also ha
ve a remarkably wider taste palette than

biotechnolog y

and has applications in environmental remediation.
Fungi are inherently difficult to study in nature, as the majorit y 
of species are microscopic or underground, but myc ologists ha
ve made 
great strides in recent decades.
 
T
e
chnological advances make it p ossible 
to identify fungal DNA i n the environment.
 Unfortunately
,
 
the DNA
 
doesn't match any records because a comprehensive catalogue of fungal 
DNA does not yet exist.
 Even once catalogued ,
 
the species could sit in 
a fungarium for decades before funding is granted to understand their 
role in nature, their interactions and how they fit into the tree of lif
e.
T
o
 
da
t
e, 
only 120
,
0
0 0 species of fungi ha
ve been identified
.
 
Using 
a complex process called DN
A b arcoding,
 scientists estimate that over 
6 million fungal species exist in na
ture, 
which means that 98 per cent are 
still to be discov
ered,
 highlighting the untap
ped potential of my
cology
.
3
 
Every year
,
 
a
 few  thousand new species are described.
 
A
t
 
this rate,
 it 
will take more than a thousand years to identify all the fungi on Earth. 
M
y
c
ologists obviously aren'
t running out of new species to discov
e
r
 
- 
the limiting factor is simply that  there aren'
t enough my
cologists.
 The 
practice of cultivating mushrooms,
 
o
r myc oculture,
 also has an engaged 
citizen scientist community that pushes the field fo rward.

sites such 
as iNaturalist and Mushro om Observer allow amateur mycologists and 
enthusiasts to log the mushrooms that they find to generate data on 
fungi diversity and conservation.

and plants,
 but discoveries are underway

In fact,
 fungi rarely leave

grassroots

The kingdom of fungi is incredibly diverse. 
Beyond the popular images  
of cap and stem mushrooms
,
 
there are clubs
,
 
corals,
 shells and balls, j
ust  
to name a fe
w
.
 
And mushrooms are
 just th e tip of the meta
p
ho
ri
ca
l iceberg.
 
In fact, only 10 per cent of (known) fungi produce mushrooms.
 
Y
e
asts,
 moulds and mildews are all fungi,
 yet most of these are invisible 
to the naked eye and don't 
produce mushrooms at all. Mushrooms 
are simply the reproductive organ of an extensive fungal network. 
Thinking of fungi as being only mushrooms is like thinking of people 
as being only their genitals.
 
Turn over a pile of leaves in a forest and you'l l almost certainly 
see white, 
furry patches hitched to their underside.
 
T
hese white, 
cottony masses are mycelia,
 w
hich are made up of individual strands  
of thread-like hyphae.
 M
ycelium and hyphae comp ose the growing  
and fe eding part of the fungus 
- a
lso known as the vegetative stage. 
This structure typically exists within soils. 
It allows the fungus to 
search for fo od but it also creates and aerates soils that benefit the rest 
of the ecosystem. Hyphae are most visible when they fuse,
 flood with 
water and produce mushrooms, 
which are recognisable as pualls,
 
morels, death caps and so on. 
Fungi encompass both the mushroom and the myc elium. Repeat 
after me: all mushrooms are fungi,
 but not all fungi are mushrooms.
Mushrooms serve one biological purpose:
 reproduction.
 They 
contain spores, 
the reproductive units of fungi that function like the 
seeds of plants. 
Mushrooms come in various shap es, 
colours and sizes,
 
but they all ha
ve just one function 
- t
o release their spores far and wide.

Species of fungi that produce mushrooms for reproduction are 
macrofungi. The overwhelming majority that do

bodies are called microfungi. 
Aptly named,
 their reproduction process 
is typically invisible to the naked eye

 adapt to constantly changing 
environments, fungi other than yeasts maximise their survival by 
shuffling the genetic deck of cards. 
Through sex, 
these fungi develop 
new forms, feat ures and chemistries.
Sex in the fungi kingdom is genuinely remarkable.
 If you peer at  
a fungus under a microscope, there is no sexual differentiation.

Scientists believe that microbial communities of fungi,
 bacteria 
and perhaps algae first lived on land 1 billion years ago.
5
 Fungi survived 
by using penetrative and chemical strategies to mine minerals and 
water from rocks,
 w
hich slowly disassembled the dense,
 c omplex 
structures into  soil.
 They were the earliest colonists of a hostile 
landscape and they laid the groundwork for the ancestors of plants  
that arrived onshore a f
ew hundred million years later
.
 
These early plants were green algae,
 w
hich had the abilit y to 
photosynthesise and produce their own sugars using the sun'
s energy
.
 
At first, they couldn'
t venture far from the oc ean, as they had not yet 
forme d root systems to access water and vital nutrients from the soil.
6
A principle of nature is thrift - its processes happ en in a way that 
requires the least eff
ort.
 
As competition for resources increased in the 
oceans,
 fungi and early plants formed a symbiotic partnership to ensure 
their mutual survival as they established themselves on the unchartered 
territory of land.
 An economic trade was f
orged: plants shared their 
sugars with fungi,
 w
hile fungi shared minerals and water with the 
plants,
 acting as their root systems.
 This was a physical partnership 
- p lants allowed mycelium to grow and occupy space inside their 
cells to facilitate the transfer
.
 
Fungi reciprocated by granting plants 
access to their mycelium.
 This was an easier wa
y for plants to access 
micronutrients and water as they move d awa
y from the ocean.

Over millions of years,
 plants evolved their own root systems.
 
They also formed lignin, the hard structural component in wood  
that allows trees to grow tall and dominate forest ecosystems.
 Fungi  
c o - e v olved with plants, a
nd developed the unique ability to decompose 
lignin,
 capitalising on this new and abundant fo od source.
 This ability 
was instrumental to recycling matter 
- i
t allows the forest ecosystem  
to continue through cy
cles of birth,
 growth and decay
.
 
The atmosphere'
s 
composition also transformed as more plants inhaled carbon dioxide  
and pumped out ox ygen,
 allowing f
or the growth of animals.
The long and enduring partnership between fungi and plants has 
fundamentally shap ed the natural world and opened the door f
or the 
evolution of all plants and animals on land.
 Life doesn'
t always compete 
for resources as individuals.
 Symbiosis has also been a powerful tool for 
evolutio
n

plants from intertwining their evolutionary histories.

Greek

'root
'
Mycor rhizal fungi are networks of  underground mycelium that 
interact with the root systems of  plants.
 They are the most widespread 
organisms in soil,
9
 and as many as 92 per cent of all land plants have  
a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi.
10
 Fungi share nutrients and 
water with plants in exchange for sugars.
 Although most modern plants 
are self-sufficient, their roots are much thicker than mycelium,
 making 
soil navigation to extract nutrients and water cumbersome. Mycelium  
is only one cell wall thick and can easily extract nutrients from a range  
of complex materials,
 breaking them into elementary substances  
such as water
, c
arbon dioxide,
 nitrogen,
 phosphor us and calcium 
-  
all superfoods that allow plants to flourish.

 'what eats around itself
'
Lichens are a marriage between fungi and photosynthesising algae or 
bacteria.
 Fungi offer the algae or bacteria protection and shelter
, a
nd 
in return the fungi receive a steady source of  nourishment.
 This union 
is the ultimate example of symbiosis 
- l
ichens live in habitats that 
neither fungi nor algae could survive alone
.
 
As such, 
lichens are studie d 
as a single organism,
 pushing the boundaries of what constitutes an 
individual.
 N
ew research suggests that a third critical player
,
 
yeasts,
 
may also be entwined in this symbiosis.
It'
s not certain exactly when lichens evolved.
 Estimates range 
from 400 million years ago,
 during the early colonisation of land,
 
to 250 million years ago, a
fter plants had established themselves on 
land. 
As extremophiles 
- o rganisms that live in extreme conditions 
- l
ichens grow everyw
here and dominate 8 per cent of the Earth'
s 
surface.
11
 This area is more than the combined size of Canada and 
the US,
 or all of Europe. Visually unique yet unassuming,
 lichens 
challenge the notion of w
hat it means to be alive
.
 
They are able to 
survive complete dehydration and lie dormant between life and death,
 
in bleak conditions,
 only to come back to life once rehydrated. This 
enduring and sophisticated partnership is also of significant ecological 
importance: lichens break down rocks into soil,
 c ontribute to nutrient 
and water cycling,
 and provide nests and food for wildlif
e.

Parasitic fungi weaken or even kill living hosts by causing disease and

 In humans,
 parasitic fungi usually enter through a wound

such as athlete'

media coverage due to their impacts on f

Spores are the beginning and end of the fungal life cycle.
 These single-
celled units contain the code for a new fungal individual to flourish.
 
Faced with countless microbial competitors and tough environmental 
conditions
,
 
the odds of germination are extremely low
,
 
so fungi release 
trillions of spores.
 They remain suspended in a state between lif
e and 
death, monitoring the world around them for the right home
.
 
Spores 
are microscopic and so ubiquitous that there is no avoiding them -
  
we all inhale ten spores with each breath.

Fuelled by the 
desire to propagate their DNA ,
 
some species of fungi have employed 
ingenious strategies to ensure their spores proliferate in new areas.

When a spore lands in a place that is not too hot,
 not too cold, 
near 
food and near water
, i
t will germinate. 
The spore absorbs water  
through the cell walls,
 and a thread-like tube called a hypha extends.  
As the hypha grows on a nutrient source, c
alled the substrate, 
more 
hyphae branch out and create a string.
 The hyphae continue to eat 
through the substrate,
 w
hich might be wo o d ,
 insects or soil, 
and  
more hyphae grow from the tips, f
using and connecting to for m  
an interconnected matrix called mycelium.
The growth of each hypha has combined physical f
orce with a 
chemical strategy: hyphae secrete enzymes, w hich are strong digestive 
acids that break down matter
.
 
T
his makes fungi adept at penetrating 
through the toughest of substrates to extract the nutrients before 
transferring them into their mycelium.
 These acids are similar to 
those in our mouth - leave a piece of bread on your tongue and within 
seconds,
 enzymes in your saliva will turn the bread into a wet mush.

nutrition sources and grows towards the fo od in a circular f
ormation 
to maximise its surface area. When the foo d source in one area is 
exhausted ,
 
the inner mycelium is cannibalised and resources are 
redirected to the outer circle
.
 
Mycelium effe ctively grows as an 
expanding hollow ring. 
This is why you sometimes find 
'fa iry rings' 
in grasslands.
 The centre dies out as resources are redirected to the 
outer edges, g
radually increasing the circumf
erence of the ring.
 The 
mycelium can continue to grow in this way as long as nutrients and 
water are a
vailable.
During this stage,
 fungi other than yeasts can reproduce asexually 
by releasing spores from their mycelium.
 Microfungi such as moulds, 
rusts and mildew always reproduce this way

When environmental conditions are

macrofungi can also reproduce sexually

When two sexually compatible 
mycelia meet,
 they fuse,
 f
orming a larger mass. Th is new mycelium,
 
now genetically diverse, w aits for the right conditions to compress its 
hyphae and inflate them with water to create a pinhead,
 known as a 
primordium.
 O ver a f
ew da
ys, 
the primordium gradually elongates its 
stipe (the stalk-like part of the mushroom), w hich pushes the cap above 
the surface of the substrate
.
 
Finally
,
 
the cap opens,
 and it transforms 
into a fully grown mushroom. The mushroom can vary wildly in 
colour
, t
exture and shape,
 depending on the species.
Macrofungi are typically split into two groups based on how the 
mushrooms produce and release spores.
 As comyc ota produce spores 
inside enclosed sacs.
 Basidiomycota f
orm and release spores from gills,
 
which are protected by a veil that peels away as the mushroom matures.
 
Mushrooms are a celebration 
- t
hey signal a new generation of  
fungi,
 holding trillions of spores to be released.
 Spores will start the 
cycle again, as the process has gone on for a billion years. 
Nature is not 
sentimental; mushrooms decay the moment their work is done. They 
have served their purpose,
 but not without giving us a glimpse of the 
visceral beauty of nature. M aybe that'

They are the most beautiful moment in the fungal circle of life.

team published studies showing that plants and fungi trade under free 
market principles.

 In some experiments,
 fungi hoarded nutrients in 
their myc elium to decrease the supply
.
 
With increased demand from 
plants,
 fungi inflated the price f
or the same nutrients.
 
T
he team also 
found that some species of plants hijack mycelial networks and steal 
energy f
or survival.
 This is the case for the ghost plant (

), a
 translucent w

to photosynthesise.
 In Kiers'

 capitalist fungi and plants display 
similarities to humans in their ability to manipulate the supply and 
demand of the f

Fungi don't 
possess intelligence in the form of a brain or 
centralised nervous system. They have a series of nerve nets distributed 
throughout the mycelium through which chemicals can travel, 
similar 
to our neural transmitters.
 These chemical signals trigger responses 
that are programmed into their DNA ,
 
an intelligence that,
 in many 
cases,
 rivals the human brain in its degree of intricacy

complexity  
and connections.

a classification is used.
 The basic unit of biological 
classification is the species. The name of a species is a binomial that pairs the 
name of a genus and a species epithet. For the fly agaric,
 
Amanita muscaria
the genus name is 
Amanita
 and the species epithet is 
muscaria
.
Each species is placed in a hierarchy of taxa, from genus through the ranks 
of family
,
 
order
, c
lass, phylum and kingdom.
 
Further ranks can be interpolated,
 
using the prefixes 
'

 and 
superclass sits betwe en class and kingdom. 
A. muscaria

Think of the classification of lif
e as a gigantic library where each book is 
equivalent to a species.
 The library is arranged ov
er separa
te floors (t
he phy
l

)
,
 
and 
on each floor there are separate rooms (t he classes
) and so on,
 until you come to 
individual shelv
es (
the genera),
 
w here the species are lined up
.
 
S
ome shelves ha

many species

some hav

but each species has a place in the ov
erall system.
Biological classification aims to organise life to reflect evolutionar y 
relationships. 
Species within the same genus are more closely related than those 
placed in diff
erent genera.
 L ooking at this a different way
,
 
the common ancestor 
in evolution is more recent for all the species within a genus, 
compared to all the 
species in a family
,
 
and even further back in evolutionar y time for all the species 
within an order
, a
nd so on.
 M
ycologists expect that there are several million 
species of fungi,
 so placing them all within a classification is essential to keep 
track of relationships.

such as the production of  a certain chemical of use in industry or medicine,
 other 
closely related species are a good place to look for subtle variations that might 
have enhanced versions of the property of interest.
When building a classification, 
there are two things happening.
 Firstly
,
 
the 
species need to be discovered,
 delimited and named,
 and secondly
,
 
the species 
must be place d in the overall classification. 
Species delimitation involves carefully 
comparing a novel, 
or new
,
 
species against its closest relatives to determine that  
it is different, and essentially that it represents an independent evolutionar y unit.
The features used f
or delimiting species and placing them in an overall 
classification are similar
,
 
but the tool kit of traits has evolved over time.
 Initially
,
 
visible characteristics of fungi were used that could be readily seen by the 
naked eye, s
uch as shape
,
 
size and colour
.
 From the middle of the 19th centu r y
,
 
microscopic characteristics that are visible under high magnification, such as  
the surface features of spores,
 were integrated.
 From around the beginning of the 
21st century
,
 
DNA sequence information became of prime importance f
or fungal 
classification. 
Other characteristics used include chemical and ecological f
eatures, 
such as whether they are hosts f
or symbiotic organisms.
 Ideally
,
 
information from 
a number of lines of evidence is used.
For DN
A ,
 initially
,
 
small sections were used to reconstruct the tree of 
life.
 Increasingly
,
 
information from across the genome (
the sum total of DN
A
 
in an organism) is analysed.
 DNA i s the blueprint for a species. I
t contains the 
instructions f
or the entire organism.
 While the outward appearance of two 
different fungi might seem similar
, t
he microscopic features,
 such as spores, 
may 
vary considerably
,
 
and features at the cellular level ma
y also be fundamentally 
different. By analysing DNA
 sequences,
 we go straight to the underlying 
instructions
.
 
This is particularly useful because parallel evolution is common 
in fungi,
 meaning that quite unrelate d species may share features.
 For example,
 
fungi with gills (
mushrooms
) have evolved independently in various orders in  
the 
Fungi
 kingdom.
Integration of inf
ormation from DNA
 sequences continues to rewrite the 
classification of fungi at all levels. 
Phyla are proliferating,
 with more than a dozen 
included in some recent classifications, 
and there are constant rearrangements at 
all ranks.
 This rearrangement is both frustrating and exciting! Names continue to 
change, even f
or common and long-known species, b
ut the flip side is that these 
name changes reflect our improved understanding of the tree of life and how the 
features of fungi have evolved.
Many of the estimated several million species of fungi are currently known 
only from small fragments of D
N
A
 that have been recovered from soil or water 
samples. Th
e DNA
 is different enough that it certainly represents novel species,
 
and perhaps even novel phy
l a ,
 but there is no physical specimen.
 The existence of 
these '
dark taxa'
 of fungi,
 named by allusion to the 
'
d
a
rk matt e r '
 of the universe, 
is 
a challenge f
or mycologists,
 because the current rules of naming require a physical 
specimen.
 There is lively debate at the moment about how to deal with naming 
organisms known only from DN
A sequences.
 Whichever solutions emerge, it is 
vital to collect and classify the dark taxa so that they can be effe ctively conserved 
and utilised.
 O ne thing is sure 
-
 
m ycologists will not run out of work for quite  
a while!

Humans
are 
the

animals 
that 
have 
learned 
to 
cook.
 
Cooking 
uses 
chemical 
reactions
to 
transform 
raw
ingredients 
into 
a 
rich 
array 
of 
sensory 
pleasures.
For 
most 
people, 
food
is 
not 
just 
for 
sustenance.
Meals 
form 
the 
fabric 
of 
our 
society
,
 
and 
it 
is 
around 
a 
table 
that 
we 
celebrate 
and 
share 
our 
cultures.
The

of 
a 
steak, 
 
a

these 
are 
all 
achievements 
of 
culture.
The 
study 
of 
food
illuminates 
much 
about 
the 
society 
of 
a 
region,
revealing 
its circumstances, v alues and beliefs.
Fungi 
have 
fed 
us 
from 
the 
dawn 
of 
time 
as 
a 
source
of 
healthy
,
 
nutrient-dense 
food. 
Communities 
around 
the 
world 
have 
long 
foraged 
for 
mushrooms 
to
use 
as 
food 
or 
to 
support 
themselves 
through 
sales 
of 
wild 
harvests. 
More recently
,
 
people have started
cultivating mushrooms 
in 
their 
homes,
using 
organic 
waste 
or
beginner-friendly 
grow kits.
 W

have
become 
more aware 
of 
our 
health 
and 
the 
role 
mushrooms 
can 
play 
in 
boosting 
our 
immune 
system. 
This 
self-sufficiency 
also 
improves 
the 
resilience 
of communities during social and economic crises.
 
Microscopic 
fungi 
are 
also 
hard 
at
work 
making 
our 
food
more 
nutritious 
and 
flavourful.
These 
fungi 
cannot 
be 
seen 
with 
the

the production
and fermentation of some of our favourite 
foods, 
such as cheese, w ine and beer

Around ten thousand years ago, h
unter-gatherers pursued agriculture 
and learned to domesticate grains,
 plants and animals. 
They were 
humanity
'
s earliest farmers. Th e next challenge was foo d preservation: 
how do you preserve harvests to ensure a stable f
oo d supply through 
winters and droughts? Fermentation was the key to tasty and nutritious 
food preservation,
 and the key to fermentation is fungi.
Fermentation is the decomposition of organic matter using 
microorganisms such as yeast, mould or bacteria.
 Essentially
,
 
letting 
food go '
bad'
 i n a controlled way
.
 Many of our favourite fo o d s are 
made from the controlled decay of ingredients using fungi as the lead 
decomp oser
. M
ilk transforms into cheese, yeasted dough rises and 
becomes bread, and grain decomposes into alcohol.
 
As a society
,
 
we 
view death as a tragedy
,
 
yet death is w
hat gives lif
e its richness.
 Fungi 
decay foo d, 
but they also breathe a new life of rich fla
vour into it: 
think kimchi,
 salami and ketchup. Cultures of fungi and bacteria create 
cultures of fo od. Fermentation makes f
o o d more digestible,
 healthy and 
delicious.
 It can even increase the vitamins and minerals in food and 
make them more available for absorption.
Alcohol was one of the very first ferments.
 It uses yeast to  
initiate decomp osition.
 This is a natural process that has been used  
to make alcohol long bef
ore the science behind it was understood.

Considering the euphoric state alcohol 
brings,
 it '
s no surprise the ancient Greeks accredited this miraculous 
transformation to a god: Dionysus,
 the god of f
ertility and wine  
(and by extension,
 f
ermentation
)
.
 
Alongside alcohol, essential nutrients such as vitamins B1,
 B2 
and B3 are produced from this process,
 w
hich benefits energy levels,
 
improves brain function and promotes cell health.

 Similarly

wine was fermented as early as 7400 years ago in 
Persia (
now Iran), f ollowing the domestication of grapes.
3
Alcoholic 
beverages were invented many times and on nearly every continent.
 
How could we not consider fungi nature'

Almost 
every plant with some sugar or starch was used for fermentation into 
alcohol:

 rice, sweet potatoes and

The desire f
or alcohol by early civilisations 
was as universal as fungal spores in the atmosphere.
Since yeasts are microscopic, 
their discovery was not as simple 
as identifying ingredients in a recipe. It wasn't 
until the invention of 
the microscop e in the 19th century that scientists could observe the 
fermentation process and,
 finally
,
 
the microorganisms responsible. 
Before this,
 nobody knew that the alcohol and carbon dioxide produced 
during fermentation was due to a tiny

Moulds also made their mark on the East.

China,

fuzzy colonies in warm,

 Before you recoil in disgust,
 think of miso,
 soy sauce, rice 
wine and rice vinegar:
 all these cornerstone flavour bombs in Asian 
cuisines are fermented using moulds.
L e t '
s take soy sauce as an example -
 no East Asian pantry is 
complete without a bottle of this umami goodness.
 Hailing from 
2 0 0   C E  China ,
 
soy sauce (or 
shoyu
 in Japan
) is produced by mixing 
soybeans,
 w
heat or barley flour as the substrate and inoculating it with 
Aspergillus oryzae
 
(
c
ommonly known as 
koji
 in Japan or 
qu
 in China).
 
As the mould begins to consume the substrate
,
 
salt and water are added 
and the mixture is left to f
erment for six months. The liquid that is 
subsequently pressed out from the substrate is soy sauce.
In traditional soy sauce production, 
large vats are filled with the 
chosen substrate and inoculated with mould. The vats are left out in  
the sun to let nature complete the pro cess 
- h
eat and time allow the 
mould to ferment the substrate. 
One of the amino acids released in  
this process is glutamate.
 When glutamate is combined with sodium,
  
it creates monosodium glutamate (MS G),
 a delicious fla
vour c ompound 
found in most condiments
.
 
MSG imparts an intensely pleasurable and 
salty flavour called umami,
 the fifth taste that stimulates our taste buds 
alongside sweet,
 salty
,
 
sour and bitter
.
 
To da y '
s production of high-
quality soy sauce hasn'
t changed much,
 
except that the sun is swapped 
with a temperature- controlled room.
In the W
est, 
ferments using the 
Aspergillus
 genus are uncommon. 
In the 18th century
,
 
Europeans made soy sauce using portobel lo 
mushrooms (
Agaricus bisporus
) instead,
 due to their natural glutamate 
content and accessibilit y
.
 
A large variety of meats such as salami and 
ham were cured through artisanal methods of salting, drying and 
fermenting using moulds and bacteria.

egulated for time,

and acidity

cured sausages are usually inoculated with

ven chocolate and c offee undergo

The 1920s ushered in a new era of food production after the 
discovery of the mould 
Aspergillus niger
. Th is fungus could create large 
amounts of citric acid through controlled fermentation, 
using different 
types of sugars as the substrate
.
 
Companies use citric acid to extend  
the shelf lif
e of food products and to improve the fla
vour and texture.  
The term '
biotechnolog y
'
 was coined by the agricultural engineer 
Károly Ereky after Pfizer commercialised citric acid for the food, drug 
and chemical industries.

 A c
entury later
,
 
citric acid is still produced 
using 
A. niger
. O
ne humble fungus underpins a multibillion-dollar 
market that flavours and preserves foo ds such as swe ets and soft

 Other fungal fermentations have spawned an extensive list 
of valuable comp ounds for fo od processing,
 such as preservatives,
 
proteins,
 vitamins,
 fats and oils.
Fungi'
s natural capabilit y to secrete enzymes and metabolise  
a diverse range of organic matter drives innovations in biotechnology
.
 
Enzymes speed up chemical reaction, 
which is impor tant in industrial 
production.
 They also allow processes that would otherwise require 
high temp eratures and harsh chemicals to be undertaken in far milder 
and more energy-efficient conditions using enzymes. 
Nearly two-thirds 
of the enzymes used across all industrial manufacturing are derived 
from fungi.
 Considering that there are up to 6 million species of fungi,
 
most of which are undiscovered,
 there may well be methods for making 
industrial processes better for the planet that are just beyond our reach.

Fermentation has come a long way and delivered many surprising 
results.
 O ne of these delightful accidents is tempeh, 
a staple in  
plant-base d diets since its origin in Indonesia in the early 1800s.
Historians believe that the creation of tempeh was accidental.
 It may 
have been discovered w
hile attempting to preserve soybeans from the 
heat overnight.
7
 During this process, 
the soybeans caught the spores 
of a fungus,
 w
hich triggered a f
ermentation process and f
orme d the 
compact cake we now know as tempeh. The fungus responsible is 
Rhizopus oligosporus

or other legumes,

mycelium that is 100 per cent edible and filled with protein,

and vitamins.
David Zilber
, t
he former head of fermentation at the restaurant 
Noma,
 has taken tempeh to a new level. As part of the plant-based 
movement, 
chefs worldwide have tried to replicate the be ef patty in 
burgers using meat alternatives. Z
ilber created a tempeh patty made 
from quinoa.
 The quinoa grains were colonised by m
ycelium and left to 
ferment in the open air to reduce the moisture content, retaining only 
enough to keep the patty juicy when it was cooke d .
 Finally
,
 
the patty 
was seared with a glaze of yeast garum and fava bean shoyu,
 w

What makes tempeh nutritious,
 and why has it become a wonder 
food? Not only does tempeh contain some of the fundamentals of our 
diet - proteins,
 carbohy
drates and fats from the soybeans 
-
 
t
he myc elium 
also offers benefits similar to mushrooms
.
 
It is rich with all nine amino 
acids; packed with fibre,
 vitamins and minerals;
 low in calories; and 
free from cholesterol.
 S o it is not only mushro oms that can be eaten,
 
but mycelium too.
 The best part is that the mycelium of some fungi 
has a texture very similar to meat,
 
which is why it'
s become a popular 
option on the plates of plant-base d eaters.

fungal mycelium branded as 
'mycoprotein'

Its commercial success is 
owed to the fungus 
Fusarium venenatum
, w hich could convert starch 
into high levels of protein quickly
.
 
Their patent for this production 
process lapsed in 2010
, a
llowing other players to enter the mycoprotein 
space. But Quorn continues to be ubiquitous in supermarkets toda

beef and fish.
Ecovative is a biotechnology company founded by Eben Bayer 
and Gavin McIntyre in 2007 that is taking the next logical step and 
harnessing fungi to fabricate mycelium materials f
or packaging,
 textiles 
and meat alternatives.
 
T
heir latest brainchild is 
Atl ast Foo d, 
where they 
manipulate mycelium into synthetic meat.
 R
egulation of temperature, 
airflow
,
 
carbon dioxide supply and humidity encourages the mycelium'
s 
fibrous tissues to grow into the shape of various cuts of meat.
 
This 
complex process is a f
orm of fermentation that allows mycelium to 
develop different textures,
 strengths and fibre compositions,
 resembling 
animal meat within ten days.
The hope is that mycelium-based meat will reduce the burden 
of animal agriculture on the planet.
 
A
t

is made up of a vertical farming infrastructure that requires ten times 
less land and proc esses less carbon dioxide than traditional meat 
production does.

 first product,
 mycelium bacon,
 also  
uses 100 times less water than conventional pork production. 
Advances in biotechnology ha
ve allowed this industry to find 
viable solutions to create sustainable fo od sources f
or the future.
  
Why should we take from nature when we can artificially grow food 
using fewer resources and causing less harm? For everyone who is 
waiting,
 Bayer says global availabilit y is possible within three years.

Macrofungi means 
'
big fungi'
 in Latin.
 The name refers to the sporing 
body of this kind of fungi,
 also known as the mushroom.
 These  
sporing bodies ha
ve evolved to not only be visually unique but also 
nutritious and tasty
.
 
Not long ago,
 the public image of mushro oms 
in W
estern culture was limited to sliced ornaments on piz z a ,
 a sauce 
for a pub steak or a canned soup. Th eir nutritional value was rarely 
understood,
 and they were disregarded as a peripheral member of  
the vegetable groc ery aisle.
 
W
e
 
now know better
. N either a plant nor an animal product,
 
mushrooms are a distinct food kingdom.
 
Every mushroom has a 
different nutritional profile,
 but they are all between 20 and 40 per  
cent protein on a dry weight
basis and filled with nutrients.
The humble 
mushroom is actually an ideal food as it is cholesterol-free, sodium-
free, gluten-free,
 low in fats
,
 
sugars and calories and an excellent 
source of essential vitamins and minerals.
11
 They are also complex 
carbohydrates and rich in dietary fibre, like plants 
- a
 true all-rounder
.
 
Gourmet mushro oms carry more distinct and complex flavours 
than the common button mushroom.
 O nce reserved for restaurant 
chefs, more varieties are increasingly available for the home cook.

the oyster (

It'

truffles (
Tuber magnatum) 
and matsutak

Tricholoma matsutake
) hit 
the shelves,
 
a
s they are yet to be commercially cultivated.
 This is not for 
lack of trying -
 farmers and scientists have attempted this potentially 
lucrative endeavour for decades with little success.
 These mushrooms 
form mycorrhizal relationships with select species of trees,
 so it is 
difficult to replicate their ideal growth environment.

The plant-based food movement is wel l underwa
y
,
 and 
mushrooms ha
ve taken centre stage to replace meat in plant-based 
versions of classic dishes like burgers,
 steaks,
 tacos and dumplings.
 
Mushrooms are made up of thick collections of hyphae;
 the more 
entangled the hyphae,
 the more chewy
,
 
tough and meat y the texture.
Fable, an A
ustralian company
,
 
uses mushrooms as the main 
ingredient of plant-based meat alternatives
.
 
One of their recipes uses 
shiitake and a shortlist of all-natural ingredients to produce what 
resembles pulled pork, 
braised beef and beef brisket 
- a
ll with minimal 
processing.
 They source shiitake from farms that would other wise 
throw away imp erfec t mushrooms that do not meet supermarket 
standards.
 Fable solves two major problems:
 avoidable fo od wastage 
and the excessive processing involved in some vegan alternatives.
  
Their products are available in 
Australian supermarkets and are  
even served in Heston Blumenthal'
s restaurants.

mushrooms provide a hi g h - quality source of protein that is produced 
with fewer inputs and energy than animal protein, while containing 
all nine essential amino acids for complete protein intake. O
yster and 
button mushrooms have the highest levels of protein at about 7 per  
cent RDI per 100 grams.
Mushrooms are in vogue, t
hanks to the growing consciousness 
of consumers seeking healthy meat alternatives that are kinder to the 
planet and the animals we share it with.
 Al l around the world, people 
are more concerned with w
hat we are eating,
 how it is produced and 
marketed. No matter how you look at it, 
the meat industry is resource-
intensive.
 It uses dramatically more water and land than plant fo ods 
and mushroom production do, 
while emitting nearly a fifth of all 
global greenhouse gases 
- m ore than the w
hole transportation industry 
combined.
17
 If and when we do choose to eat meat,
 we should recognise 
the journey it has taken to reach us.
The culture of f

is shifting towards organic food, local farmers'
markets and artisanal food. Businesses around the world are starting to

In the wake of the COV I D -
19 pandemic,
 we unra
velled as two crucial 
building blocks of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
 f
oo d and safet y
,
 
were 
tugged out from beneath us.
 Panic buying set in as fo od anxiety fired  
all survival cylinders in our brains.
 Modern f
ood systems,
 already 
fragile and vulnerable
,
 
cracked open.
 
Thankfully
,
 
our ancestors have been here before. 
Interest in 
foraging peaks in times of hardship,
 w
hich reflects the instinctual f
ear 
that arises about the future.
21
 Consciously or not,
 we cop e with fo od 
anxiety by taking back our independence and channel ling an ancient 
ability to find and prepare our own f
ood .
 
W
e
've seen an increase in 
the number of people finding safety and connection with nature, 
with urban foragers finding a new taste for wild mushrooms.
 It '
s not 
that foraging will become the predominant way to survive, i
t '
s about 
regaining that empowering fe eling of self-sufficiency
.
 
Besides,
 the  
thrill of the hunt is enough f
or anyone to keep coming back.
Foraging is a unique activit y in today
'
s digital world. It reconnects 
us with nature. W
e
 easily forget that our bodies and instincts were 
shaped by generations of f
oragers who lived in harmony with the 
natural world. The mental and spiritual nourishment we gain from 
getting out of our heads and into nature cannot be understated. Forests 
and other natural spaces remind us that there is another universe,
 and 
i t '
s just as impor tant (if not mor
e
)
 than the one governe d by money
,
 
commerce,
 p olitics and media.
It'
s not until you lift the veil and consciously peer in that you 
realise how diverse and widespread mushro oms are.
 A t
rip into the 
forest reconnects you with the broader ec osystem; it reminds you that 
you are a part of the web of life,
 
not outside of it.
 A d ecaying tree trunk 
stops being an eyesore and becomes a place of opportunity: bracket 
fungi -
 wood de comp osers that look like shelves 
- t
hrive there,
 small 
and frequent.
 Among dead lea
ves, 
on fallen trees
,
 
in a field of grass or 
on cow dung -
 mushrooms grow every where.
Foraging is an unlearning of society
.
 
Instead of passively 
absorbing information, 
you actively peer into the f
orest to find fungi.
 
Instead of ex
cess,
 
y
ou tak
e only what you need and leave the rest for 
others.
 Instead of dulled senses,
 you hone the skill of noticing,
 taking  
in the mushroom'
s
 body
,
 
earthy aromas and striking shapes,
 textures,
 
and colours.
 
F oraging awakens the senses and reconnects us to our body
.
 
 
It'
s a moving meditation from which you learn about the natural world, 
feel exhilarated by each encounter and with a bit of luck,
 maybe even 
take home some free, 
delicious and nutritious food. 
Happy hunting.

dlands and grasslands are the two primary environments you'l l 
want to start exploring.
 
Wo o dlands offer fungi organic matter on the 
forest floors to f
east on and trees to form mycorrhizal relationships 
with. Depending on the type of mushro oms you are looking for
,
 oak, 
pine, beech and birch trees are longstanding mycorrhizal partners.  
Find these and you're one step closer
. G
rasslands also have an 
abundance of mushrooms,
 but they generally contain f
ewer 
species than wo odlands,
 due to the decreased diversity of trees and 
environmental conditions.
 If these options are too far
, t
ry foraging  
in your gardens or in local parks 
- m ushrooms grow there too.
Australia is a fungal haven. Its history of isolation from other 
continents and its ever - c hanging climate and nutrient- dense forests all 
add to its megadiversity

If you're in New South W

head to Oberon.
 
Y
o
u ' l l find over 40
,00 0 hectares of pine forests,
 making it one of the 
best mushroom-hunting grounds in the country
.
 
Here, you'll be able 
to find the popular edible mushroom saffron milk cap, a
lso known 
as red pine (
Lactarius deliciosus
)
.
 
T
his fungus is said to ha
ve landed 
in A
ustralia by accident, its mycelium attached to the roots of a tree 
imported from Europe. This carrot-orange mushroom was named 
Lactarius deliciosus
 in 1821 by English myc ologist Samuel Frederick 
Gray
,
 
and rightly so,
 as 
Deliciosus
 means 't a s t y '
 in Latin.
 If you want 
to find these mushrooms in Oberon, 
try planning a visit in autumn,
 
between late February to May
,
 
when they proliferate.

 Certain species

When myc elium absorbs water from its surroundings,

 This is why

guides and identification charts,
 c omplete with clear
, d
etailed images.
The purpose of this book is not to teach you how to identify 
mushrooms.
 There are experts who write field guides for that.
 And 
though there is no ' right'
 way to learn,
 using a field guide will help you 
familiarise yourself with some of the species available in your are a ,
 so 
that you have a mental image of what you are hunting for
.
There is a saying among f
oragers: 
'
A
ll mushrooms are edible, b
ut 
some only once.
'
 
Once you've found a mushroom,
 
i t '
s good practice to 
identify it before harvesting. Th is will ensure you only handle safe,
 
edible species rather than unnecessarily displacing mushrooms that 
you can'
t use. Though toxic to humans,
 p oisonous mushrooms have the 
same right to exist as any other living organism. They pla
y their part in 
the wider ecosystem by partnering with trees and providing a source of 
food to other wildlif
e
.
 
When you come across a mushroom,
 consult your guide or even 
take it home to complete further identification analysis by making 
spore prints or studying the features under a microscope. Keep 
repeating this process and the beauty of repetition will help you 
become an expert.
Do not consume any mushroom unless you are completely c ertain 
about its identity
.

symptoms,
 and even death. There are many doppelgangers 
- m any 
poisoning cases come from foragers who hunt in new areas and eat 
mushroom spe cies that they think are saf
e be cause they look similar  
to varieties they are familiar with in their local area.
 
T
o
 
make matters more confusing,
 mushrooms are sometimes both 
edible and poisonous,
 depending on how they are treated.
 O ne example 
is the fly agaric (
Amanita muscaria
), w hich c ontains toxins such as 
ibotenic acid and muscimol.
 When consumed,
 it can cause nau s e a ,
 
dizziness and hallucinations. 
German naturalist Ge org von Langsdorf f  
published methods of detoxifying the mushroom by boiling it,
 w
hich 
makes the sporing body edible.
 P ut simply: do your research.
Once you've cor rectly identified your mushrooms
,
 
consume 
them when they are still fresh 
-  t ypically within a we ek. 
Generally
,
 
mushrooms should be cooke d .

give back.
Obviously
,
 
leaving litter or organic waste that does not originate 
from that environment should alwa
ys be avoided. But to ensure 
mushrooms grow season after season,
 it is also imp ortant to minimise 
soil disturbance and increase the dispersion of spores
.
 
How to achieve 
this and how to sustainably harvest mushrooms has caused some debate 
between f
oragers. 
One method is to cut the sporing body off from the bottom of  
the stipe,
 w
here the mushroom meets the soil or the base of whatever  
it is growing from.
 Cutting avoids damaging the mycelium,
 but it leaves 
a stump that may rot and infe ct the area.
 The alternative method is to 
twist and pick the sporing body from the mycelium, which stops the 
stump from forming. 
A study in Switzerland revealed that 
' long-term and systematic 
harvesting reduces neither the future yields of fruit bodies nor the 
species richness of wild forest fungi,
 irrespective of whether the 
harvesting technique was picking or cutting'
.
22
 The study added that 
trampling on the f
orest floor
, h
owever
,
 does reduce sporing body 
numbers,
 as this could damage the myc elium.
 It '
s impor tant to avoid 
digging out the mushroom,
 as this may have the same damaging effe ct. 
Finally
,
 
cover the harvested area with organic matter to protect the 
mycelium network from drying out.
Harvesting etiquette also includes leaving some behind. Don't  pick 
all the mushrooms in an area,
 unless it'
s a common species.
 Whenever 
there are two mushrooms together
,
 
p
ick one and leave the other
.
 
W
hen  
a mushroom is mature,
 it loses its fla
vour and texture -
 leave these 
behind so they can continue to release their spores. Another way to 
make sure your harvested mushrooms can spread their spores across  
the forest floor is to use a wick
er bask
et or mesh bag.
There are laws prohibiting f
oraging in public areas and state 
forests
,
 
so research bef
ore you go to avoid penalties. S
ome areas ma
y 
require a permit or have limits on how much you can collect, and other 
areas forbid harvesting completely on conservation grounds.
Like anything worthw
hile,
 f
oraging is a process of learning,
 
trying,
 recalibrating and trying again.
 Everything requires time and 
commitment but the exhilaration of connecting with the kingdom  
of fungi is like nothing else.

Finding fungi requires slowness,
 not speed.
 It '
s about careful observation, 
noticing subtle differences.
 Finding fungi as fo od is about learning a few 
species thoroughly
,
 
rather than many superficially
.
 
This is the notion of slow 
mushrooming. L
ike slow fo od or slow art,
 it '
s about care, a ttention to detail and 
developing deep know

It'

research.
 It '
s about being a
ware of how our choices and actions aff

around us.
Fungi are diverse and ubiquitous.
 There are few places you won't  find them.
 
Some are delicious and others are deadly

With interest in foraging f
or wild food 
on the rise,
 learning to accurately identify fungi through slow mushrooming 
reduces the risk of harming yourself and the environment.

What is an edible mushroom

encompassing 
everything from

S
ome species are poisonous but

Notice
y
o ur surrounds
Slow mushrooming begins with understanding the ec ological significance  
of fungi in the context of their environments.
 Fungi are not isolated entities.
  
They live in close association with other organisms and their habitats. Accurately 
identifying a mushroom means being able to recognise,
 f
or example,
 the habitat 
types or plants with which a particular fungus associates.
Many fungi f
orm symbioses (
alliances) with other organisms.
 Those that 
form between fungi and plants are known as mycorrhizal symbioses.
 R
ecog nising 
these relationships has obvious benefits for the forager
. B
eing able to identify the 
tree genera with which a particular fungus is associated sa
ves the forager from 
aimless wandering around in the 
' wrong'
 habitat.
Finding fungi also means being able to anticipate the type of substrate 
(growing medium) in which a particular species grows. S

by eliminating all those substrate types where it doesn't 
grow
.
Keep in mind that seeing a particular fungus species once doesn't
 mean 
you'll be able to recognise it the next time you encounter it.
 
Identification skills 
develop from direct experience in the field and observing a species in different 
places and conditions over time,
 as well as learning to recognise its important 
diagnostic features.
 O bserving the same species in different habitats and 
situations allows you to b ecome familiar with the extent of variation that can 
occur within that species.
 
A
s
 a mushroom develops
,
 
it can change in shape,
 f
orm 
and colour
.
 
T
his is further influenced by where and in what it is growing,
 as well 
as its exposure to different weather conditions.
Colour a
nd f
o
rm
Homo sapiens
 have evolved to notice colour
.
 
It'
s usually the first thing we notice 
and comment on when we spot a mushroom.
 Colour is important for identifying 
fungi,
 but it can also be an unreliable feature because it can vary greatly within 
a species.
 Colour can change as a natural part of the developmental process or 
with exposure to wind,
 sun or rain.
 Many fungi share similar colours but flipping 
through a field guide looking for a mushroom of a similar colour will only get 
you so far
. I
t is important to consider colour and morphology (
shape, form,
 
texture and general appearance
) in tandem.
Becoming familiar with the different parts of a mushroom (f
or example,
  
the pileus,
 lamellae and stip e
)
 and the variations both within and between species 
is the starting point to finding your way around a mushroom. A small hand lens 
(x
 
10 magnification)  will help you observe the finer features.
 D on'
t
 forget to also 
use your sense of touch.
 
Mushrooms vary enor mously in texture,
 and touch 
reveals details that are not always apparent to the naked eye. U se your fingers to 
discover whether
, f or example,
 a specimen is smooth,
 velvety
,
 
rubbery or buttery
.
These are just a few hints to get you started. Y
o
u could spend a whole 
day
,
 
week or month f
eeling mushrooms to become familiar with their diff
erent 
textures.
 
Y
ou could smel l them all to familiarise your nose with the great arra
y 
of fungus scents and odours. Or you might simply begin by getting to know your 
local plant species and the fungi that associate with them. 
All these things take 
time, a n d  g r a d u a l l y  your accumulated observation develops into knowledge.
  
The good news,
 it seems,
 is that slow mushrooming is growing fast.

The easiest preservation method is to clean and transfer them into a 
freezer-safe container
.
 
K eep in mind that freezing mushrooms tends 
to compromise the texture ,
 
s
o it'
s best to use the tha
wed mushrooms in 
soup stocks or chopped into veggie burgers, 
as opposed to frying them.
Another great way to preserve mushrooms is to dry them,
 w
hich 
allows them to be kept for years in airtight jars.
 Many people stick to 
the classic method of drying,
 w
hich is to put the mushrooms out in the 
sun for one to two w
eeks.

Mushroom cultivation  can be traced back to the 13th century
,
 
when 
the first written records of shiitake  cultivation were detailed in China
'
s
 
Sung Dynasty
.
23
 Shiitake 
(Lentinula edodes)
 is a saprophyt ic fungus  
that decomposes wood.
 Early cultivators chopped down hardwood  
logs to use as the substrate.
 They drilled holes on the log surface  
5 to 10 centimetres apart,
 
then filled the holes with shiitake m
ycelium 
spawn,
 w
hich is a starter culture of my
celium growing on a substra
t
e
.
 
The spawn was cov
ered with wax to protect it from the weather
,
 
a
nd the 
logs were stacked up
.
 
T
he myc elium decom
posed the w
ood ov
er eight 
to fo urteen months until it reached the ends of the logs.
 This signified 
a successfully colonised log that was ready to gro
w mushroom
s
.
 
If it 
rained,
 the logs would grow mushrooms shortly after
,
 otherwise the logs 
are soaked in water for 
twenty-four 
hours to stimulate the gro
wth.
 Af ter 
a day or two
,
 
t
iny mushrooms called pinheads would appear
.
 
I
t only took 
a few more days for
 the pinheads to morph into full shiitake mushrooms, 
which w
ere then harv
ested.
 Shiitake  continues to be cultivated this way 
by artisans in Japan and China.
T
o
d
a
y
,
 
cultivation of most mushroom species has moved indoors,
 
and transitioned from using natural substrates such a s wood to 
agricultural by-products such as cor n cobs and peanut hulls. This type 
of organic matter was previously classified as waste by the agricultural 
industry
,
 
but to mycelium it is a nutritious food source.
 The move 
indoors has allowe d cultivators to control environmental conditions 
to make energy
,
 
water and land use more efficient. This process is 
therefore more environmentally friendly and provides a steadier yield 
and lower prices for consumers compared with outdoor cultivation.
The increase in the global availability of cultivated mushrooms 
has been reflected in sup ermarket produce aisles.

Another reason w
hy 
A. bisporus

today is because it fee ds on a range of organic matter

T
his is not the 
case for wild fungi such as chanterelles,
 morels and truffles, 
as their 
food source is from myc orrhizal relationships.
 They live in association 
with the roots of plants
,
 
so replicating their natural habitat in an 
industrial setting is more complex. 
Mushrooms have only come into the spotlight in recent times
,
 
so 
we are still in the early stages of understanding how to cultivate other 
fungal species.

 about twenty mushroom species are cultivated ,

This brilliant and intensely yellow mushroom is a delight to spot 
among leaf litter
. I
ts abundance makes it one of the most wel l-known 
mushrooms in the world. It is so plentiful that companies harvest it 
commercially for  expor t. 
Cibarius
 means '
goo d to eat'
,
 
and with an 
annual global market valued at US$1.4 billion,
 
it sure is.

Lactarius deliciosus
 is a carrot-orange hued mushroom with an elegant  
v a s e - shaped sporing body
.
 
The body is connected to a short stem that  
is distinctively pitted ,
 
as if pressed with oval stamps. When a piece of 
the cap or gill is broken off
, d
roplets of saffron- orange milk ooze out.
 
The damaged area then quickly oxidises and turns pistach i o - green.

Spring.
For mushroom foragers,
 spring is marked by the appearance of 
Morchella esculenta
. I
t has ridges and pits on its honeycom b -textured 
body
,
 
which is usually taller than the stipe.
 It ranges from brownish-
black to yellow and cream,
 but its distinguishing feature is that it is 
completely hollow
.
 It is a highly sought-after gourmet mushroom,
 
but attempts at cultivation have been unsuccessful due to its close 
relationship with the roots of certain trees.

O ur

A 
natural 
intelligence propels them forward,
 
day in and day out, for 
decades,
with 
one 
singular 
purpose:
to 
keep 
us 
alive.
O ur

Hundreds

When something ev

It

But the declin e in health and wellbeing
in modern society
is the result of a combination of physical,

Modern medicine alone cannot fi

Increasingly
,
 
people 
are

There is a long history of  using fungi for their medicinal qualities.
 
Mushrooms have a starring role in traditional cultures due to their dual 
role as fo od and medicine.
 The wisdom of this duality is highlighted 
in an ancient Chinese proverb,
 
yao shi tong 
uan
, which translates to 
'medicine and food share a common origin'
.
 
After all, 
what we consume 
every da
y provides the building blocks for our bodies to make and 
replace cells, 
and is the source of nutrition for a healthy metabolism 
and strong immune system.
Traditional Chinese medicine is,
 in fact,
 a useful lens through 
which to consider the potential role of fungi in our lives
,
 
as it views the 
body as a whole system that seeks balance and connection with nature.
 
Qi is the life force or energy flow
,
 
and good health reflects a state where 
qi is circulating the body in equilibrium. Illness and its symptoms 
reflect an imbalance of energy
.
 
Herbal tonics contain medicinal 
compounds that are believed to replenish qi and bring the body back 
i n t o  b a l a n c e .
 T h i s  h o l i s t i c  t r e a t m e n t  e xp l i c i t l y  a cknowl e d g e s  t h e   
role of nutrition,
 exercise and mental health in promoting th e  b o d y '
s 
innate self-healing potential.
Over and ab ove the nutritional value of mushrooms,
 the 
medicinal values long ascribed to them are now being validated using 
modern scientific methods.
 Microscopic fungi, such as yeasts and 
moulds,
 play a big part too
.
 
But we ha
ve only just started peering into 
the fungal medicine cabinet to harness their properties to treat human 
diseases and infections.
 In the rush to create new medicines,
 it '
s worth 
understanding what ancient cultures have used to great effect for 
thousands of years.

 For Ö tzi,
 
medicine existed in the form of two mushrooms, 
which he kept in his 
belt pouch.
 
One was a birch polypore (
Fomitopsis betulina
) with broad 
antibiotic and anti-parasitic properties. 
Scans of his body revealed that 
Ötzi had whipworm.
 
He presumably used the birch polypore to expel 
parasites from his digestive tract.
 Ö tzi also carried a tinder fungus 
(
Fomes f
omentarius
), w hich is highly flammable when struck with flint 
stones.
 He probably used this f
or starting fires and sterilising wounds.
Hippocrates, 
widely regarded as the father of modern 
medicine,
 also prescribed tinder fungus to cauterise wounds and 
treat inflammation in 4 5 0   B C E. Alongside Hippocrates,
 some of the 
earliest know
ledge resides within the pages of the first Chinese materia 
medica,
 
Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing
 (
T h e  Divine Farmer's
 Materia Medica
compiled around 250 BC E. It prescribed fourteen medicinal fungi in its 
list of 365 herbal medicines and formed the f
oundation f
or traditional 
Chinese medicine.

pharmaceutical companies extract the active compounds from these 
ancient remedies and millions of patients with life -threatening 
diseases,
 from diabetes to cancer
, a
re treated each year with medicines 
made from microfungi. This contemporary use began with the 
discovery of penicillin by 
Alexander Fleming.
By the end of the 1800s,
 scientists understood that bacteria 
caused many diseases,
 and research f
ocuse d on wa
ys to impede bacterial 
growth.
 In those times,
 even a minor cut could lead to tissue damage, 
organ failure and death. 
In 1928,
 F leming was studying the bacteria 
Staphylococcus
 at St Mary
'
s Hospital in London, 
when spores of the 
mould 
Penicillium
notatum
 drifted into the lab and landed in a petri 
dish. Several strokes of good fate facilitated the discovery of  penicillin.
 
Fleming was on a two-week vacation when the contamination 
occurred,
 he had not packed away his experiments before his departure, 
and the temperature was warm enough in London to permit the 
growth of both the bacteria and mould.
 By the time Fleming returned,
 
he observed that there was a bacteria-free zone around the mould.
 
The mould had not only inhibited the growth of the bacteria,
 but also 
produced chemicals that killed the bacteria completely
.
 
Fleming named 
the active chemical 
'p enicillin'
 and published his findings in the 
Journal of Experimental Patholog

. D
espite its promise, 
penicillin was 
difficult to purify and stabilise f
or clinical trials.
A decade later
, D
r Howard Florey and Dr Ernst Chain from 
Oxford University stumbled upon Fle m i n g '
s  paper
.
 
W
hile Fleming is 
frequently attributed as the sole f
ounder of penicillin,
 it was Florey and 
Chain and their colleagues who prove d, 
through a series of gruel ling 
experiments,
 
t
hat penicillin was non-to
xic to humans and effective f
or 
treating a wide range of inf
ections in the human body
.
 
By 1941,
 in the 
midst of W
orld W
ar I I ,
 they knew that 
P
.
 
n
otatum
 could never yield 
enough penicillin to treat people reliably
.
 
The search began for high-
yielding strains of 
Penicillium
.
Fruit and soil samples were submitted from all over the world. 
In 1943,
 a laboratory assistant named Mary H
unt sent in a cantaloupe 
covered in a 'pretty
,
 
golden mould'
.
5
 That mould was 
Penicillium 
chrysogenum
 and it yielde d a tremendous amount of penicillin 
-  
1000 times as much as 
P
.
 
n
otatum
 after a few rounds of mutations.  
The team developed the production process and companies in the  
US and UK quickly mass-produced penicillin,
 enabling the first 
antibiotics to be sold as drugs.
 
Penicillin was a wonder drug. I
t cured disease and infections  
on the front line for the rest of the war
. S
ome historians even credited 
the Allied victory to the miracle of penicillin.

 As
 a relatively accessible natural remedy

with few side effects 
and no known lethal dose,
 medicinal mushrooms in particular are an

 Beyond 
that, fungi permeate the market in the form of powders, capsules,
 
tinctures,
 drinks and even skincare.

Of all the wonderful services that the body provides,
 the immune 
system is one of the most remarkable. It is our natural def
ence system.
 
It protects us for most of our lives, d
espite our limited understanding 
of how it works. 
The immune system acts like border control, identifying and 
removing any incoming threats. I
t has physical barriers 
- t
he skin is the 
most impor tant of these, a
long with hair
, m ucus and tears.
 The second 
line of defence is chemical.
 Antimicrobial barriers are secreted on the 
skin, in vaginal discharge and in semen.
 O ur stomach also contains 
strong acids and large populations of good bacteria that prevent 
harmful bacteria from colonising the body
.
 
If pathogens manage to get past these defe nces,
 the immune 
system dispatches immune cells from the lymph nod
e
s
,
 
thymus,
 spleen,
 
bone marro
w
,
 
tonsils and other parts of the body
.
 
There are a variety 
of immune cell
s
,
 
but their uniting purpose is to fight off disease and 
infections.
 I
t is critical that they can tell the diffe rence between healthy 
and dangerous cells. 
Most symptoms of illness don'

actually originate 
from microbes but from the activities of our immune system.

Fungi are constantly engaged in comp etition with microbes,
 insects 
and other animals.
 Fungi are immobile, 
so they cannot run a
way in the 
face of a threat. 
Their method of self-defence is to produce an array 
of complex chemicals that attack and destroy pathogens. Fortunately
,
 
fungi have had millions of years to develop their arsenal of chemical 
survival strategies.
 And fortunately for us,
 many of these strategies can 
be helpful in our fight f
or health. Many of the compounds that fungi 
use to fight off pathogens are also effe ctive in our bodies.
 Perhaps this 
is because of our evolutionary closeness (
we share almost 50 per cent 
of our DNA
 and 85 per cent of our RNA
 with fungi),
8
 or perhaps it'
s 
simply our long history of c o - e volution. 
Medicinal fungi are not just antibiotics.
 The potential f
or 
various fungi to produce medically useful molecules has expanded 
beyond antibacterial and into antifungal,
 anti-parasitic and antiviral

Although medicinal mushrooms have been used in traditional 
medicine for thousands of years, i
dentifying beneficial comp ounds 
and extracting the active ingredient f
or mass production is a mark
er of 
modern medicine.
 Compounds found in sporing bodies and mycelium 
can regulate the immune system,
 stimulating the body

nucleosides.
 The two most studied compounds are beta-glucans  
and triterpenes.
Beta
-
glucans
Fungal cell walls are made up of chitin, the same structural component 
that is f
ound in the exoskeletons of crustaceans.
 Fungal cell walls are 
rigid,
 and nested inside them are long chains of complex carbohydrates 
called polysaccharides. F ungi contain many types of beneficial 
polysaccharides,
 but the most important one for humans is a  
beta-glucan (specifically
,
 
the (1-3)(1-6) beta-D
- glucan).
 
Over 20
,00 0 published studies have shown beta-glucans to 
be the most potent natural immune system-supporting forces ever 
discovered. They can stimulate weak immune systems and regulate 
overactive ones. 
They increase our protection against bacterial,
 
viral and parasitic inf
ections,
 and offer a host of other synergistic 
health benefits.
 N
ot surprisingly
,
 
the species of fungi most revered in 
traditional medicine are high in beta-glucans.
 Studies that tested for 
the level of beta-glucans in mushrooms found the highest beta-glucan 
content in the sporing bodies of turkey tail (
T
r
a
metes versicolor
) and 
reishi (
Ganoderma lingzhi
).
O u r  c o - evolution with fungi has left our bodies with rec eptor 
sites that can receive compounds found in fungi.
 As  we evolved,
 we 
capitalised on the fact that fungi,
 microbes,
 plants and animals have 
different processes to produce molecules.
 
W
e
 develop ed pattern 
recognition receptors that specifically bind to non-human comp ounds.
 
Picture a lock and key:
 when we consume beta-glucans,
 they fit 
into specific receptor sites in our immune system and activate our 
immune cells.
 Immune cells hunt for pathogens and cancerous cells 
in the body
.
 
By stimulating your immune cells,
 you stimulate your 
b o d y '
s innate healing and defence responses. Th is means that medicinal 
mushrooms support nearly all of the body
'
s major systems and allow 
you to perfor m at your full potential.
9
Beta-glucans are found in all fungi,
 including microscopic yeasts.
 
With more than eight y clinical trials evaluating their biological effects,
 
the question is not 
if 
beta-glucans will move
from supplement to widely 
accepted drug,
 
but 
when
.
Triterpen
e
s
Unlike beta-glucans,
 w
hich exist in all fungi,
 terpenes are only found  
in select species.
 
Ter penes have been studied for their anti-cancer
,
 
 
anti-tumour
, a
ntimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties and  
their effe ctiveness in countering neurodegenerative diseases. Th ey 
work by stimulating our immune cells to attack pathogens that invade

Science accepts that the brain reorganises itself and creates new 
brain cells as we grow and age.
 Through a process called neurogenesis,
 
new neurons develop in our hippocampus,
 the part of the brain 
responsible for long-term memory
,
 
learning,
 and emotional stability
.
 
Neurogenesis is regulated by a group of molecules col lectively known 
as the nerve growth factor
. S
tudies suggest that deficiency of the nerve 
growth factor is linked to 
Alzheim e r '
s disease.
The white pom pom-shaped mushroom 
Hericium erinaceus
,
 o
r
lion'
s mane, has captured the attention of scientists due to the discovery 
of two compounds. O
ne comp ound, hericenones,
 was isolated from the 
sporing body
,
 
and another
, e
rinacines,
 was isolated from the mycelium. 
In a trial,
 doses of erinacines were f
ed to rats through their stomach,
 
which prompted the growth of the nerve growth factor and increased 
neurotransmitter levels in their brains.
 
When administered orally in humans,
 these comp ounds can easily 
pass through the blood-brain barrier
, s
uggesting the activation of nerve 
growth factor synthesis. 
This is an exciting discove r y

A group of mildly cognitively-impaired men and women aged betw

fifty and eighty were giv
en 1 gram of dried sporing-body powder 
orally three times a day for
 sixteen weeks.
 
W

significant improvements to cognitiv

12
 These results w

consistent throughout the study
,
 
with findings showing that 
H

potentially regenerates neural networks in the brain.
Other research
substantiates the abilit y of 
H.erinaceus
to promote 
the nerve growth factor
,
 
but it is unclear if the results arise from 
hericenones.
13
 As yet unidentified compounds within the 
H.erinaceus
sporing body could be responsible for these positive effects.
 
Research also shows that a strong immune system can positively 
impact the brain. When the immune system responds to inf
ections or 
an injury
,
 
it triggers inflammation,
 
which is a signal to def
end,
 repair 
and heal the body
.
 
A 2019 study showed that systemic inflammation led 
to a cognitive decline in later adulthood.
 As  a healthy body supports a 
healthy brain,
 
fungi containing beta-glucans with immunomodulatory 
effects may also benefit the brain and cognition.

In the 1960s,
 a beta-glucan called 
polysaccharide krestin ( P S K )  was isolated from the mycelium of 
T
.
 
versicolor 
by Japanese scientists.
 H
uman clinical trials began in 
the 1970s,
 using PS K as a supp orting medicine to create a stronger 
immune response for  people undergoing surgery
,
 
radiation therapy 
and chemotherapy
.
 The study found that 
' P SK significantly ex
tended 
survival at five years or beyond in cancers of the stomach, colon-rectum, 
esophagus
,
 
nasopharynx,
 and lung (non-small cell types
)
,
 
a

of breast cancer s '
.

 In 1977
,
 
PSK was approved as a prescription drug 
by the Japanese Ministry of Medicine for this use.
 
T

In the 1980s,
 Chinese scientists isolated a similar comp ound 
called polysaccharide peptide (P SP) from 
T

versicolor
. I
n double-blind 
trials,
 P SP significantly extended five-year survival rates in esophageal 
cancer patients. 
It improved quality of lif

provided substantial pain 
relief and enhance d immune status in 70 to 97
 per cent of patients  
with cancers of the stomach,
 esophagus

lung, ovary and cervix.

In addition to boosting immune cel l production, 
P S K  a nd  P S P  
also help relieve the side effe cts of conventional cancer treatments,
  
such as nausea and fatigue from chemotherapy
.
 
Both PS P and PS K  
are well-tolerated and patients repor ted little to no side eff

While fungi are not used in first-line cancer treatment therapies, 
they are powerful allies when used as part of a holistic health program.

Medicinal mushroom products have
 flooded the wellness and

food stores.
 Many of them use impressive marketing language on 
their packaging,
 but not all products are crea

.
 
Cultivation 
methods,
 the part of the fungus that is used,
 growing mediums and 
extrac tion processes all affect the quality

 Medicinal compounds such as beta-glucans are bound

 This is why medicinal mushrooms are traditionally

There is much debate about which part of the fungus is best used  
in supplements: the mycelium or the sporing body
.
 
However
,
 this is 
not the right question to ask. A more important question is how much 
of the active comp ounds,
 such as beta-glucans,
 are bioavailable in a 
supplement.
 The form of the mushroom supplement is not important 
-
 
the marker of quality is the bioavailability of the medicinal compounds.
Mycelium contains beneficial compounds that are no better or 
worse than those found in sporing bodies.
 Studies show that beta-
glucans can be f
ound in both the sporing body and mycelium,
 but the 
concentration can be higher in sporing bodies.
 The same research 
found that many mycelium supplements on the market are grown on 
brown rice grain,
22
 which often ends up proc essed with the mycelium 
to create the final product,
 lowering the proportion that is actual fungi.
 
Unfortunately
,
 
many products advertised as medicinal mushro oms are 
filled with starch from grains, which lowers their medicinal potency
.
 
When purchasing products,
 look at the percentage of beta-glucans on 
the label.
 Unfortunately
,
 
very f
ew companies provide this.
 
Finally
,
 
i t '
s impor tant to note that when researching and buying 
mushroom supplements, i
t '
s common to see references to the 
'fr
uiting 
b o d y '
.
 
Fruiting body and sporing body are just different names for 
the same thing,
 b oth refer to the mushroom part of a fungus. Wh ile 
fruiting body is still widely used,
 particularly in the wellness and 
wellb eing industry
,
 
sporing body is generally considered the preferred 
term in mycology

hence our pref

The market fo r medicinal mushroom supplements has experienced explosive 
growth,
 but there are f
ew quality control standards in place.
 Supplements may 
be expensiv
e
,
 
but they generally do not contain the same amounts of beneficial 
compounds as the substances used in human clinical studies.
 These starter  
points may help you evaluate mushroom sup
plements befor
e purchase.
Sourcin
g
It is important to know w
hether the product you are purchasing is made from 
pure fungi.
 Most mushroom supplements are produced in China,
 as it produces 
85 per cent of the world'
s mushrooms and has a long history using medicinal 
mushrooms.
 But not all mushrooms are grown to a high-qualit y standard,
 
whether th e y '
re g rown in 
Asia,
 the Americas or Europe
,
 
so some research  
is necessary
.

High-quality mushrooms are grown on a wood medium,
 w
hich is important 
for p roducing the desired medicinal com
pounds.
 M
ycel ium grown in liquid and 
harvested can provide similar medicinal benefits.
 But you must be careful about 
products that  grow myceli um on grains.
 G rains contain lots of starch ,
 
and 
once a grain is colonised it can be very difficult to separate the mycelium from 
the substrate
,
 
so the two are often processed together
.
 
T
his means that large 
quantities of starch can end up as filler in your mushroom supplements,  
reducing the medicinal value of the product.
Many US companies are producing m
ycelium on sterile grains and calling 
th e ir  pr od u cts  
' mushroom'
.
 
L o o k  ve r y  c a refully at  the label to  s e e  i f  i t  s ays 
myceliated rice or oats
 
- this is my
celium grown on grains,
 w
hich is not what you 
want. For b est results,
 look for pure mycelium or mushroom extracts.

find out if your products contain grains with the iodine test described below
.
Extrac

o
d
If you can, take the time to find out how the nutrients were extracted for each 
product. Most mushroom supplements are hot water extracts,
 as this is sufficient 
to concentrate the important beta-glucans.
 This is known as single extraction.
 
But mushrooms high in triterpenes,
 such as reishi (
Ganoderma lingzhi
) and chaga 
(

All mushroom s have polysaccharides in them,
 a nd the important ones are  
called beta-glucans.
 Look f
or the actual amounts of beta-glucans on the product 
labels.
 Beware: a high percentage of polysaccharides on a product label isn'
t 
correlated with a high percentage of beta-glucans.
 Products are often mixed  
with polysaccharide carriers,
 w
hich can be used as stabilisers
,
 
but these are  
alpha-glucans and starch.
 Polysaccharides are not a valid qualit y assurance 
measure. 
All high-quality products should clearly state the percentage of 
beta-glucans 
-  20 per cent is a good benchmark.

Quality 
control is still in its early days

Some companies test their products using the 
internationally rec ognised Megazyme test, which tests for levels of beta-glucans 
and starch.
 Before purchasing any product, find out if test reports are available. 
If you want to take testing into your own hands, 
an iodine test is an easy 
way to confirm if your powder c ontains starch. 
Stir in 2 to 3 grams or
six capsules
of the powder into 

 cup of water and mix it well for a minute or two. S
tir in ten 
drops of a standard iodine solution.
 A p ure mushroom supplement should only 
change to the colour of the iodine.
 If the liquid turns black or blue,
 this signifies  
a high starch content.

Like all polypor

it lacks 
gills on the underside, and instead releases its spores via fine pores. 
Ganoderma lingzhi
 is rare and hard to find,
 so wild harvests are sold 
for more than US$500 per kilogram.

cultivation on hardwood logs and sawdust,
 it is accessible to anyone

G. lingzhi
 has inspired oriental art,
 
medicine,
 spirituality and myths 
for at least 2500 years.
 It was called the 'mushroom of immorta l i t y '
,
 
as it was believed that it could strengthen the heart,
 calm the spirit 
and replenish the energy of the body
,
 
mind and spirit.
 
G. lingzhi
identified as 
G. lucidum 
by W
estern mycologists until DN
A analysis 
showed that the latter is a European species that doesn'
t grow in 
Asia.
 
The difference is slight - the core la
yer beneath 
G. lingzhi
while 
G. lucidum
 is white. 
Both are equally medicinal.

Ophiocor

 It evolved to feed on live insects,
 
consuming their internal organs then taking over their bodies.
 
Ophiocor
dycep s sinensis
 has a particular taste for ghost moth caterpillars.
 
In China,
 it is called 
' winter worm, summer grass'
 because spores 
germinate in winter and mycelium grows throughout the caterpillar
'
s 
body
.
 
When summer comes,
 a club- shaped sporing body bursts out of  
the caterpillar'
s head and protrudes from the ground so that foragers  
can locate it.

O. s inensis
 has a rich medicinal history in

 Growing demand and 
shrinking supply makes it the world'
s most expensive parasite -
 it is 
worth more than gold. 
Families in and near the Himalayan mountain 
ranges uproot their lives in May and June to f
orage for it.
 They craw
l 
on their elbows and knees,
 inch by inch across the plateau,
 to locate 
the club- shaped sporing body
.
 
Harvesting 
O. s inensis
 is an important 
livelihood  for  h u n d r e d s  o f  t ho u s a n d s  o f  p e ople. Two months of 
work can pay the family'
s living expenses for the rest of the year
.
 
Unfortunately

excessive harvesting and a warming climate are aff

the delicate ecosystem,
 and yet there is no conservation p olicy in place.

There 
are 
profound 
questions 
about 
our 
existence 
that 
govern 
our 
lives, 
whether 
we 
ask 
them 
or 
not.
Around 
14 billion years ago,
stars turned supernova and showered 
the 
universe 
with 
the 
building
blocks 
from 
which 
we 
are 
made.
2
W
e
not 
only 
triumphed 
over 
improbable 
odds 
to 
be 
alive,
we 
received 
the 
spark 
of 
consciousness.
 
W
e 
are 
97 per cent stardust and we are aware of our existence.
3
Only 
through 
consciousness 
does 
our 
world 
come 
alive,
as 
a 
series 
of 
fleeting 
images 
changing 
moment 
by 
moment.
O ur 
brain,
with 
its 
billions 
of 
neurons,
fills 
in 
the 
gaps 
between 
those 
snapshots.
What 
we 
call 
everyday 
reality 
is 
a 
projection
of 
stories 
in 
the 
theatre 
of 
our 
minds.
W
e
live 
with 
world
views 
that
we 
are 
unaware 
of, 
hypnotised 
by 
the 
assembling 
stories 
that 
have 
been 
handed to us.
S o who are we,
beneath the layers of cultural 
and 
social 
conditioning? 
What
is 
our 
purpose? 
Anyone
interested in unravelling the complexity that is the human 
condition
should 
be 
interested 
in 
psychedelics.
They 
provide 
a 
doorway 
into 
the 
exploration
of 
consciousness 
and our shared experience on Earth.
As 
conscious 
beings,
we 
can 
think 
and 
strategise;
we 
are 
masters 
of 
our 
physical 
world. But 
our 
inner 
worlds 
are 
crumbling,
with 
epidemic 
levels 
of 
loneliness,
depression 
and 
anxiety
.
 
Business 
as 
usual 
is 
simply 
not 
enough. 
The 
prevailing 
rational 
and 
anti-spiritual 
attitude 
of 
our 
time 
does 
not 
satisfy 
our 
existential 
longing 
for 
meaning.
Just 
as 
we 
are 
shaped 
by 
our 
experiences,
we 
are 
also 
shaped 
 
by things we never contemplate.
Consider 
for 
a
moment 
that,
 
beneath 
the 
urgency 
of 
everyday 
life, 
t
here 
is 
boundless 
love, 
p
eace 
and 
connection 
dwelling in the depths of your being.
Psychedelics offer us 
a glimpse
into that
possibility
.
 
These states of enlightened 
ecstasy 
were 
once 
only 
available 
to 
a 
fortunate 
few
,
 
but 
now 
they 
are 
accessible

And, 
contrary
to 
popular 
belief,
psychedelics 
are 
safe 
when 
they 
are 
used 
properly
.
 
They 
can 
heal 
trauma 
with

naturally

and

What other compounds can do this?
Classic 
psychedelic 
compounds
include 
mescaline,
 
DMT
,
 
psilocybin 
and 
LS D.
The 
last 
two 
come 
from 
the 
fungi kingdom.
 
Before the hippie revolution of the 1960s,
before 
modern 
science 
and 
even 
before 
the 
written 
word,
our 
ancestors 
used 
psychedelics 
in
sacred 
ceremonies. 
At 
the 
core 
of 
these 
traditions, 
psychedelics 
were 
used 
to 
reconnect 
with 
the 
divine.
It 
was 
a 
way 
to 
reveal 
the 
god, 
or the soul,
 within.
 
Dr 
Humphry
Osmond,
an 
English 
psychiatrist 
known 
for 
his 
pioneering 
research 
into 
LSD,
coined 
the 
word 
'psychedelic' 
in 
his 
rhyme 
'to 
fathom 
Hell
or 
soar 
angelic, 
just 
take 
a 
pinch 
of 
psychedelic'
.
4
 
Psyche
means 
'so ul' in Greek,
and 
delos
m eans 
'manifes t i n g '; 
'
psychedelic' 
therefore 
means 
'so ul 
manifes t i n g '
or 
'to 
make
the 
soul 
appear'
.
 
More 
recently
,
 
the 
term 
'
entheogen'
,
 
meaning 
'revealing 
the 
god 
within'
,
 
has 
been 
used 
interchangeably
with 'psychedelic' in ceremonial or religious contexts.
Science 
has 
shown 
that,
at 
high 
doses,
psychedelics 
can 
reliably 
cause 
spiritual 
experiences.
However
,
 
concepts such as spirit
and soul can be abstract for people 
brought 
up 
in 
W
estern 
societies,
because 
they 
can't 
be 
seen, 
touched,
b ought 
or
rationalised.
As
such, 
the 
word 
 
'psyche'
has 
become 
synonymous 
with 
'mind'
,
 
and 
psychedelics are often defined as 
'mind manifes t i n g '
.
 
It'
s
time 
for 
our 
society 
to 
reconnect 
with 
the 
spiritual 
dimension 
of 
our 
existence. As 
Carl 
Sagan,
the 
celebrated 
American 
astronomer
, 
P ulitzer 
Prize-winning 
author 
and 
populariser 
of 
science,
reasoned,
'S cience 
is 
not 
only 
compatible 
with 
spirituality; 
it 
is 
a 
profound 
source 
of 
spirituality
.
 
When we recognise our place
in an immensity 
of 
light-years
and 
in 
the 
passage 
of 
ages, 
when 
we 
grasp 
the intricacy
,
 
beauty
,
 
and subtlety of life,
 
then that soaring 
feeling, 
that 
sense 
of 
elation 
and 
humility 
combined,
is 
surely 
spiritual.
The 
notion 
that 
science 
and 
spiritualit y 
are 
somehow
mutually 
exclusive 
does 
a
disservice 
to 
both.

Shamanistic cultures ha
ve long revered Earth as a spiritual,
 living 
entity
.
 
They believe that everything -
 from rocks and rivers to plants 
and fungi 
- i
s alive and contains a spiritual essence. S
acred ceremonies 
are held to connect with spiritual planes of existence.
 S ome tribes 
use fasting,
 drumming,
 dancing and chanting to induce ecstatic 
states.
 S ome also use psychoactive fungi and plants in rituals led 
by the shaman or medicine man or woman. 
These ceremonies seek 
out the intrinsic desire to connect with states larger than ourselves,
 
to reconnect with ancestors and gods.
 The shaman enters the 
spiritual realm and brings back knowled ge to heal illnesses, m
anage 
interpersonal relationships and ensure the long-term wellb eing of

psychoactive fungi,
 the Stoned 
Ape theory is a famous and enduring 
hypothesis put for ward in 1992 by 
T
e
rence McK
enna, ethnobotanist 
and crusader for the democratisation of entheogens.
 Historians accept 
that our ancestors left the forest canopies to explore Africa 2 million 
years ago.
 McKenna proposes that we have been in biological symbiosis 
with psychoactive mushrooms since we left the trees for the harsh 
savanna.
 There, we encountered mind-expanding 
Psilocybe
 mushrooms 
in cattle dung and consumed them as a nutritious source of food .
 
The 
evolutionary consequence of this dietary choice over millions of years 
gave rise to human cognition, 
self-awareness and creativity
.
 
This could provide an explanation for the rapid increase in brain 
size that is unique to our species
.
 
While fascinating to contemplate
,
 
the 
earliest archaeological evidence of the human-mushroom partnership 
dates back to 10,
000 B C E  and comes from cave paintings in the 
Sahara Desert.
 Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers used art to convey their 
stories,
 b eliefs and rituals. 
One cave painting depicts a looming figure 
with mushrooms growing throughout the outline of its body
,
 
likely 
to represent the powerful influence of mushrooms when consumed.
 
Mushroom references are shroude d in mystery
,
 
but they are embe dded 
throughout ancient cultures and religions.

 These were the holiest of all celebrations in Greece,
 attended 
by men and women from all ranks 
- priests,
 noble families and slaves.
 
Upon arriving at the T
emple of Demeter
, p
articipants in the religious 
ritual drank a potion called 
kykeon
.
 
Greek philosopher Plato described his visions at the Eleusinian 
Mysteries in his dialogues.
 In 
Phaedrus
, h
e wrote an ancient trip 
report:
 'we stood as initiates in a pure light, 
and we were pure and 
not entombed in this so- called body that we carry around with us,
 
imprison e d  l i ke  a n  oyster in its shell.
'
8
 This was the bas i s  o f  h i s  
concept of dualism: that the physical body and the soul are separate 
entities,
 and that the soul lives on after death.
 
The contents of 
kykeon
 fascinate historians,
 w
ho agree that  
there was a psychedelic component that facilitated the experience  
of the divine.
 The particular psy
chedelic used is still fiercely debated.  
The prevailing theory is that 
kykeon
 included a compound derived  
from ergot,
 a fungal mass that f
orms when the parasitic fungus 
Claviceps 
purpure
a
 colonises grain.
 Discov
eries of ergot remnants in a temple 
dedicated to two Eleusinian goddesses,
 excavat
ed in Spain,
 provide 
legitimacy for the theor y
.

 The Eleusinian M
ysteries ended in 392 CE,
 
when R
ome ruled Greece and imposed Christianity as a state religion.
Indigenous civilisations of Central and South America,
 such as 
the Maya,
 Aztec, Olmec and Zapotec, used psychoactive fungi and 
plants in healing and religious ceremonies for thousands of years.
These entheogens were sacred because of the states of ecstatic a
we  
that they could induce.
 Mushrooms, i
n particular
, w ere worshipped  
and called 
teonanácatl
 in the Nahuatl language of the Aztecs,
 meaning 
'flesh of the gods '
.
 
The Aztecs held night-long c eremonies using 
Psilocybe mexicana
, o r other 
Psilocybe
 species,
 w
hich were available 
after rains most times of the year
.
 
Change came to the 
Aztecs in the 16th century when the Spanish 
conquistadors
,
 
led by Hernán Cortés, d
escended upon them.
 The 
conquering Spanish army denounced the 
Aztec'
s ritualistic use of fungi 
and plants as it threatened their Catholic beliefs. The conquistadors 
argued that the Indigenous practice of using psychoactive substances to 
achieve godhood was demonic and blasphemous.
 O ne cleric wrote back 
to the king,
 
'
When they are eaten or drunk,
 they intoxicate,
 depriving 
those who partake of them of their senses and making them believe  
a thousand absurdities.

This last native Mesoamerican empire fell to the Spaniards in 
1521. Their school systems and cultural traditions
,
 
including the use of 
Psilocybe
 mushrooms,
 were suppressed and replaced with Catholicism.
 
This colonisation severed the Aztecs from their narratives, 
land and 
communities. B
ut the wisdom of the mushrooms endured by going 
underground.
 For hundreds of years, 
these divine mushrooms remained 
the stuff of myths and legends.
 People continued to use them in secret,

ledge from one generation to another

coloured photographs of María Sabina and the ceremony
.
 
For b etter 
or worse
,
 
this was a turning point for Huautla de Jiménez. The town 
was flooded with seekers of all kinds: artists,
 musicians,
 philosophers, 
hippies and scientists in search of 
veladas

the divine.

 He was the first to isolate the active

 Hoffman created a synthetic version of psilocybin as

 These were presented to María Sabina,

confirmed that ' the spirit of the mushroom is in the pill'

With that, 
the effe cts of these ancient rituals were scientifically attributed to one

the absolute truth -
 has been revealed. He had peered beyond the veil  
of the socially constructed reality
.
 
When Leary returned to Harvard after that summer
, h
e created 
the Harvard Psilocybin Project and ordered psilocybin from Sandoz. 
Along with Richard Alpert, who would later be known as Ram Dass,
 
and graduate students Ralph Metzner
, G
unther W
eil and George 
Litwin,
 the team set off to understand the frontiers of consciousness.
 
Ram Dass reflects on this time in his book 
Be Her
e No w
: 
'W
e were 
exploring  t h i s  i n n e r  r e a l m  o f  c on s c i o u s n e s s  that we  h a d  b e e n  
theorising about all these years and suddenly we were tra
velling  
in and through and around it.
'
22
Leary attracted artists,
 philosophers and scientists and shared 
psychedelic experiences with notable figures such as Aldous Hu xley
,
 
Alan W
at ts, William S Burroughs and Carl Sagan. Through hundreds  
of sessions, t
he trailblazing team coined the term 
'
s
e
t and setting'
,
 
which are huge determinants of the experience.
 
'
S e t '
 refers to the 
mindset of the person taking the psychedelic
.
 
Having clear intentions,
 
being in a good headspace and respecting the sacred medicine can 
significantly impact the experience.
 
'
Setting
'
 
refers to the physical and 
social environment.
 For an introspective  journey
,
 
a safe environment 
with trusted companions or guides creates a container for healing.
With these insights,
 the Harvard Psilocybin Project set up the 
Concord Prison Experiment. The team wanted to see if psilocybin 
could transf
orm the prisoners'
 a
wareness to help them sta
y out of 
prison,
 reducing the recidivism rate.
 
T
hey also conducted the famous 
Good Frida
y Experiment, designed by 
W
a
lter Pahnke, a
 graduate 
student at Harvard Divinity School.
 The goal of the Good Frida
y 
Experiment was to understand if psilocybin could stimulate the same 
mystical experiences that occur naturally in religious states.
23
 
These experiments were controversial. Colleagues questioned 
the researchers'
 study methods,
 data analysis and tendency to take 
psychedelics with study volunteers.
 Frequent psychedelic sessions,
 
which by this time included LS D
, were also held outside the campus,
 
drawing criticism from other faculty memb ers. They were accused 
of blurring the line between researching psychedelics and promoting 
their recreational use.
 The criticism from his colleagues didn'
t land well 
with Leary
'
s anti-authoritarian and outspoken disposition.
 
L e a r y
,
 
with 
the suppor t of the prominent poet and writer Allen Ginsberg,
 wanted 
to democratise access to psychedelics.
 They wanted regular people 
outside the circles of privilege and academia to access greater states 
of consciousness.
 The Harvard Psilocybin Project ended by 1963 w
hen 
both Leary and Alpert were more or less fired from Harvard .
They continued to push the psychedelic mindset to release human 
potential from within the culture. L e a r y '
s urging to 
'
Tu rn on,
 tune in,
 
drop out'
 wasn't  a message for youth to leave their schools,
 jobs and 
families and do drugs, a
s the media had por trayed it.
 In its essence,
 
Leary meant :

from the Beat Generation. As a direct rebellion to the consumerist 
mindset of the 1950s, t
hey celebrated their connection to the Earth 
rather than placing value on money
,
 
material possessions and status 
symbols.
 The counterculture was trying to answer a classic question:  
Is there an answer to the suffering in the world?
In a time when trust in the government reached a new low
,
 
disillusioned youth were looking f
or an antidote to the turbulent times 
they lived in. 
Psilocybin and LSD provided immediate answers: they 
shifted world views, t
urned on ecological awareness and cultivated 
a tribal intimacy
.
 
Psychedelics gave them a firsthand exploration of 
the big questions. They had a new lens to use to look at the nature of 
reality
,
 
life '
s meaning and how to live with peace and harmony
.
 
It was  
as if this renewe d expression of ancient rituals returned a piece of  
the sacred to the youth.
 For centuries,
 wise Indigenous cultures have 
used sacred mushrooms for awakenings. Th ese rites of passage are 
carefully guide d, 
and the profound experiences they generated become 
deeply integrated into their wa

 were all borne out of

In the wake of the war on drugs,
 the US government made 
psychedelic comp ounds as restricte d and unavailable as possible.
 They 
were declared Schedule I substances, a
 categor y on par with heroin and 
crack cocaine,
 and other countries followed. This classification meant 
that psychedelics were considered to ha
ve no medical value and a high 
potential for abuse.
 This is despite decades of genuine, groundbreaking 
research on their immense medical value and near zero abuse potential.
 
Without funding for scientific studies,
 researchers had to abandon 
promising a
venues of research.
 Even with funding,
 they had to navigate 
the red tape of the US  D r u g  Enforcement Administration (DEA) to 
request an exemption, 
which was nearly impossible. 
The last fragments 
of interest in psychedelics went underground once again.
 The flame 
was carried by researchers and therapists who continued to work in 
secret, passing on their invaluable knowledge.

Psychedelics were taboo in science f
or decades.
 I
t wasn'
t until a landmark 
study published in 2006 by Dr Rol
and Griffiths and his team at Johns 
Hopkins University that scientific credibility returned to psychedelic 
research.
 The study convincingly showed that psychedelics could 
produce remarkable eff
ects when used correctly and that they at least 
deserve d further investigation.
 Psychedelics are no longer solely seen  
as recreational drugs.
Griffiths,
a
psychopharmacologist,
has studied mood-altering drugs 
for over f
ort y years. H
is meditation practice led to his curiosity about 
spiritual experiences and transf
ormation.
 Griffiths had heard of the 
experiments using psilocybin and LS D in the 1950s and 1960s that led 
to religious-like experiences
,
 
particularly the Good Friday Experiment 
conducted by the team at Harvard. But it was R
obert Jesse, the founder 
of the non-profit Council on Spiritual Practices whose mission was to 
revive the science of psychedelics,
 w
ho ultimately convinced Griffiths 
to research psychedelics. 
In 1999,
 R
oland Griffiths,
 R
obert Jesse, William Richards,
 Una 
McCann and Mar y Cosimano set off to understand the effects of 
psilocybin using rigorous study methodologies that were different to 
those of earlier studies.
 Their goal was to understand the immediate 
and long-term effects of psilocybin on healthy volunteers in a saf
e 
environment. Getting approval to mobilise this study was no easy 
feat.
 It took Griffiths and his col leagues a year to navigate the red tape 
with the FD
A ,
 the DEA and their institutional review board at Johns 
Hopkins. I
t became the first study in over three decades to administer 
a psychedelic compound to participants,
 sparking the beginning of the 
psychedelic renaissance.
The team designed a double-blind,
 active pla c e b o - controlled study 
- t
he gold standard in research.
 The study compared psilocybin with 
an active control compound called methy
lphenidate, also known as 
Ritalin.
 Participants received 30 milligrams of psilocybin,
 e quivalent 
to roughly 5 grams of dried 
Psilocybe cubensis
, p
er 70 kilograms of 
body weight. The team took care to select volunteers with no prior

 The title itself was groundbreaking. 
Scientific papers rarely
,
 
if ever
,
 
reference spirituality
,
 
personal meaning 
or mystical experiences.
 But the study'
s meticulous design,
 execution 
and data analysis commanded the attention of the scientific community
.
L e t '
s break down the title of the study
.
 
The first conclusion was 
that psilocybin could elicit exp eriences identical to natural mystical-
type experiences.
 These are the same states that ha
ve been described  
by spiritual leaders,
 such as shamans,
 priests and other religious figures,
 
throughout history
.
 
This finding suggests that spiritual experiences are 
biologically normal,
 irrespective of an individual'
s
 religious belief
. S
ix 
defining characteristics of mystical exp eriences formed the f
oundation 
of a questionnaire.
 If all six criteria increased after taking psilocybin,
 it 
qualified as a mystical exp erience.
 O ver 60 per cent of participants met 
the criteria f
or a complete mystical experience after taking psilocybin.
 
The six criteria are:
 
Feelings of unity:
 A s
trong sense of the interconnectedness of  
all people and things.
 
A
 
sense that all is one.
2 
A sense of sacredness:
 A f eeling of awe, h
umility and reverence.
3 
Noetic quality: Knowing that what is being experienced is more  
real and more true than everyday reality
.
 
Deeply felt positive mood: Feelings of peace,
 ecstasy
,
 
joy and 
universal love.
5 
Transcendence of time and space: Loss or disruption of usual  
sense of time and space.
6 
Ineffability:
 A s
ense that the experience could not be adequately 
described in words.
These mystical-type experiences are correlated with positive 
therapeutic benefits.
 Over 80 per cent said their sense of wellbeing and 
life satisfaction increased after the experience 
-
 
n
o one said it decreased.
Finally
,
 
questionnaires completed by participants after the study 
showed that the spiritual significance of the exp erience persisted .
 
There were long-term,
 p ositive personality changes,
 including their 
sense of self and lif
e pur pose.
 The participants '
 
family members and 
friends confirmed these changes.
 
Griffiths remarked that throughout his research career
, h
e had 
never seen anything so unique, powerful and enduring regarding the 
impact of a drug experience.
29
 The study showed that it is possible 
to objectively observe the psychedelic effects of psilocybin, 
reuniting 
science and spirituality
.
 
It opened other avenues f
or research,
 including 
neuroscience and clinical applications for mental health illnesses such 
as depression,
 
anxiety
,
 
addictions and obsessions.

For some evolutionary reason,
 w
hen we consume certain species 
of fungi it can trigger altered states of consciousness,
 including 
extraordinary changes in awareness,
 p erception,
 
cognition,
 
emotions 
and mood.
 These changes create a psychedelic experience that 
transcends our physical reality
,
 
so descriptions of it are inevitably 
watered down. But the fact that we continue to try
,
 
through language, 
art and science,
 elucidates their spellbinding power on our psyche. 
This psychedelic experience is due to a set of naturally occurring 
compou n d s  i n  f u n g i  t h a t  are psychoactive, t
hat is,
 that interact  
with human physiological functions.
 The main active compounds  
in psychoactive fungi are psilocybin and psilocin.
Psilocybin and psilocin can be found in psychoactive fungi 
throughout their life cycle,
 in sporing bodies, m ycelium and sclerotia.
 
Sclerotia is a mass of compacted mycelium -
 it '
s sclerotia that is sold as 
magic truffles in the N
etherlands.
 Although other psychoactive fungi 
exist,
 such as 
Amanita muscaria
 and ergot,
 from which LSD is derived ,
 
psilocybin-c ontaining mushrooms are the most prevalent in ancient 
cultures and in current scientific studies.
In 1958, 
A l b ert Hoffman f
ound that psilocybin was a more 
stable molecule than psilocin, which made it easier to synthesise and 
store. Psilocin oxidises and loses its potency very quickly
.
 
This can be 
observed in the blue br uising that occurs when mushrooms are picked .
 
The stability of psilocybin is why researchers use psilocybin pills in 
controlled studies.
Psilocybin mushrooms typically fall into the 
Psilocybe
genus but 
are found in other genera too, 
such as 
Gymnopilus
 and 
Panaeolus
.
 S
o
far
, o ver 200 species of fungi are known to contain psilocybin,
 and they 
are found across all continents except Antarctica.
 They are saprophytes 
that absorb nutrients f
or g rowth from decaying matter
, s
uch as manure 
and dead plant material.
 Their relatively simple growth cycle on a

In the last two decades,
 new brain-scanning technologies have
 propel led 
neuroscience and our understanding of ho
w psilocybin affe cts the brain.
 
But our know
ledge is incomplete. 
W
e
 do not yet understand how the 
changes in the brain caused b
y psilocybin give rise to the cascade of  
psychedelic effe cts.
 Here is what we know so far
.
When psilocybin is ingested, the body metab olises psilocybin into 
psilocin.
 This is a crucial detail:
 psilocybin and psilocin are both f
ound 
in the mushroom,
 
but only psilocin acts on the brain.
 
Psilocin is similar in structure to serotonin, a neurotransmitter 
that regulates our moods.
 It is so similar that psilocin can hijack the 
receptors in the brain that are reserved f
or serotonin.
 This structural 
similarity may indicate a co- evolutionar y development between the 
brain and psychedelic compounds
.
 
Psilocin can bind to a significant 
number of serotonin receptors in the brain, with a strong affinity for 
a certain type cal led the 5-HT2A receptor
.
 
A
 study showe d that if the 
5 - H T 2A rec eptor is blocked ,
 
no psychedelic effe cts occur
.
30
Therefore, 
the activation of these receptors app ears to be critical for initiating 
psychedelic effe cts.
 However
, i
t is still not known how the activation  
of serotonin receptor sites creates the psychedelic experience.
A team,
 led by Dr R
obin Carhart-Harris and Professor Da
vid N
utt 
from Imperial College London and funded by the Beckley Foundation,
 
invest igated the effe cts of psilocybin on the brain in 2012.
 They used 
functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan the brains of vol unteers 
on psilocybin
.
 
Using blood flow as a measure of brain activity
,
 
the team 
found that activity decreased in a part of the brain called the default 
mode network.
31
Interestingly
,
 
this area is also home to a large
proportion 
of 5-H T2A receptors.
The default mode network is an interconnected group of brain 
regions that play
 a central role in brain function
s
,
 
like a conductor in an 
orchestra.
 This network also plays a n important role in consciousness.
 
It is associa
ted with metacognitiv
e function
s
,
 
such as the ability to time 
trave l (i.e.
 to think about past and future ev
ents
)
,
 
contemplate ourselves 
with introspective a
wareness
,
 
and empathise with other people'
s 
perspectives
.
 
This part of our brain helps us f
orm our identity
,
 
allowing 
us to define who we are and how that is projected to the outside world
.
 
Loosely put
,
 
the default mode network is w
here our ego lives
 
-  the 
feeli ng of our individual identity
.
 
It is also w
here critical self-talk tak
es

When the activit y in the 
default mode network quietens,
 
it releases its grip as the central 
conductor
. P ersonal narratives 
recede,
 allowing an escape from 
habitual thinking and defences.
 
When the rigid boundaries of 
the mind dissolve, t
he sense of 
self can diminish or disapp ear
,
 
which is called ego dissolution.
 Another effe ct of a muted default 
mode network is that other parts of the brain that don'
t normally 
communicate with each other start to form new connections.
 
One such phenomenon is synesthesia,
 w
hen the senses seem to 
blend together
. F or example,
 w
hen the gustatory cortex speaks to the 
visual cortex, 
you can 
'
taste'
 c olours.
 This hyperconnectivit y facilitates 
unconstrained cognition,
 spontaneous insight and creativity
.
33
 
In this open state,
 the brain is more flexible
,
 
so there is a chance 
to rewire it.
 Freedom from the ego creates a space that can allow 
repressed emotions or states of bliss to surface.
 
W
hen the curtain 
lifts,
 a constellation of new realisations,
 p erspectives and fe elings 
about life punctuates the experience. This can create lasting personal 
transformations if these learnings are integrated into daily lif
e.
Ego dissolution is temp orary
.
 
The default mode network is 
necessary for us to function in our complex society
,
 
and it starts 
up again as the psilocybin experience winds down. 
The window 
of opp ortunity is only open for about six hours,
 but when used 
intentionally this brief period of time can provide insights that last 
a lifetime. Dr Stanisla

 How consciousness is borne from 
an assembly of neurons in the brain is still far from being understood. 
Unless we are asking the wrong questions 
-
 
d
oes consciousness operate 
independently of the body?
 
W
hateve r the answer is,
 
c
onsciousness is 
built into our subjectiv

a sense of self

Psilocybin-assisted therapy involves using psilocybin in conjunction 
with a form of talk
-therapy to heal underlying psychological 
conditions
.
 
The therapeutic approach is tailored to the participant  
and their condition.
 Psilocybin-assisted therapy has three stages,
 all  
of which are critical for the therapy
'
s effectiveness and safety
.
Preparator y sessions bet ween the guide and participant establish 
trust and rapport,
 
which are critical during the psilocybin experience.
 
A saf
e environment allows the participants to be vulnerable and 
share intimate details about their life story
.
 
These details often come 
up during the psilocybin experience.
 The guide will also prepare the 
participants by informing them about what to exp ect, and how to 
navigate challenging experiences if they arise.
During the psilocybin session,
 the participant lies down in a safe,
 
comfortable environment that has been specifically designed f
or them. 
They are encouraged to go inwards with the aid of an eye mask and 
headphones that pla
y a curated music play
list.
 The guide is there f
or 
reassurance and supp ort in challenging situations. 
In this environment,
 
the body
'
s innate self-healing ability is given the space to switch on.
  
Just as the body knows to heal an open wound,
 it can guide the 
participants to areas of the psyche that need healing.
The end of the psilocybin session is when the work starts.

,
 
psilocybin can dissolve the lines that we dra

around ourselves in times of crisis.
 It can unlock deep traumas. These 
experiences need to be held in a safe container with a trusted guide 
so that the insights from the session can be integrated into daily life 
moving forward.

It was during our fifth psilocybin study
,
 
'Effec ts of psilocybin and spiritual 
practice on persisting changes in attitudes and behavior'
,
 
at Johns Hopkins that  
I began to understand the teachings of the psilocybin mushroom on a deeper level
.
 
The purpose of this study was to investigate how psilocybin, 
when combined with 
spiritual practices such as meditation,
 
could affect the beha
viour and attitudes 
of participants
.
 
Participants were given questionnaires that measured the level 
of mystical experience and states of consciousness they encountered during the 
psilocybin session
,
 
foll owed by a persisting effects questionnaire three weeks later
.
In 2011,
 approximately t wo years into this study
,
 
I was conducting the 
psychological assessments,
 a pre- screening process that was mandatory for 
participants to enter the study
.
 
During many conversations,
 I began noticing 
the difficulty and disconnect many participants were experiencing due to the 
word '
spiritual'
,
 
which was present in the name of the study
.
 
This word often has 
significant baggage associated with it, as does the word ' religious '
.
 
I felt a need to 
make sense of this,
 b ecause I believed that, 
deep down, 
the essence of our studies 
are well beyond either of these words.
I realised the phrase 'authentic or true self
'
 was more accurate than the 
word '
spiritual'
.
 
This seemed to resonate with many participants,
 as it was less 
confusing.
 I came to believe that the power of the psilocybin mushroom was 
that it seemed to act as a key that op ens our minds and allows access to the part 
of ourselves that is our 
'tr ue self
'
.
 
This 'true self
'
 can emerge w
hen the blocks or 
barriers we have constructed have been removed.
I began to see that what we describe as our authentic selves are our true 
nature.
 And that our true nature is love, w hich I believe is our connection,
 our 
relationship -
 to ourselves
,
 
to others and to everything.
 D eep down it is what  
we all want, 
to love and be love d .
 It is our true essence and who we are.
 
W
e
 came 
into the world knowing this,
 but as we grow
,
 
we often become disconnected from 
this know
ledge.
 
We make our lives so complicated. Then we develop f
ears and, 
because of our fears, 
we put up walls and barriers that disconnect us,
 and thus 
we lose our sense of who we are 
- o ur true authentic self
. I
 believe our psilocybin 
studies are about reconnecting to our authentic or true self no matter the age,
 
socioeconomic status or cultural background.
 When someone experiences this 
it is often a familiar f
eeling, comfortable,
 like coming home
.
 
As one participant 
wrote of their experience,
 
'
The whol e  journey was on the spiritual plane where 
thoughts,
 understanding and words are completely
,
 
100 per cent irrelevant.  
I was in the playground of trust and knowing. I
 was free from the binds of my 
overactive mind.
 I was free from density
.
 
I was in my element.
 This is my home. 
This is what I know is my true self.
'
This conviction 
- l
ove and connection to our true
,
 
authentic self -
 addresses 
what I believe is one of the main outcomes of our psilocybin studies.
 As  one 
participant put it: 
' Everything is swept up into a climactic epiphany of love as  
the universal essence and meaning of all things.

The core teaching,
 as I said,
 is an increase in a core sense of self
, a
 deep-rooted 
knowingness of our true,
 authentic self
.  And an interconnectedness to all of 
life 
- a
 knowing that we are all one,
 all connecte d .
The result of knowing w
ho we truly are translates into a desire to be 
a better person 
-  to ourselves
,
 
to others,
 and to the world. Participants have 
reported significant increases in quality of lif
e and personal meaning beyond 
the psilocybin experience.
 
T
hey have shared feelings of deep gratitude and the 
importance of forgiveness and compassion f
or self and all,
 and priorities shifting 
- a wareness of what'
s impor tant and letting go of what '
s not and decreasing petty 
concerns and holding onto grudges.
The following is a beautiful summary from one of our participants.
  
'I am more interested in connecting with others on a deeper level, 
and value 
relationships more.
 I am more op en and less judgemental.
 I have a greater sense  
of love
as being a unifying and primal f
orce
in the universe and as the appropriate 
response to my understanding of reality
.
'
Finally
,
 
I would like to share how these past twent y years ha
ve impacted 
me personally
.
 
On one hand,
 I could write volumes, 
yet on the other
, t
here is 
no way to put it into words -
 it is ineffable
.
 
Thus, I will end on this note. 
Being 
an integral part of our participants' lives and their experiences these past two 
decades has deepened my existing belief that love is everything to a level I'
d not 
known bef
ore.
 Globally
,
 
I wish for these medicines to be available to all those 
who are ready for it, meaning they are medically and psychologically safe to 
receive it and the potential value it can have for them and the world.

In their natural f

pounds,

they are still generally 
dosed by w

A r
ule of thumb is that 
fresh mushrooms weigh ten times more 
than dried mushroom
s
,
 
due to their high 
water content. 
Mushrooms can be consumed fresh  
or dried in any number of ways
.
 
They can 
be blended into a drink,
 steeped in hot 
water to make a tea,
 chewed or cooked 
as food. 
Depending on the consumption 
method, it can take twenty to sixty minutes 
for the psychedelic effe cts to begin.
 
Traditional rituals include a fast 
of at least six hours bef
ore c onsuming 
mushrooms.
 An empty stomach can 
improve the spiritual experience and  
help avoid nau s e a ,
 w
hich is a possible  
side effect. Consuming mushrooms  
without fasting can dela
y the onset  
of the psychedelic eff
ects.
There is no 
'typical'
 psilocybin 
experience.
 There are many variables

Psychedelics are one of the safest drugs.
 In a study of twenty drugs,
 the 
U K '
s Independent Scientific Committee on Dr ugs ranked psilocybin as 
least harmful and LS D as the third-least harmful.
 Alcohol was ranked 
the most harmful 
- m ore than ten times as harmful as psilocybin and 
L S D  
- f ollowed by heroin and crack cocaine.
37
Psychedelics are not addictive and do not harm the body or 
brain.
38
 But there are some people who should never take psychedelics, 
including those with a personal or family history of psychotic 
disorders.
 Psychedelics can also aff
ect blood pressure and heart rate, 
 
so people with heart conditions may also be at risk.
 Psilocybin-assisted 
therapy uses extensive questionnaires to determine the suitabilit y of  
a participant bef
ore administering psilocybin.
Proper preparation is the deciding factor between a challenging 
experience 
- o ne from w
hich you can grow and integrate 
- a
nd a bad 
trip.
 A b ad trip is characterised by f
eelings of anxiety
,
 
fear
,
 
paranoia,
 
panic and resistance to w
hatever is unf
olding
.
 
Because emotions are 
intensified during a psychedelic experience, n
ew feelings,
 thoughts 
or experiences that arise can be difficult to manage if the person is 
underprepared or inexperienced.
Set and setting are the key determinants to a positive experience.
 
Understand w
hat your intention is and commit to accepting what 
the psychedelics show you.
 As k a trusted friend or family member to 
sit with you for support. Optimise your surroundings

But it all starts with acceptance. Resistance is what causes a bad trip.
 
Remember that the trip always ends.
 Integration is the key to all trips,
 
especially a challenging one.
 What affe cts you deeply during a trip is 
probably something in your psyche that you have not resolve d .
 It is  
best if this is met with further inquiry and compassion.

Since the 2006 landmark study by Griffiths and his colleagues,
 the 
FDA
 has approve d over fifty clinical research studies using psilocybin.
 
The idea that psychedelics can play a huge role in alleviating human 
suffering is now a legitimate scientific research area.
 N
ew studies 
looking to treat depression,
 end-of-life anxiety
,
 
post-traumatic stress 
disorder
, a
norexia,
 alcoholism,
 
smoking addiction, Alzheim e r '
s disease 
and a host of other conditions are underwa
y
.
 The applications are 
seemingly infinite
,
 
although researchers, heeding the mistakes of 
the 1960s,
 are cautious
.
 
Research efforts are being led by renowned 
universities such as Johns Hopkins University
,
 
New Y
ork University
,
 
Imperial College London and University of Califor n i a ,
 Berkeley
,
 
all  
of whom have opened centres dedicated to psychedelic research.
The study of consciousness and psychedelics is also becoming an 
accepted course of study for graduate students.
 Areas of research range 
from studies into the effe cts of microdosing psychedelics,
 the long-
term effe cts of psychedelics on the brain,
 future design of psychedelic-
assisted therapies and even activities outside medicine, s
uch as 
anthropolo g y
,
 
art, music, computer science,
 philosophy and religion.
Psychedelic research has returned during a deepening mental 
health crisis.
 The statistics are truly sobering: over 1 billion people 
worldwide now live with a mental health issue,
 with depression 
being the most significant factor f
or suicides.
 In the US,
 depression 
among adults more than tripled between 2018 and 2021.

30 per cent of patients with depression are resistant to treatment.  
The world urgently needs new solutions. The current treatment options 
for depression include psychotherapy
,
 
usually supplemented with a 
daily antidepressant calle d a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor 
( S S R I).
 S S R I s  work by muting the brain'
s stress system,
 but this doesn't
 
address the root cause of depression and can cause a host of side effe cts.
Dr Carhart-Harris and his team at Imperial Col lege London 
are adding to the growing body of research proving that psilocybin-
assisted therapy can treat depression.
 In April 2021,
 they published

S
two sessions of psilocybin-assisted therapy against a daily dose of 
escitalopram, 
a n  S S RI widely considered the best antidepressant on 
the market. 
The escitalopram group also receive d the same form of 
psychotherapy as the psilocybin-assisted therapy group.
The researchers calculated depression scores for each participant 
and the average depression score for each group. At the end of six 
weeks, the average depression score in both groups reduce d without 
significant diff
erences
,
 
showing that two doses of psilocybin-
assisted therapy are at least as effe ctive as sixty-three daily doses of 
escitalopram. That ma
y seem immaterial,
 but the psilocybin group 
reduced their depression scores faster
.
 Al so, 
70 per cent of the 
participants in the psilocybin group at least halved their depression 
scores,
 c ompared with 48 per cent of participants in the escitalopram 
group. Of the people who experience d a reduction in depression 
symptoms,
 
t
wice as many maintained it at the end of six weeks in the 
psilocybin group than those in the escitalopram group. Th ese results 
are extremely promising.
Dr Carhart-Harris believes that participants who experience d 
the psilocybin-assisted therapy sessions were given an opportunity 
to liberate themselves from the imprisonment of their ruminating 
minds.
 O nce free from their obsessive, d ominating stories,
 they were 
able to unearth repressed thoughts and emotions and work through 
them more objectively
.
 
In contrast,
 escitalopram and other SS RIs do 
not address the ro ot causes of depression.
 
They level out a person'
s 
depression symptoms by inhibiting responses in the brain.
 D r Carhart-
Harris hop es to conduct a longer-term study in other sites on a more 
diverse population of participants
.
 
If successful,
 those with depression 
may ha
ve a new treatment option in the near future that requires fewer 
doses and has fewer side effects.
Scientific researchers aren'
t the only ones interested in the 
potential of psychedelics. Mainstream media,
 regulators,
 c ompanies 
and individual advocates across many fields are excited about the 
future of psychedelics,
 too. The attitudes of regulatory bodies are also 
changing.
 In the US,
 the FDA
 advanced psilocybin studies into phase II 
trials.
 In 2018,
 it granted 
'
breakthrough therapy
'
 status to a psilocybin-
assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression run by Compass,
 
a life sciences company
.
 
This means that the FDA
 has placed clinical 
significance on the preliminary results of the trial'
s efficacy
.
 
The FDA
 
will fast-track its review process for the final phases of clinical trials,
 
likely making Compass the first in line to bring psilocybin-assisted 
therapy to market. 
Compass became a publicly listed company on 
NASD
AQ in September 2020 and is the first psychedelics company 
to reach a market capitalisation of over US$1 billion.
In the last few years,
 there has been an influx of companies 
entering the psychedelics industry
.

With more companies creating novel compounds based on 
psilocybin,
 debates concerning the ethics of patenting a naturally 
occurring compound 
- h
owever modified -
 are developing. Patents 
have also been filed for entirely new psychedelic compounds and 
methods of psychedelic-assisted therapy
.
 Of course,
 investment does 
fund research and development, 
build clinical infrastructure and fast-
track commercialisation models to distribute medicine to those in need.
 
But concerns have been raised about the potential monopolisation of 
psychedelic medicines by for -profit companies that are largely driven 
by shareholder returns
.
 
This leads to more questions about how we can ensure equal 
access to these medicines and how they will be administered.
 The 
current medical model only allows patients with an approved diagnosis 
to be treated within the medical system.
 This neglects those w
ho don't 
fit the prescrib ed indications, 
and further
,
 
the cost of this acc ess route 
may be prohibit ive. 
Low socioe conomic groups have a higher risk 
factor for mental illness, and policymakers need to prioritise their 
access to these and other potentially revolutionary treatments.
43
These are necessary debates as we create the first framework 
for psychedelic medicine in the W
estern world. L e t '
s not forget that 
psychedelic research and therapies owe much of their success to the 
traditions of Indigenous groups around the world. It is essential to 
acknowledge these custodians and their healing practices,
 w
hich we 
borrow and base our studies on. 
Indigenous groups need to be allowed 
to move out of the marginalised sidelines and be given a sa
y about the 
development of a new healthcare system.
 For those who are willing to 
align their work in the field of psychedelics to a set of guiding values, 
the pledge developed by the advocacy group North Star is the first step.
 
The North Star Ethics Pledge involves c ommitting to a set of values
,
 
with additional education and actionable steps to ensure psychedelic 
wisdom and integrity is woven into the growing psychedelic industry

The Schedule I classification of many psychedelics was more likely due 
to politics in the 1970s than the scientific potential of the comp ounds.
 
Throughout the psychedelic '
dark ages'
 that followe d, 
the non-profit 
Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MA PS) was the 
leading force for scientific research and education on safe and beneficial 
uses of psychedelics.
 Its founder
, R
ick Doblin, was an underg raduate at 
Harvard during Leary
'
s Harvard Psilocybin Project days, a
nd dedicated 
his career to furthering psychedelics in medical and legal contexts by 
combining drug development with drug policy reform. 
After thirty-five years, 
M A P S  is close to achieving FDA
 approval 
for M D M A
-assisted psychotherapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder
.
 
It is in phase II I trials,
 the furthest level of clinical development in 
the US for any psychoactive substance. As an advocate for the healing 
potential of all types of psychedelics,
 D oblin believes that '
Psychedelics 
must be legalised and regulated to some extent to permit therap eutic 
applications to occur without fear of prosecution'
.
45
 As we enter a 
psychedelic society
,
 
drug reforms across the world are unfolding.
In May 2019,
 D enver became the first city in the US to 
decriminalise 
'the use and possession of mushrooms containing the 
psychedelic comp ound psilocybin'
.
46
 In quick succession, 
Oakland,
 
W
a
s
hington DC,
 
A
n
n Arbor
,
 S anta Cruz and the state of Oregon 
also move d to lower the penalties associated with personal use and 
cultivation of psilocybin mushrooms.
 D ecriminalisation means that 
psychedelics are still illegal,
 but it will be the lowest priority f
or law 
enforcement. Many cities and states are expected to follow suit.

to be medical doctors but will need to undergo training to help guide 
psychedelic experiences from preparation through the trip itself and 
integration afterwards. Adults will not need to get a prescription or 
visit a medical setting to access psilocybin. 
Psilocybin remains illegal 
outside of these licensed service centres.
 
In June 2021,
 the California State Senate passed Senate Bill 519
,  
a legislation that d e c r i m i n a l i s e s  p s y chedelics,
 i n c l u d i n g  p s i l o c y bi n   
and LSD.
 The bill needs to be passed by the California Assembly before 
it becomes law
.
 
If this happens,
 then criminal penalties for growing,
 
possessing and sharing psychedelics will be removed f
or adults over 
twenty-one years of age, effectively legalising psychedelics.
 California 
was a pioneering state in the legalisation of medicinal cannabis in 
1996 and is poised to lead the US 
- a
nd the world -
 into psychedelic 
legalisation and a new era of drug policy reform.
W
e
 
can expect psychedelic companies to enter regions that 
implement a form of legalisation.
 
In other countries, 
such as Canada,
 
the UK and A
ustralia,
 there is also a trend towards de criminalisation 
and legalisation being led by grassroots activists.
As the psychedelic future gains momentum, so too does the 
underground network of psychedelics.
 With a vast amount of resources 
available from websites such as Shroomery and Erowid,
 p eople can 
source, grow and consume psychedelics in their homes.
 A h idden 
industry also exists for professional guides to facilitate the use of 
psychedelics in a saf
e and suppor tive environment for individuals w
ho 
have limited treatment options. Alternatively
,
 
countries such as Jamaica 
and the Netherlands off
er a form of legal psilocybin. 
Synthesis,
 an 
organisation based in Amsterdam, offers a three-
 or five- day medically 
supervised psilocybin truffle retreat.
 However
, f or those who have fears 
of persecution or cannot afford to tra
vel, 
their hopes remain tethered  
to the legalisation of such comp ounds in their local regions.
Cultural commentators drive the dissemination of psychedelic 
news and education. Using their expertise and varied communication 
platforms, they are shifting the public perception of psychedelics.

we hope that 
psychedelics and the sacred rituals they stem from are respe cted.
 O ur 
ancestors approached these natural medicines with reverence,
 love and

and we must do the same.
 The psilocybin mushroom should

The power of psychedelics go es beyond therapeutic applications. 
 
As scientific studies have proven, psychedelics can reliably induce 
mystical states of consciousness,
 suggesting that we are biologically 
wired to have these experiences. B
ut what are altered states of 
consciousness? More importantly
,
 
what can we learn from entering 
higher states of consciousness? 
Consciousness is a mysterious phenomena,
 so the term has 
different definitions depending on the context. 
One way to understand 
consciousness is to see it as the medium through w
hich we experience 
the subjective world around and within us.
 O ur level of consciousness 
is measured by our level of awareness and attention.
 This determines 
the quality of our experience of life and how 
'tr uly alive'
 
we fe el. 
Our 
level of consciousness changes throughout the da
y
.
 
In deep sleep, a
ll 
conscious thoughts and emotions are shut off -
 there is no awareness.
 
The dreaming stage involves a string of images,
 thoughts and sensory 
experiences, b
ut our level of awareness of w
hat is happening is low
.
 
When we are awake
,
 
our levels of awareness also range.
 Most of us 
are in a waking sleep
,
 
doing tasks mindlessly while our attention is 
elsewhere. 
Think about the hours spent caught up in our own narrative 
rather than being in the present moment.
 
T
o
 be fully awake and present 
requires fo cus and practice.
 
Consciousness is always total and complete 
- i
t merely appears 
clouded and foggy because of our attachments,
 labels and other 
illusions.
 For thousands of years, 
Eastern philosophies such as 
Hinduism and Buddhism ha
ve shared the practice of mindfulness 
to help bring our wandering minds back into the present moment. 
During these times of quality presence, we can reach a higher state of 
consciousness
.
 
These moments allow us to witness the nature of our 
experience with full clarity
,
 
without being captured by thoughts of the 
past or future.
 
A
llowing such states of consciousness to punctuate your 
day is not an abstract idea ,
 nor is it confined to spirituality or religion.

T
hen we seek love and belonging in a community
.
 
Then we craft 
our individual identity with achievements and respect from others.
 
Once these deficiency needs are fulfilled, we seek self-actualisation.
 
 
'
A

e music,
 
a
n artist must paint,
 a poet must write  
if he is to be ultimately happy
,
'
 
Maslow said.
 
'
What a man can be,
 he 
must be.
'
 
48
 But he wasn'
t finished.
Before Maslow'
s death in 1970,
 he was working on the concept 
of peak experiences 
- t
he final step after self-actualisation. Humans 
need to grow beyond our individual identities.
 
W
e
 need to transcend 
ourselves,
 explore humanity and love nature and others
.
 
A p erson

and their surroundings, 
and these experiences are characterised by 
states of ecstasy
,
 
wonder and joy 
-  the same qualities of higher states  
of consciousness.
'In the last few years it has become quite clear that certain drugs 
called "psychedelics"
,
 
especially LS D and psilocybin,
 give us some 
possibility of control in this realm of peak- exp eriences,
'
 
said Maslow 
in his 1964 book 
Religions, V
a
lues, 
and Peak-
Experiences
.
 
'
It looks as if 
these drugs often produce 'peak- experiences'
 in the right people under 
the right circumstances,
 so that perhaps we needn't 
wait for them to 
occur by good fortune.
'
 
49
 Psilocybin,
 even in moderate doses of 3 to 
4 grams,
 tends to dissolve our attachment to deficiency needs
.
 
Maslow 
chose the term 
'p eak- experiences'
 to remove the religious connotations,
 
so that it was understood that anyone could achieve these egoless 
moments of self-transcendence.
Self-transcendence occurs at higher states of consciousness,
 
when w
e are no longer violently battered by our mind'
s anxieties,
 
preoccupa
tions,
 f
ears and impulse
s
.
 
Instead,
 the self becomes small and 
the sense of connection to a cause,
 an idea or a collective that
'
s bigger 
than ourselv
es arises.
 
I
t '
s a liberation
.
 
In moments of self-transcendence, 
we realise that we aren'
t lonely fragments floating through time, but that 
we are all expressions of nature, c
onnected with and to each other by 
spirit.
 
'
W
e do not "
come into"
 this world,
'
 
said Alan W
at ts, ' we come 
out of it,
 
as leaves from a tree.
 As  the ocean 
" waves "
,
 
the universe 
"people s "
.
 
Every individual is an expression of the whole realm of 
nature,
 a unique action of the total universe.
 This fact is rarely
,
 
if ever
,
 
experienced by most individuals.
 Even those w
ho know it to be true  
in theory do not sense or feel it, 
but continue to be a
ware of themselv
es 
as isolated "
egos" inside bags of skin.

Is there an innate compass guiding us? Whatever the answers to the 
mysteries are, 
we have been endowed with the ability to make sense  
of them.
 It is up to you to explore it.
 
The world is awakening to a new consciousness,
 and psychedelics 
are playing a vital role
.
 
Most cultures throughout history ha
ve had 
intimate relationships with psychedelics to alter their consciousness.
 
Fungi remind us that we are stewards of our consciousness and of the 
planet.
 It is from this place of connection that we can begin to heal.
 
This is how shamans ha

Psychedelics guided them, and psychedelics can guide us too.

Arguably the most iconic and recognisable mushroom species,
 
muscaria
 is a brilliant red or orange mushroom with white patches. 
The spots are remnants of the white veil that enclosed the mushroom 
when it was young. Its common name is 
'fly
 agaric' because it was 
traditionally used to attract and kill flies.
 The cap was crushed in a 
saucer of milk and set as a trap on windowsills.
 It is widely represented 
in popular culture,
 including appearances in 
Super Mario Bros.

Many myths and legends surround the use of 
A. muscaria
of years, i
t has been used as an entheogen in religious contexts to reach 
trance-like states. 
However
,
 there is a fine line between psychoactive 
and toxic
.
 
In larger doses,
 it can cause sweating, 
twitching,
 nausea 
and diarrhoea.
 Boiling and drying can decrease the toxicity without 
compromising the psychoactive effects
.
 
Another (
riskier)  method 
involves
using the human liver to filter out the toxins. Th
is is commonly 
practised by Siberian shamans 
- t
hey ingest the mushrooms so that 
their livers filter out the toxins,
 leaving the psychoactive compounds  
in their urine for others to consume.

 Its cap is golden-brown with white flecks and 
has a tendency to stain blue when touched.
 The mushroom behind  
the magic is a dung-loving species that sta
ys close to grazing cattle. 
 
It consumes the nutrients in the dung and creates the sporing body  
to release spores that in turn germinate in other dung piles.

There is currently no widely acc epted understanding of where  
P

cyanescens
 originated. It seems to prefer artificial areas,
 g rowing 
abundantly on mulch beds and wood chips. 
One theor y is that its spores 
hitchhiked into a wood chip supply centre and colonised the mulch that 
is distributed at a commercial scale to control we eds.
 This explains the 
frequent massive harvests of 
P

 in public places.

Psilocybe mexicana
 is a small,
 wispy mushroom that grows to a height 
of 12 centimetres
.
 
It has a bel l - s haped,
 straw- c oloured cap. I t is legal in 
the Netherlands through a loophole that allows its sclerotia to be sold 
as ' magic truffles'
.
 
The sclerotia form as hardened masses of mycelium 
in response to harsh conditions such as drought or lack of nutrients.
 
Depending on the substrate, s
clerotia contains roughly half the 
psilocybin and psilocin content of dried mushro oms. Sclerotia tastes 
similar to pungent psilocybin mushrooms,
 but has the distinct texture 
of walnuts.

Widely known as 
' liberty cap'
,
 
Psilocybe semilanceata
 was the first 
European species confirmed to contain psilocybin in the 1960s.
 
Semilanceata
 means '
sp ear-shaped'
 in Latin,
 referring to its pointed,
 
conical cap perched on a long thin stipe. It looks small and fragile even 
among blades of grass,
 but it is one of the most potent psychedelic 
mushrooms in the world. It can also f
orm sclerotia,
 the dormant for m 
of the fungus,
 to weather natural disasters. The high concentration of 
psilocybin makes the experience extremely visual and it can last longer 
than that induced by other species.

semilanceata
 is an iconic species in Europe. I
ts common name stems 
from a 4th-c entury tradition in the R
oman Empire,
 w
hen a 
' liberty 
cap' 
made of soft f
elt was given to freed slaves to symbolise their new 
status in society
.
 
Liberty caps were political symbols in the French and 
American revolutions in the 18th century
,
 
and they were placed on a 
pole to symbolise rebellion.
 Fittingly
,
 
P
.
 
semilanceata
 is also the symbol 
of an inner revolution today

It'
s
no 
secret 
that
when 
it 
comes 
to
the 
natural 
world, 
we 
take 
far 
more 
than 
we
give 
back.
 
Far 
from 
our 
humble 
beginnings 
living 
in 
harmony 
with 
the
land 
and 
the 
ocean, 
we 
have 
now 
harnessed 
the 
power 
of 
the 
human 
collective to organise ourselves into magnificent
cities and 
cultures.
While 
our 
ancestors 
were 
striking 
flint 
to 
start 
a 
fire, 
we 
now
can 
create 
nuclear 
fusion,
 
the 
very
process 
that 
powers 
our 
sun 
and 
the 
stars.
By 
most 
measures,
we 
have 
performed 
unimaginably 
well.
 
Y
e
t 
from 
nature'
s
perspective, 
we 
have 
been 
swept 
up 
by 
the 
impressive 
velocity
of 
this 
advancement 
and 
outpaced 
the 
steady
rhythm of her dance.
W
e
have forgotten that nature is not 
a part of our world, but that we are a part of nature.
Y
o

probably 
don't
walk 
around 
appreciating 
the 
impossibility 
of 
life
in 
the 
vast 
expanse 
of 
our 
universe.
But 
our temporary lease here on Earth
is just that,
ephemeral.
Our 
modern 
civilisation,
steeped 
in 
culture, 
technology
and beliefs,
represents 
a 
mere 0.0000 2   pe r   cent 
of 
Earth'
s
4.5 billion-year 
history
.
 
Our 
fleeting 
existence 
should 
be 
in 
reverence to the processes our planet has been undergoing 
for 
billions
of 
years 
-
processes 
that 
will 
continue 
long 
after 
we 
are
gone.
Instead,
we 
are 
in 
competition 
with 
natural systems and outcompeting them.
At 
the 
First 
W

Climate 
Conference 
in 
1979,
scientists 
from
fifty 
countries
acknowledged 
that 
the 
alarming

it 
urgently

Earth

a 
closed-loop 
system. 
All 
physical 
matter 
exists in fixed and limited amounts. What
we have is what 
we've 
got 
-
forever
.
For 
life 
on 
Earth 
to
continue, 
matter 
must 
be 
recycled 
over 
and 
over 
again.
Nature 
is 
circular -
 
when 
a 
plant 
dies,
the 
nutrients 
are
fed
back 
into 
the 
soil 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the

O ur 
current 
supply 
chain 
and 
consumption habits are linear
. T he end of the 'take-make-
u s e - dispose' model is landfill.
There 
is 
no

that 
the 
industries 
of 
the 
future 
will choose to implement design principles that underpin 
a 
circular 
economy

It'
s
happening 
now

These 
principles

keeping

in

designing

partnering 
with

to 
minimise 
environmental pollution.
Luckily 
for 
us,
there'

a 
natural 
kingdom 
with 
a
billion years of experience
ready and waiting to share.
But 
can 
we 
slow 
down
enough 
to 
learn
the 
lessons 
it 
has 
to 
teach 
us? 
W
o
rking 
hard 
in 
the 
shadows, 
fungi 
are 
critical 
to 
the 
natural 
processes 
we
take

Pioneers 
in 
the 
field 
of 
science,
biotechnolog y 
and

are 
recognising 
their 
power 
to 
help 
solve
our 
problems. 
Astounding applications of fungi - from removing toxins

pollutants 
in

(
mycorestoration)
to 
transforming

into 
useful 
materials

Fungi have a range of natural abilities that we can use to heal damaged 
habitats.
 This is known as mycorestoration. 
Scientists can leverage 
fungi'
s ability to decompose,
 and engineer it to break down pollutants 
in the environment,
 particularly xenobiotics.
 X
enobiotics are chemical 
substances that have been introduced by humans and do not exist in 
nature,
 such as pesticides, 
cosmetics,
 industrial chemicals and drugs.
 
The discovery of white rot fungi has propelled the study of 
mycorestoration. White rot fungi is a group of saprophytic fungi 
that has the unique ability to break down xenobiotics.
 M
ycorrhizal 
and parasitic fungi also play a role in mycorestoration, 
as they can 
accumulate and degrade toxic metals.

of the water on Earth is accessible and fit for consumption,
 and this is 
currently shared betwe en households, 
agriculture and industry
.
 
Over 
97 per cent of Earth'
s water is too salty and 2 per cent is freshwater 
locked away in groundwater
, g
laciers and ice caps.
2
In the last 100 years,
 the world'
s population grew f
ourf
old as 
the world'
s water consumption grew sixf
old.
 The industrial age and 
modern plumbing have made wa
y for water consumption at rates that 
were never possible bef
ore.
 This efficiency
,
 
coupled with an increase in 
demand for water
, h
as resulted in global scarcity
.
Flushing the toilet or running the washing machine creates 
wastewater that is not reusable until it is treated. Roughly 80 per cent 
of the world'
s wastewater is left untreated and allowed back into our 
waterwa
ys, 
putting the health of our water ecosystems at risk.
3
 Even in 
develope d countries,
 wastewater is not properly dec ontaminated due to 
outdated treatment plants, sewage overflows and ineffe ctive household 
sewage treatment systems.
 The source of untreated wastewater is 
difficult to pinpoint,
 as it originates from a range of sources,
 w
hich 
often include agricultural and stor mwater run-off
.
A promising example of an aff
ordable and feasible solution is 
mycofiltration.
 This process uses fungal mycelium as a biological  
filter to capture and remove contaminants from water and soil. 
Depending on the fungal species,
 mycelium can even eat through and 
digest pollutants such as pesticides,
 mercury and petroleum products
.
 
If you peer at fungi through a microscope,
 you'l l see that the cells of 
mycelium are about 0
. 5 -
2 microns wide (for c omparison, a strand of 
human hair is 50 microns wide). Mycelium grows as interconnected 
cells that resemble a netted fabric.
Armed with this knowled ge in the 1970s, P aul Stamets imagined 
that this fabric of interconnecte d cells could become a biological filter
.
 
He tested this hypothesis on his waterfront farm, installing large sacks 
filled with substrate inoculated with mycelium of the garden giant 
species (
Stropharia rugosoannulata
) around water basins.
 The sacks 
forme d a netted barrier to catch contaminants as water passed through. 
This mycofilter cleansed the water
, r
esulting in a 100-fold drop in 
coliform levels -
 the bacteria that is present in the digestive tracts of 
animals and found in their waste
.
 
The mycofilter successfully reduced 
fecal matter in the water
, a
lleviating the downstream impacts of  
contaminated water
.
 
T
his finding was later investigated and confirmed 
by the US  Environmental Protection Agency (EP
A ).
A myc ofilter can be as simple as a hessian burlap sack filled 
with wet straw and wood chips, 
and inoculated with mycelium.
 
It is inexpensive and simple to set up
.
 
Also, t
he small size of the 
mycofilter means that it has minimal impact on ecology and can be 
installed around sites such as farms,
 urban areas,
 roads and factories. 
Having a mycofiltration system in these areas can help decontaminate 
wastewater before it makes its way back into our waterways.
Mycelium is known for its insatiable hunger for organic matter

Forests cover one-third of the land on Earth and their diverse habitats

 As  for  humans,
 billions of people in rural communities rely 
on forests f

.
 
Forests are also a vital 
player in the effort against climate change as they act as a carbon sink 
- t
hey absorb, o r sequester
, l
arge amounts of carbon dioxide and store 
the carbon in their wood.
 Old-growth forests are particularly critical,

This releases

then inoculate d with nat ive saprophytic fungi species to speed up  
the decomposition process. 
This redirects vital elements and nutrients 
back into the soil for use by the rest of the forest.
 Fungi also produce 
glomalin at the hyphal tips,
 w
hich is what fungi use to store carbon. 
It'
s a sticky substance that binds together soil particles and builds soil 
architecture
.
 
This aerates the soil,
 helps water and nutrient retention,
 
and regenerates impacted habitats.
Along with f
orests and oceans,
 soils also act as an invaluable 
carbon sink.
 R
esearch found that mycorrhizal fungi in boreal forest 
islands in Swe den hold up to 70 per cent of the total carbon stored in 
soils.
5
 This means that trees connected to a mycelial network absorb 
carbon from the atmosphere and then transfer it into the mycelium  
for storage.

 Fungi play a critical role in regulating the global climate.
Mycoforestry was put into action in Colorado by Jeff Ravage, 
North Fork

a
tershed coordinator for  the Coalition for  the Upper 
South Platte and researcher at Denver Botanic Gardens.

 Many scientists

 the use of fungi to de contaminate the 
environment. After all, fungi are nature'

has been effective f
or Earth for over a billion years.
In forests,
 a major source of nutrients is from fallen trees,
  
released as the trees break do

 Another diesel spill was

 But convincing landowners 
to try mycoremediation is challenging.

 There is strong interest from manufacturers in these industries

flexible,
 durable yet easy and cheap to produce.
 
T
he manufacture of  
the wide-ranging plastics family begins by drilling for crude oil. The  
oil is then heated to form chains of carbon called plastic polymers.
In 2017
,
 
a global analysis of all plastics ever made showed that 
6.6 billion tonnes,
 or 79 per cent,
 
has accumulated as waste in the 
environment, 12 per cent has been burned and only 9 per cent has been 
recycled .

burned,
 w
hich is energy-intensive and emits harmful pollutants into the 
environment. 
So far
,
 
t
he only green way to decom
pose plastic is through 
photodegradation,
 w
hich uses UV rays f rom sunlight to break apart 
the plastic molecules.
 U
nfor
tunately
,
 
since waste in landfills rarely sees 
the light of day
,
 
it can take up to a thousand years to decom
pose.
 These 
materials do not exist in na
ture, 
so nature'
s organisms hav
e not ev
olved  
the ability to break them down eff
ectively
,
 
if at all.
 That is,
 until recent 
discoveries of particular fungal species tha
t show an appetite for plastic.
In 2017
,
 
scientists from the Ku nming Institute of Botany in China 
discovered a microfungi,
 
Aspergillus tubing
ensis
,
 
i
n a Pakistani rubbish 
tip that can break down polyurethane.
13
 The fungus secretes enzymes 
that break apart the bonds betw
een the plastic molecules,
 allowing it to 
ingest the plastic as fo od.
 The fungus also uses the ph
ysical strength of 
its myc elia to help break apart the molecules,
 
m
aking the decom
position 
process as short as a f
ew w
eeks. 
The team,
 led by Dr Sehroon Khan, has 
since found fifty other strains of fungi that can break do
wn other types 
of plastic and is working on finding the optimal environment for these 
fungi to thrive.
 
T
he only ca
tch is that funding is limited.
 Finding  
a fungus that can break down plastic in a petri dish is vastly diffe rent  
to deploy ing it at a commercial level in landfills.
Another solution is to design plastics that can be biodegraded 
using bacteria and fungi.
 This reduces not only plastic pollution but 
also our society
'
s reliance on crude oil to synthesise plastics.

A pest is any organism that causes destruction and spreads disease.
  
T h e  F o o d  a n d  A g r i c u l t u r e  O r g anisation  o f  t h e  U n ited Nations 
estimates that 20 to 40 per cent of global crop production is lost to 
pests each year
, c
osting the global economy around US$220 billion.
Common prevalent pests include insects, w eeds and microbial 
pathogens,
 w

 livestock and building structures.
In 2019,
 the global pesticides industry was worth US$84.5 billion,
 
largely made up of synthetic chemical products that help farmers 
control or kill these pests.
15
 These synthetic solutions are effe ctive,
 
but they have the same problem as antibiotics 
-  overuse encourages 
resistance,
 increasing a pest'
s tolerance to pesticide exposure.
 This  
cycle requires progressively more chemicals to reach the same level  
of effectiveness, r

poisoning ecosystems.

environment. Biopesticides are defined by the EP

as ' pesticides

 bacteria and 
certain minerals '
.
17
 One promising solution is mycopesticides,
 a 
biopesticide using the green mould fungus 
Metarhizium anisopliae
  
as the active ingredient.
 This fungus is an entomopathogenic species 
-
 
 
a parasitic fungus that fe eds on insects and other pests.
 As  insects come 
into contact with the entomopathogenic fungi,
 the fungal spores attach 
themselves onto the insect, grow inside their body and feed on their 
organs until they are paralysed or dead.
Fungi in biopesticides can be trained through selective breeding 
to tell the diff
erence between 
'go
od' and '
bad' i
nsects so that they don'
t 
disrupt butterflies,
 p ollinators and other b eneficial insects.
 Compared 
to chemical pesticides -
 95 per cent of which do not hit their target 
-
18
  
fungal biopesticides have a lower impact on the environment,
 are not 
harmful to humans or other animals,
 and are also considered safe for  
organic farming.
 R
esearchers are rushing towards commercialising 
new applications of this fungal innovation.
 A n otable philosophy from 
leaders in the field is to not wage war against the insect kingdom but  
to enlist fungal def
ences when pests threaten people

economies or  
the environment. The aim is to seek balance,
 not extinction.

 movement called permaculture.
Permaculture is a departure from traditional agricultural 
practices that was started in the 1970s by 
A
u
stralians Bill Mol lison 
and David Holmgren. It is underpinned by a set of planning and design 
principles that are inspired by nature.
 The basics of permaculture 
involve restoring soil, 
conserving water

year-long food crops.

self-sufficient systems

. I
t is a f

decouples the grower from the existing industrial fo od system and its 
extensive environmental impacts.
 Permaculture creates self-sufficiency
,
 
regeneration and interconnectedness that is not limited to foo d and can 
be applied to all aspects of life. M ollison and Holmgren hoped that it 
would bec ome the 
'permanent culture'
 of  how we think and live.
The influence of permaculture is growing and runs deep through

and medicinal mushrooms for you and your family
,

The products used to maintain the develope d world'
s standard of 
living,
 from home decor to electronics, 
are all created from Earth'
s 
raw materials.
 These materials undergo industrial processes that incur 
massive hidden costs that escap e the colle ctive a
wareness
.
 
For example,
 
the most commonly used structural materials 
- c
oncrete,
 steel and 
aluminium 
- c
ontribute more than 22 per cent of global carbon dioxide 
emissions.
 As  for the fast fashion world of $10 t- shirts,
 producing 
1 kilogram of cotton in India 
- where most cotton is grown -
  
consumes 22,500 litres of water
, w
ith no opportunity for reuse.
19
Instead,
 the future can be grown. Designers interested in the 
future of materials are innovators. 
They are taking inspiration from 
nature'
s design systems and manifesting a reality based on a circular 
economy of materials.
 Rather than using up finite resources such 
as fossil fuels,
 land and animals to meet our needs for materials, 
we can grow them through partnerships with living organisms.
 
Inevitably
,
 
industrial manufacturing will be replaced with biological 
manufacturing.
 Materials will be grown,
 fabricated ,
 
used and,
 at  
the end of their lif
ecycle, 
biodegraded or reused 
- c losing the loop  
of the circular
economy
.
The ever-adaptable mycelium has become a core building 
block for the new biological materials revolution,
 also referred to as 
mycodesign and mycofabrication. Using mycelium,
 fungi can transform 
a range of organic and inorganic waste into high-perfor ming materials 
of almost any shape,
 strength and densit y
.
 
The process is energy-
 and 
resource- efficient.
 M
yco design and mycofabrication f
orm a new class 
of materials and products that meet a far superior level of sustainability 
compared to traditional products and their manufacturing methods.
The processes to create mycelium materials are complex, but 
here is a simplified version.
 
T
o
 begin,
 substrates can be prepared using 
different types of organic waste, such as cor n cobs,
 egg cartons or 
agricultural waste. 
The waste is inoculated with spores of fungal strains 
that have been selected for their growth speed and compatibility with 
the substrate
.
 
From there the myc elium grows quickly
,
 
weaving and 
intertwining itself through the substrate. As the myc elium grows
,
 
it 
acts as a natural glue that holds the substrate together
,
 
self-assembling 
into the shap e of whatever container it sits in.
 The starting materials 
conver t into advanced biomaterials in less than two weeks.
 The new 
material is then removed from the container and dried at the right 
temperature and humidity
.
 
These images show three stages 
 
of myc elial growth in hemp mulch: 
T
o
p
 layer: The mulch is inoculated 
 
Middle layer: Mycelium consumes 
the mulch over t welve weeks.
Bottom layer: Mycelium completes 
colonisation and assumes the 
dimensions of the container

At the end of the material'

Architecture is both a science and an art,
 
involving design,
 planning 
and construction. As we marvel over structures,
 such as the Metropol 
Parasol in Spain designed by German architect Jürgen Hermann Maye
r
,
 
we forget the vast amounts of time,
 energy and resources they took 
to create.
 The Metropol Parasol consists of six parasols in the form 
of giant mushro oms and it is one of the largest wooden structures in 
the world. If we hope to maintain today
'
s quality of lif

,
 
we will need 
to challenge the current ways we manufacture,

Engineered wo od is one of the most common building materials.
 
It is an all-rounder that is versatile and a
vailable in a variety of 
strengths,
 thicknesses,
 sizes and durabilit y
.
 
But the production of 
engineered wo od presents an array of problems.
 
T
o
 obtain wood,
 
natural f
orests are logged.
 D eforestation contributes 15 per cent of 
global greenhouse gas emissions each year
.
21
 Engineered wo od only 
consists of 85 per cent natural wood.
 The remaining 15 per cent is 
made up of toxic resins derived from fossil fuels.
 These resins are 
binding agents and they release a gas called formaldehyde, 
a known 
human carcinogen.
 Another building material culprit is polyurethane.
 
This is plastic f
oam made from crude oil that is used in wall insulation.
 
Three million tonnes of it is produced in the US each year
,
 of which 
80 per cent ends up in landfills and 20 per cent ends up in waterways.
What if architecture could grow
,
 
decay and then grow again? 
Researchers in the mycofabrication field have transf
orme d myc elium 
into organic materials f
or use in different construction applications.
 
Mycelium can be engineered to match the strength of alternative 
materials and has properties that make it non-toxic and resistant

 The top layer coating

 Maurizio Montalti, co-founder of Mogu, says

of a single Mogu floor tile, s
urpasses the technical performances 
offered by traditional engineered woods,
'
 and emphasises,

22
 Mogu proves that it is possible to be responsible 
without compromising technical perf
ormance and luxurious design 
aesthetics,
 w
hile still minimising one'

Mogu'
s ethos is to develop and design products in line with the 
principles of a circular economy
.
 
Mogu strives to use and transform 
raw materials that come as cast-offs from other industrial processes 
and value chains. M ontalti prefers to not use the word '
waste'
 
-
 
h
e says 
'waste is a man-made notion that should b e obsolete,
 b ecause waste 
does not exist at all in nature.
'
 
He pref
ers instead to describe them as 
'low-value residual matters'
 that can be upcycled .
23
Mogu is also designing a process f
or their floor tiles to be 
reclaimed and recycled at the end of the product'
s life.
 
T
he myc elium-
composite core will be separated from the bio-based resin, then ground 
down and up cycled to create new floor tiles. Acc
ordingly
,
 
Mogu has 
earned a Blue Angel ecolabel certification for their floor tiles,
 w
hich 
confirms that they are low in emissions and pol lutants and have no 
adverse impact on the environment.
UK biomanufacturing company Biohm has developed a fungal 
insulation panel to solve the polyurethane issue. Founder Ehab 
Saye d explains that they start with a waste stream and f
e e d it to the 
mycelium. Once the mycelium creates the desired material, they use 
heat or dehydration to cure it.
 Curing breaks down the cell walls of the 
fungus,
 w
hich deactivates the living organism and makes it ready for 
installation. 
This natural process does not include any chemicals or 
additives and takes thirty to fifty days from waste processing to deliver 
the product,
 depending on the aggressiveness of the species
.
 
Sayed calls 
this 'matchmaking' 
- m arrying a perfe ct substrate with a perf
ect fungal 
strain creates a perfe ct material f
or a specific application.
Described as 'mushroom insulation'
,
 
Biohm'
s fungal insulation 
panels have outperfor med alternatives on the market across a range 
of properties.
 Early tests show that fungal insulation can ke ep you 
warmer
, o
utperforming alternatives by two to three times based on 
its thermal conductivity rating.
 Its fire perf
ormance is superior
,
 
as 
there are no synthetic chemicals,
 and, on average,
 it halves the spread 
of fire in a building.
 Its volatile organic compounds also achieve d an 
A
+
 
rating,
 w
hich means it releases zero airborne toxins and increases 
indoor air quality
,
 
making it one of the healthiest insulation materials 
on the market.

So if it '

it will remain perf

I think it'
s a misconception that often stops bio-based 
materials from advancing.
'
24
Sayed'
s
 philosophy is to allow nature to lead innovation and 
make sure everything Biohm touches has a positive or regenerative 
impact.
 This is echoed throughout their processes,
 from embedding the 
principles of the circular economy to working with local communities 
to scale their pro duction faci lities.
 These communit y  f a c i l i t i e s are a 
one-stop shop for 
processing waste and producing mycelium insulation 
panels 
- t
hey are even offered a 50 per cent profit share on every 
product they sell. 
Biohm'
s fungal insulation panels are currently priced on par with 
premium synthetics but they are hoping to be comp etitive at the lower 
end of the market as they scale up their operation. They want their 
product to be accessible f
or p eople in social housing,
 w
hose homes 
tend to be less well built or maintained and who therefore need it most.
 
Sayed offers a gentle reminder about the intricacies of working with 
mycelium. It releases carbon dioxide as it grows
,
 
so it'
s impor tant to 
build in processes that can capture the carbon pro duced.
Mycoarchitecture does not stop at the boundaries of our planet.
 
When humans become a multi-planetary species,
 new architectural 
design and production principles will need to be created and applied 
in space.
 In 2017
,
 
the European Space A gency
,
 
with Utrecht University 
and Officina Corpuscoli (
a design-research studio run by Maurizio 
Montalti),
 c onducted a feasibility research project to explore the 
opportunities for growing fungal structures on new planetary surfaces,
 
such as Mars and the Moon,
 to create new habitats.
25
 Results show 
that the growth of biocomposite materials involving the fungal 
species 
Schizoph
yllum commune
 was successful in extreme conditions 
of micrograv i t y
,
 
macrograv i t y
,
 
temperat u re  an d  ra di at ion, such as 
cosmic gamma radiatio
n
.
 
This early research shows that fungi can be 
successfully leveraged to create building materials, 
but much more 
multidisciplinary work needs to be done before myc elium materials  
can reliably surpass the perf
ormance of conventional building 
materials,
 such as concrete.
A paradigm shift is occurring as more and more companies 
participate in the circular ec onomy
.
 
The definition of waste is being 
rewritten as we work with fungi to create new bio-based materials.
 An 
increasing awareness of these materials and their potential applications 
allows us to design 
with
 nature rather than against it. What '
s more 
exciting is that fungi is at the centre of this.
 The pioneers believe that 
we haven't
 even scratched the surface of its potential applications.

Ecovative has been expanding their operations since

It'
s an exciting time to join the biotechnolog y revolution and 
transition into a circular future.
 This is still a young field and change 
doesn't happen overnight. Few companies have cemented partnerships 
with brands and built new supply chains to bring products to the 
market.
 
Commercialisation is the second hill to climb after product 
development. 
Luckily
,
 
the fashion and textiles industry thrives on  
a quick pace and conscious consumers are waiting for fashion to  
go fungal.
 At 
the end of the da
y
,
 the consumer makes the rules by 
choosing what to buy
,
 
so ethical fashion starts with all of us.

The need for packaging arose when production and consumption took 
place at diffe rent locations.
 
W
i
t
h the increasing rate of urbanisation, 
packaging is used more than ev
er
.
 
T oda
y
,
 
40 per cent of the plastic 
produced f
or packaging is used onc
e
,
 
then discarded.
26
 In the fo od 
industry
,
 
the goal is to prolong the shelf lif
e of foo d to minimise food 
waste, 
which is indeed a global issue.
 But how can plastic,
 with a useful 
life of a few days
,
 
be used in such quantities when it takes hundreds of 
years to break down?
It'
s not just plastic and it'
s not just the fo od industry
.
 
Packaging 
is everyw
here.
 The traditional shopkeeper in the marketplace has 
been replace d with packaging, taking on the functions of protection,
 
distribution,
 
education and marketing.
 
T
o
 the consumer
, p
roduct 
quality is not only deter mined by the product itself,
 but also by the 
packaging.
 U ltimately
,
 
the purpose of packaging is transient.
 
W
e
 need 
a solution that is easily manufactured,
 effective during its lifetime and 
then easily reused or biodegraded.
 R
ecycling should be a last resort.
 
Plastic can only be recycled nine times at most and each recycling loop 
requires energy
.
At the crux of all this,
 the challenges faced by alternative packing 
materials revolve around four themes: sustainability
,
 
strength,
 design 
and cost.
 A c lear research and development leader in the mycelium 
packaging space is Ecovative,
 w
hose M
yco Composite technology grows 
mycelium in a mould to create a custom structure called Mushroom 
Packaging.
 Co-founder and CE O  E b e n Bayer describes the action  
as '5 per cent mycelium pulling together 95 per cent wood chi p s '
.
The mycelium acts as a natural glue,
 f
orming strong,
 sturdy materials 
that can hold products safely and securely in transit.
Up to a threshold of a fe w hundred thousand units per year
,
 
manufacturing my
celium packaging is much faster and more cost-
effec tive than plastic.
 I
t uses less energy and produces up to 90 per cent 
fewer  carbon emission

With the triple threats of climate change,
 resource depletion and 
waste build-up, w e must radically transform how we interact with 
nature.
 Fungi are catalysts for change. Their natural design principles 
and manufacturing capabilities are being engineered to create the 
upcoming biotechnolog y revolution.
Using minimal energ y
,
 
fungi can be engineered to produce  
high-performing materials with precision.
 
A
t
o
m by atom, we can  
create a new class of sustainable materials, 
much like a biological  
3D printer
.
 
T
his is a part of the 
'nature co- desi gn' biotechnology  
revolution advo cated by Massimo Portincaso,
 a partner at Boston 
Consulting Group who co-leads the Deep T
e ch practice.
 In the paper 
Nature  Co-Design: 
A  R
evolution in the Making
, h
e refers to nature  
c o - d esign as the next wave of innovation,
 
' w
here biology
,
 
material 
science and nanotechnology meet to leverage nature'
s design principles 
and manufacturing capabilities at the atomic level'
.
 
This frees us from 
our reliance on extracting raw materials f
or energy and products and 
allows us to use the inherent manufacturing capabilities of living 
organisms. Th e paper ref
ers to this biotechnology revolution as the 
fourth industrial revolution,
 after coal,
 electricity and the internet,
 
with the potential to disrupt every industry in ever y economy
,
 
and a 
total market opportunity of US$30 trillion over the next thirty years.
29
W

are moving to
wards a collective fungal consciousness that 
recognises the wisdom and potential of fungi.
 The future is bright when 
we have great minds designing our future in partnership with nature.

With 75 per cent of human perceptions based on vision,
 
we 
commonly neglect the things that are invisible to the naked eye.  
But with each loss of a fungal species, w e lose more of nature'

Energy is not lost,
 it is transformed.
 Fungi lead this essential process. 
Fungi 
are the organisms that primarily decompose matter to enable recomp osition,
 that 
chemically hack systems to produce changes that enable the continuation of lif
e
.
 
As if that is not enough,
 they also assist the lif
e of plants and animals through 
essential symbioses that enable the existence of the ecosystem.
 They build 
- a
nd 
burn -
 the bridges of  life.
However
, f
ungi are not exempt from threats to their wellbeing.
 They are as 
affected by climate change, 
habitat loss and fragmentation, nitrogen enrichment 
and use of fungicides as plants and animals.
 H
uman impacts lead to species loss 
in Kingdom 
Fungi
. I
t is estimated that we ha
ve only identified 10 per cent of all 
fungal species,
 so it is highly likely that we are losing species of fungi that we 
didn't even know existe d .
What can we do? Conserving fungal habitats is the key
,
 
because fungi are 
not separate from their symbionts. They exemplify the interconnectedness of 
life.
 For the most part,
 they are specific to their substrates, 
making every species 
of plant and animal an ecosystem in their own right. T
o
 make sure the pine 
mushroom thrives in nature, we must make sure the pine tree thrives.
 
T
o
 make 
sure the caterpillar fungus thrives,
 we must ensure the life cycle of the moth.
 
Fungi demonstrate that we are not independent of others.
Unfortunately
,
 
in the eyes of most governments, i
f there is nothing under 
threat,
 there is nothing to protect.
 
T
o
 ensure the legal protection of fungi,
 
we have to make the case that they 
need
 protection.
 
This process has been 
challenging,
 b ecause fungi are explicitly excluded from policy frameworks 
because they are neither flora nor faun a .
 Rather
, t
hey are funga 
- a
 term that 
accounts f
or the fungal diversity of a given place. 
The acknowledgement of their existence in language has been the fo cus 
o f  t h e  F u n g i  Foundat ion, w h o  s t a r te d  b y  fo r m a l l y  d e f i n i n g  t h e  te r m ,

and 
t h e n  t e a m i n g  w i t h  c on s e r v at i o n  or g a n i s at i o n s  to  h e l p  t h e m  t r a n s ition to 
'mycologically inclusive language'
.
 
This 3F approach 
- f
auna,
 flora,
 funga -
 
is leading the wa
y for the formal recognition of fungi in conservation 
frameworks. 
It is up to all of us to sa
y it:
 'fu
nga'
 means 'the diversity of fungi  
in a given place'
.
This is all about recognising fungal protection as a vehicle for habitat 
protection.
 If we move towards implementing the 3F approach, the formal 
inclusion of fungi in conservation frameworks will help ensure an ecosystemic 
approach to conservation.
 This movement will positively impact the research,
 
funding and political opp ortunities of fungi and mycology and advance the 
knowle dge and protection of wider habitats.
Also,
 of course,
 we must 
'rot on'
,
 
letting the cycle of lif
e reach 
decomp osition by fungi,
 so all is recomposed.

usefulness in mycoremediation.
 Its genome was sequenced in 2017 to

It took
fungi to wake
us up to the natural world. True healing - of  
ourselves
and 
the 
planet 
- 
can 
only 
occur 
by 
dissolving 
the 
walls 
that we
erect 
and 
the 
labels 
we 
attach 
ourselves 
to. The 
belief 
that 
demarcates 
our 
physical 
bodies 
from 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
world 
is 
an 
illusion.
Fungi show
us this.
They form intimate and indispensable 
relationships 
with 
all 
forms
of 
life, 
permeating 
and
suppor ting 
every 
ecosystem 
on 
Earth. 
Our 
planet 
as 
we 
know
it 
would 
not 
exist without fungi.
The kingdom of fungi radically
challenges the 
concept of the individual.
 
As we journey through our one precious life, 
we are intimately 
intertwined 
with 
all 
life
forms. Far 
from
being 
separate 
from 
nature, 
we are an amalgamation of genes that have been mixing,
mutating 
and transferring for billions of years.
Each of us is an expression
of 
life,
 to be explored and cherished.
W
e
 
have
been endowed with consciousness. W
e
recognise this 
existence 
and 
our 
responsibility 
as 
stewards 
of 
our 
planet.
There 
is so much that
divides the world -
changing it hinges
on changing 
the 
way 
we 
perceive 
our 
place 
and 
purpose 
in 
it.
T
o
some,
mould 
growing 
on 
milk 
is 
a 
nuisance; 
to 
others,
it 
is 
an 
opportunity 
to 
produce 
cheese. 
Fungi 
can 
offer 
endless 
solutions 
to 
our 
physical, 
mental 
and 
spiritual 
crises.
If 
we 
can 
change 
our 
mind 
about 
a 
fungus,
 imagine what else we can change. 
Mycology 
needs 
more 
scientists.
More 
funding. 
M
ore 
activism. 
More protection. More people celebrating fungi through different 
mediums.
The 
next
time 
you 
eat 
mushrooms, 
drink 
wine 
or 
take 
a 
walk 
through 
the 
forest,
give 
a 
moment 
of 
gratitude 
to 
this 
humble kingdom.
This is only the beginning of our
existential awakening.
Fungi 
is just
one of many thrilling
explorations. S cience,
philosophy
,
 
art,
mathematics 
and 
many 
more 
disciplines 
offer 
new 
dimensions 
of 
mental models for us to understand and appreciate the macrocosm. 
W
e
 
have
eyes 
to 
take 
in 
sights, 
noses 
to 
take
in 
scents 
and 
bodies 
to deeply
immerse into nature. Go out and experience the wonder 
for yourself

This 
is 
a 
chance 
to 
raise 
our 
consciousness 
and 
it'
s
in 
the 
pursuit of these greater goals that
the human spirit shines through. 
When 
a 
flash 
of 
iridescent 
knowing 
arises,
follow 
it.
These 
inquiries 
change 
you. 
They 
should 
change 
you.
 
W
e
are 
capable 
of 
so 
much 
more connection,
 empathy and creativit y
.
 
May 
we
loosen 
our 
grip 
on 
dogmas, 
question 
our 
old 
assumptions 
and 
embrace 
new 
ideas. May 
we 
consume 
consciously
,
 
give generously
,
 
choose love over fear and have fun along the way
.
 
W
e
 
are travellers on a cosmic trip.
 
It 
is 
a 
pleasure 
to 
have 
encountered,
loved 
and 
shared 
this 
time 
in space with you.

A U T H O R S
Beginning his career building technology and consumer startu
p
s
,
 
Sydney-born 
MICHAEL 
LIM
 co-founded an online eyew
ear brand at the 
age of twenty-on
e
,
 
which is now one of A
ustralia'
s largest ey
ewear 
chains.
However
,
 
early t ransformational experiences with psychedelics 
inspired his fascination with the fungi kingdom and prompted a career 
change. He now dedicates his time to researching fungi,
 psychedelics, 
ecology and anthropology
.
 
His exploration of the psyche and how 
nature gives rise to altered states of consciousness has led him on 
a path of self-enquiry and towards the integ ration of his shift in 
worldviews
.
 
Through his writing,
 Michael seeks to empower a deeper 
understanding of the human experience through art and science.
A gifted researcher
,
 
YUN SHU
 is dedicated to the study of consciousness 
and uses language and culture as tools fo r connection and healing.
  
Born in Shanghai
,
 
she was exposed to the benefits of traditional Chinese 
medicine and fungi from a young a
g
e
.
 
After a successful career in 
corporate strategy in the banking sector in both Sy
dney and London, 
she turned to spiritual enquiries through Vi nyasa y
oga teacher training.
 
Concurrently
,
 
her early psy
chedelic experiences shaped her holistic 
enquiry into the human experience. 
N
o
w
,
 
Y
u
n seeks to share the wisdom 
and know
ledge she has acquired through years of practical research.
Michael and Y
un'
s
 exploration has led to their philosophical enquiries,
 
which aim to reconcile science and spirituality
.
 
They collaborate on 
creative projects,
 w
hich are housed at The Psy
.
