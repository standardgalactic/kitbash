A detailed list of all of the projects I'm working on
ChatGPT dijo:
Based on our conversations and your evolving RSVP framework, here's a
detailed and categorized list
of all your major ongoing projects, research threads, and theoretical constructs. These span cosmology, field theory, cognition, computation, ethics, and media theory.
üåÄ I.
RSVP Field Theory - Core Framework
Foundational development of
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP)
as an alternative to spacetime-based physics.
RSVP Scalar-Vector Field Equations
Coupled evolution of scalar entropy field (Œ¶), vector baryon flow field (ùíó), and their conservation structures.
Includes ‚àá¬∑ùíó = S(Œ¶), thermodynamic source terms, and dynamic smoothing hypotheses.
Derived Geometry of RSVP
Use of derived stacks, cotangent complexes, shifted symplectic geometry (PTVV), and mapping stacks.
(-1)-shifted BV symplectic structures governing entropy evolution.
AKSZ sigma model formulation for scalar/vector fields in derived geometric context.
BV-BRST Formalism in RSVP
Full classical master equation for RSVP.
Ghost fields for diffeomorphism and entropy symmetry.
Gauge fixing, homological perturbation, and quantization paths.
üåå II.
RSVP Cosmology & Gravity
Developing RSVP as a replacement for ŒõCDM and emergent gravity models.
Entropic Smoothing Hypothesis
Universe evolves toward smoother scalar entropy configurations rather than expanding spacetime.
Explains CMB anisotropy smoothing without inflation.
Gravity as Entropy Descent
Comparison of RSVP with Jacobson, Verlinde, Carney emergent gravity.
RSVP reinterprets gravity as a gradient flow in Œ¶, not geometric curvature.
Cosmological Perturbations & Structure
Use of RSVP scalar field fluctuations to explain structure formation.
Field-theoretic prediction of lensing, horizon, and CMB features.
Cyclic/Recursive Cosmogenesis
Time as a derived, semantic, or entropic index.

üß† III.
Cognition, Neural Fields & RSVP
Modeling consciousness and reflex within RSVP theory.
Plenum Intelligence & Reflex Dynamics
Cognitive feedback loops modeled via entropic descent and vector tiling.
Motor/sensory reflexes as threshold bifurcations in RSVP phase space.
Consciousness Metrics (œÜ_RSVP)
Definition of consciousness as entropy-bound semantic field activity.
Incorporates information geometry, causal closure, and complexity gradients.
Neural Implementation & RSVP Simulator
RSVP-based PDE simulation framework modeling neural fields and semantic binding.
fMRI-informed validation of RSVP-based consciousness models.
üî£ IV.
Computation & Semantic Tiling
Exploration of computation and information theory within RSVP field space.
TARTAN Framework
Thermodynamic Algebra for Recursive Tiling and Agency in Networks.
Recursive L-systems + Gray-code + entropy gradients as computation substrate.
Spherepop Calculus
Semantic language of topological spheres popping/merging in RSVP fields.
Bubble logic and rewriting over entropy-dense manifolds.
Yarncrawler
Entropic-pathfinding agent using RSVP tiling to traverse semantic terrain.
Connects tiling, logic, and computation.
üß¨ V.
Ethics, Rewriting, and Information Flow
RSVP as a normative framework for rewriting and thermodynamic ethics.

Ethical constraints on semantic rewriting rules.
Sigma models over derived stacks of rewriting algebras.
Thermodynamic Plena & Moral Gradients
Formal modeling of ethics as entropic-smoothing constraints.
Rewriting systems that favor semantic coherence and informational justice.

Moral agency as field-consistent rewriting.
Agency = ability to ethically smooth entropy across scales.
üéû VI.
Media Theory & Reconstruction
Application of RSVP to semiotics and media.
Media Quines
Systems that semantically reconstruct missing media modalities (e.g., video from text).
RSVP-based field coherence used to infer/restore lost information.

‚ñ°A as a field operator over scalar Œ¶ and vector ùíó constraints.
Temporal Logic & RSVP Semantics
