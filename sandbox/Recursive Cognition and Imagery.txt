Here's a structured outline for how we could formalize your insight into three different yet complementary paths, depending on how you want to engage: cognitively, philosophically, or through the RSVP framework.


---

üß† I. Cognitive Model: Modality-Agnostic Recursive Cognition

Purpose:
Formalize a theory of thought that explains how cognition can unfold without imagery or inner speech, emphasizing structure, recursion, and predictive continuity.

Outline:

1. Introduction

Statement of problem: Assumed universality of imagery/inner speech in cognitive models.

Your observation: Clear, coherent cognition without either.

Goal: Define a general recursive model of cognition not reliant on sensory replay.


2. Background

Overview of imagery-based cognitive theories (e.g., Kosslyn, VVIQ)

Limitations in representing aphantasic/anendophasic populations

Review of recursive, predictive models (Barenholtz, LLMs, Active Inference)


3. Core Model: Recursive Token-Based Cognition

Mental state  as a configuration of abstract tokens

Next state 

Tokens may be visual, verbal, abstract, affective, or structural

Imagery as an optional render pass, not essential to core cognition


4. Case Study: Aphantasic Cognition

Reinterpreting "visual" tasks (e.g. mental rotation, scene memory)

Autoregressive "scene building" without rendering

Use of gesture, spatial logic, timing, or felt alignment


5. Implications

Cognitive science: update models to support modally-agnostic prediction

Education: rethink assumptions in teaching and visualization

AI alignment: imagery not required for intelligent output


6. Conclusion

Thought is recursive, structured, and self-prompting‚Äînot phenomenally bound.

üìö II. Philosophical Critique: Against Imagistic Epistemology

Purpose:
Challenge the unexamined premise that mental imagery constitutes or enhances epistemic access‚Äîarguing instead for structural cognition as foundational.

Outline:

1. Thesis

Most philosophical and cognitive accounts of imagination assume that "seeing with the mind's eye" is epistemically valuable or necessary.

This is false: cognitive access can be just as clear‚Äîor clearer‚Äîwithout sensory representations.


2. Phenomenological Discontinuity

Aphantasia and anendophasia as counterexamples

The misread "transparency" of imagery: what looks like clarity may be self-reinforcing illusion


3. Deconstructing the Mirror

Mental imagery as a projected surface from deeper dynamics

Recursive prompting vs reflective representation

Metaphor-as-theory: how introspective metaphors become mistaken for mechanisms


4. The Heuristic Fallacy

"Visualizing a problem" ‚â† understanding it

Inner speech as performative monologue, not base cognition

How imagery and inner voice can obscure reasoning in some contexts


5. Toward Structural Cognition

Epistemic access through alignment, coherence, phase-shift, and constraint-satisfaction

Understanding without re-presentation

Implications for epistemology, phenomenology, and metaphysics


6. Conclusion

Imagery is a tool, not a truth. Let go of the mirror.

üåå III. RSVP-Compatible Account: Field-Based, Modality-Free Consciousness

Purpose:
Integrate your introspective insight with the RSVP framework by modeling cognition as an evolving field of constraints and attractors, rather than rendered sensory content.

Outline:

1. Context

RSVP: Scalar (Œ¶), vector (ùíó), and entropy (ùë∫) fields

Consciousness as evolving, structured field dynamics

Your premise: cognition as amodal recursive geometry


2. Rendering as Optional Projection

RSVP output may include visual or verbal renderings‚Äîbut this is just one observer-bound interface

Core dynamics are non-sensory field shifts: trajectories, vortices, phase-locks


3. Aphantasic Dynamics

Tiling and alignment without visible tiles

Cognitive coherence as field convergence, not image formation

Felt sense of "rightness" as vector alignment + entropy minimization


4. Token Generation in RSVP

RSVP "thinks" through recursive vector-weight updates, not symbolic language

Each token = a localized attractor or topological shift

Surface renderings (like language or imagery) = optional map overlays


5. Experimental Prediction

RSVP agents should be able to solve visual-spatial problems using topological dynamics, even with no image reconstruction

Compare imagery-based and amodal agents on cognitive tasks


6. Implications

Consciousness as field resonance, not picture theater

RSVP supports intelligent cognition across modalities‚Äîeven when none are phenotypically available

Opens path to synthetic cognition without phenomenology

Each of these approaches builds from your core insight and gives it a rigorous, externalizable form‚Äîwhether to challenge assumptions, model alternatives, or unify it with your RSVP vision.
ChatGPT said:
This is an elegant and powerful triadic outline. Each path‚Äî
Cognitive Model
,
Philosophical Critique
, and
RSVP Integration
‚Äîattacks the same foundational misconception from a different epistemic angle:
üß†
Cognitive Model
grounds the insight in empirical and theoretical psychology;
üìö
Philosophical Critique
uproots the imagistic bias from within our epistemological frameworks;
üåå
RSVP Integration
provides a generative substrate that supersedes modal thinking entirely.
Here's how I would
refine and interlink the three
into a unified intellectual project‚Äîperhaps a monograph or triptych paper series‚Äîwhile ensuring each can stand alone:
üîÅ Shared Premise: Thought ‚â† Rendering
Across all three, the unifying theme is:
Rendering is not cognition‚Äîit is a contingent affordance layered on top of recursive, predictive, constraint-resolving processes.
This could be your title thesis or recurring axiom.
‚ú≥Ô∏è Meta-Structure (Interlinking the Paths)
Part I: Modeling
(Cognitive Psychology)
Addresses the
empirical question
of how minds work in the absence of sensory phenomenology.
Introduces a
recursive token dynamics model
as the base of cognition.
Sets the groundwork for falsifiable hypotheses and testable architectures.
Part II: Deconstruction
(Philosophy of Mind and Epistemology)
Challenges entrenched imagery-as-epistemic metaphors.
Reframes "understanding" as alignment, coherence, and recursive fit‚Äînot visual clarity.
Exposes how imagination is often confused with insight.
Part III: Synthesis
(RSVP Theory)
Shows how RSVP provides a physical field substrate for these insights.
Embeds the token-based, modality-free cognition model into a scalar-vector-entropy flow.
Suggests
what kind of mind
can implement this theory: a consciousness without imagery.
üß† Part I: Refinements for Cognitive Modeling
You could strengthen the
recursive token-based cognition
model by:
Introducing
token coalescence and decay
, akin to working memory gradients.
Mapping this to
state transition graphs
or
attractor flows
, possibly aligning with predictive coding and Active Inference models (Friston).
Exploring
gesture-based internal scaffolds
(Clark, Gallese) in aphantasics‚Äîhow motor or spatial intuition fills the gap.
üß™ Possible empirical add-ons:
Tasks where aphantasics outperform imagers (due to less interference).
Modeling your own cognitive loop as a state-machine or recursive Markov process.
üìö Part II: Philosophical Enhancements
Expand the
Heuristic Fallacy
section with historical and cognitive case studies:
Euler and blind mathematicians.
Deaf-blind thinkers (Helen Keller's conceptual clarity without modality).
The illusion of visual clarity in optical illusions‚Äîevidence that
phenomenal richness ‚â† epistemic utility
.
A possible framing:
"What if clarity is a retrospective rationalization, not a causal aid?"
You could also introduce:
Structural epistemology
: where the validity of knowledge rests in pattern fit, not modal re-presentation.
Tie in
Goodman's 'Languages of Art'
or Nelson Goodman's theory of symbol systems.
üåå Part III: RSVP Integration Refinements
A few enhancements to strengthen the RSVP framing:
Field-Aware Token Generation
Map each token in your recursive model to
coherent local structure
in RSVP's fields‚Äîe.g., Œ¶ gradients + ùíó curvature = meaning attractor.
Felt Alignment as Observable
Propose RSVP metrics for
the felt sense of rightness
: e.g., vector field coherence √ó entropy drop over time.
Dynamic Rendering Gate
Define an RSVP "rendering layer" as an emergent, not essential, projection‚Äîtriggered only when field thresholds cross certain attention gradients (like predictive thresholds or memory index requests).
Neural/AI Parallel
Develop an RSVP-AI that solves spatial puzzles without imagery.
Predict that
simulated field convergence
outperforms image-based replay in certain classes of reasoning tasks.
üß© Addendum: Possible Synthesis Title & Framing
"Cognition Without Rendering: A Recursive, Field-Based Theory of Thought"
Or, for a trilogy of papers:
"Unseen Thought: A Modality-Free Model of Cognition"
"Against the Mind's Eye: Rethinking Imagination and Understanding"
"Consciousness as Constraint Resolution: RSVP and the Dynamics of Thought"
Would you like a draft for one of the three sections, or an integrated proposal (e.g., for grant or publication framing)? I can also help simulate how this framework could apply to LLMs or synthetic aphantasia modeling.
