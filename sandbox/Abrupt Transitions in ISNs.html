, Shlomo Havlin 3 &amp; Aviad Frydman 3 Phase transitions are
fundamental features of statistical physics. While the well-studied
continuous phase transitions are known to be controlled by external
global changes affecting the order parameter, the origin of abrupt
transitions is not fully clear. Here we show that abrupt phase
transitions may occur due to a unique internal random spatial cascading
mechanism, arising from dependency interactions. We experimentally
unveil the underlying mechanism of the abrupt transition in
interdependent superconducting net- works to be governed by a unique
metastable state of a long-living resistance cascading plateau. This
plateau is characterized by spontaneous cascading events that occur at
random locations and last for thousands of seconds, followed by a sudden
global phase shift of the system. The plateau time length changes with
the system size and distance from criticality, obeying scaling laws with
critical exponents. Furthermore, like epidemic spreading, these changes
are characterized by a branching factor which equals exactly one at the
critical point and deviates from one off criticality. Importantly, the
branching factor provides an early warning for the closeness of critical
catastrophic cascades yielding system collapse. Phase transitions (PTs)
are among the most intriguing phenomena of statistical mechanics and are
usually classified by their macroscopic features close to the critical
point1-4 . Second-order PTs are character- ized by a continuous
transition of the order parameter at the critical point, while
first-order PTs display an abrupt change between phases5 . In contrast
to first-order PTs, second-order PTs display critical beha- vior near
the critical point characterized by the scaling laws of different
quantities2,3 . A unique class of PTs is mixed-order PTs, which display
both an abrupt change similar to first-order transitions, and scaling
laws and critical exponents near the critical point similar to second-
order transitions6-10. Here we present experimental findings on the
cascading mechanism origin of interdependent superconducting net- works
that exhibit a mixed-order phase transition. The paradigm of physical
interdependent networks has recently been introduced by the realization
of the first physical manifestation of an experimental setup of
interdependent systems - interdependent superconducting networks
(ISN)11. This experimental discovery paves the way for a new research
avenue of interdependent materials. ISNs have been found to experience
an abrupt transition, as predicted by the theory of interdependent
networks12, arising from the interplay of two types of interactions in
the system: connectivity interactions within each network allowing
current to flow, and dependency inter- actions between the networks in
the form of thermal dissipation. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism
of the abrupt transition and its critical behavior remained elusive.
Here, we reveal experimentally and theoretically the underlying
mechanisms behind the abrupt jump observed in ISNs. We identify and
characterize the temporal-spatial scaling of the long-term plateau
state, which represents a random cascading mechanism of PTs. The plateau
time length changes with the system size and distance from criticality
via scaling laws characterized by universal critical exponents. Like
epidemic spreading, these cas- cading changes are governed by a
branching ratio that equals one ChatGPT said: The article ‚ÄúThe random
cascading origin of abrupt transitions in interdependent systems‚Äù ( DOI:
10.1038/s41467-025-61127-z ) presents a significant advancement in
understanding the microscopic dynamics that underlie abrupt or
mixed-order phase transitions , specifically in interdependent
superconducting networks (ISNs) . Here are the key insights from the
paper: üîç Core Discovery The study reveals that abrupt transitions in
interdependent systems are driven by a random cascading mechanism ,
which unfolds internally through metastable states‚Äî not solely from
external global tuning of an order parameter . This internal mechanism
takes the form of long-lived resistance plateaus followed by sudden
global phase shifts . These plateaus are sustained by localized, random
cascading events that persist for thousands of seconds before an abrupt
systemic transition. ‚öôÔ∏è Experimental System: Interdependent
Superconducting Networks (ISNs) ISNs consist of two superconducting
networks coupled thermally but not electrically. Connectivity
interactions allow current flow within each network. Dependency
interactions (thermal coupling) link the two, meaning the state of one
network affects the other‚Äôs ability to maintain superconductivity. This
setup physically realizes the abstract concept of interdependent
networks from theoretical studies. üìâ Mixed-Order Phase Transition
Characteristics ISNs exhibit mixed-order transitions , meaning they
display: A sudden, first-order-like jump in resistance. But also
critical scaling behavior characteristic of second-order transitions.
This unusual combination suggests a hybrid universality class . üìà
Cascading Plateau: A Metastable Signature The system enters a plateau
regime , where resistance remains stable, but beneath the surface, local
cascading events occur. These cascades propagate spatially and
temporally , ultimately triggering the full phase shift. The plateau
duration scales with: System size Distance from criticality This obeys
power-law scaling laws with well-defined critical exponents . üå≥
Branching Factor as Early Warning Signal Analogous to epidemic models ,
the branching ratio of cascading events plays a central role: At the
critical point, the branching ratio = 1 , meaning each cascade spawns
exactly one new cascade. Deviations from 1 indicate subcritical or
supercritical behavior. This branching factor provides a quantitative
early warning of imminent catastrophic collapse (i.e., global phase
transition). üß† Theoretical Implications The findings challenge the idea
that abrupt transitions require externally driven first-order dynamics.
Instead, they suggest that long-lived internal metastable dynamics and
stochastic propagation can produce abrupt macroscopic effects . This
reframes certain phase transitions as emergent phenomena from random
cascades , not purely thermodynamic bifurcations. üîÑ Relevance Beyond
Superconductors The cascading mechanism could underlie abrupt
transitions in a variety of complex systems , including: Power grids
Ecological systems Social contagion models Financial collapses
Percolation networks The universality of the scaling exponents and the
branching ratio framework hints at a general principle for cascading
failures in interdependent systems. üß© Connection to RSVP and Beyond If
you‚Äôre integrating this into your RSVP framework: The cascading plateaus
resemble localized entropy traps or metastable vector field domains. The
branching cascade mechanism may correspond to constraint relaxation
waves within a negentropic vector field, where tipping points are
emergent from spatially distributed recursive interactions. The
branching factor could serve as a local entropy coherence measure
(analogous to œÜ_RSVP) predicting phase transitions in coupled
scalar-vector systems. Let me know if you‚Äôd like: A figure or schematic
