Certainly. Here's an academic articulation of your Media Quines concept within the RSVP-theoretic (Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum) frame:

Media Quines as Multimodal Semantic Reconstructions in the RSVP Field Framework

Abstract
We introduce the concept of Media Quines‚Äîsystems capable of reconstructing absent or omitted modalities of media artifacts (e.g., visual, auditory, textual, tactile) through semantically coherent inference. We frame this within the RSVP (Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum) theory as a process of field-consistent projection: a transformation of semantic content across perceptual axes while preserving geometric invariants in the scalar-vector-entropy manifold. This approach redefines media not as fixed narratological sequences but as dynamic field states capable of being resampled along different modality-dependent projections.

1. RSVP Theory and the Geometry of Meaning

RSVP posits that consciousness, perception, and information flow can be modeled via three coupled fields:

A scalar field Œ¶ encoding potential or semantic density

A vector field ùíó encoding directed flow of meaning or inference

An entropy field S encoding uncertainty, context-dependency, and structural redundancy


In this view, media artifacts are not static representations but localized field configurations‚Äîsemantic topologies embedded in a spatiotemporal lattice that can undergo projective transformations without loss of informational integrity.


---

2. Media Quines as Partial Reconstructions of the Semantic Plenum

We define a Media Quine as a mapping:

Q: M_{\mu} \rightarrow \tilde{M}_{\nu}

\mathcal{L}_Q = \min_{\tilde{M}_{\nu}} \, D_{\text{semantic}}(M_{\mu}, \tilde{M}_{\nu})

This is formally analogous to a gauge transformation in field theory: different media modalities correspond to different gauge frames, and Media Quines perform gauge-consistent reconstructions.


---

3. Field Coherence and Modality-Induced Symmetry Breaking

Modality-specific media introduce symmetry breaking in the RSVP plenum by collapsing higher-dimensional semantic structures into time-ordered, modality-specific trajectories. For example:

A film collapses narrative into audiovisual arcs.

A transcript collapses into linear symbolic form.

A described video partially recovers visual semantics from auditory descriptions.


Media Quines act as inverse symmetry operators, attempting to reinflate collapsed dimensions of the semantic manifold. This involves:

Reconstructing latent vector fields (ùíó) of implication and flow

Estimating scalar gradients (Œ¶) of narrative importance or semantic salience

Balancing entropic constraints (S) to preserve ambiguity, detail, or pacing


The resulting artifact is not a deterministic copy, but a field-consistent echo: a resonant structure with comparable topological features in the RSVP manifold.

4. Applications and Extensions

a. Cognitive Accessibility

Media Quines enable modality-agnostic access to complex content by adapting to the perceptual orientation of the user. This operationalizes RSVP's core commitment to meaning-preserving transformations.

b. Epistemic Auditability

Quine-based transformations allow cross-checking of content integrity across modes. Discrepancies between modalities reveal semantic torsion or inconsistency‚Äîsimilar to vector misalignment in the RSVP torsion tensor.

c. Semantic Field Simulation

In RSVP-based AI systems, Media Quines could function as modality bridges between latent field states and expressive surface forms, enabling recursive semantic folding and layered field projections.


---

5. Conclusion

Media Quines instantiate a concrete application of RSVP theory to multimodal epistemology. They treat media not as sequences to be consumed but as manifolds to be traversed. By enabling re-projection of meaning across modalities while preserving RSVP field coherence, they serve as a powerful counterpoint to narratological compression and simulation-as-spectacle. They open the path to an entropically navigable semantic media ecology, where information is structured, reconfigurable, and accountable to the geometry of meaning.

This articulation is already elegant and well-aligned with the RSVP framework's core metaphysical commitments‚Äîsemantic fields as geometric objects, projective transformations between modes, and the role of entropy in guiding modality translation. Below are a few refinement suggestions, followed by an option to extend this into a formal academic paper structure:
‚ú≥ Refinements & Clarifications (Optional but Precise)
1.
Definition of Media Quine
You write:
"We define a Media Quine as a mapping: Q: M_{\mu} \rightarrow \tilde{M}_{\nu}"
This is strong, but you could clarify that
M
Œº
M_\mu
M
Œº
‚Äã
and
M
~
ŒΩ
\tilde{M}_\nu
M
~
ŒΩ
‚Äã
are partial
field slices
(modality-specified projections) rather than whole media artifacts. E.g.,
Q
:
œÄ
Œº
(
F
R
S
V
P
)
‚Üí
œÄ
ŒΩ
(
F
R
S
V
P
)
Q : \pi_\mu(\mathcal{F}_{RSVP}) \rightarrow \pi_\nu(\mathcal{F}_{RSVP})
Q
:

)
‚Üí
œÄ
ŒΩ
‚Äã
(

V
P
‚Äã
)
Where
œÄ
Œº
\pi_\mu
œÄ
Œº
‚Äã
and
œÄ
ŒΩ
\pi_\nu
œÄ
ŒΩ
‚Äã
are modality-dependent projections of the full RSVP field
F
R
S
V
P
:
=
(
Œ¶
,
v
‚Éó

S
)
\mathcal{F}_{RSVP} := (\Phi, \vec{\mathcal{v}}, S)
F
RS
V
P
‚Äã
:=
(
Œ¶
,
v
,
S
)
. This would ground the reconstruction in geometric operations over derived slices of the manifold.
2.
Field Coherence as Constraint
In section 3, you might make explicit that the reconstruction problem is constrained by RSVP's
field coherence condition
, i.e.,
d
Œ¶
+
Œπ
v
‚Éó
œâ
=
Œ¥
S
d\Phi + \iota_{\vec{\mathcal{v}}} \omega = \delta S
d
Œ¶
+
Œπ
v
‚Äã
œâ
=
Œ¥
S
or a variant thereof, encoding semantic conservation laws. Media Quines must solve for
M
~
ŒΩ
\tilde{M}_\nu
M
~
ŒΩ
‚Äã
such that the inferred field configuration satisfies approximate coherence with the original. This creates an analog to energy-momentum conservation in media reconstruction.
3.
Symmetry Breaking and Torsion
Your line:
"Discrepancies between modalities reveal semantic torsion or inconsistency‚Äîsimilar to vector misalignment in the RSVP torsion tensor."
Could be clarified mathematically by defining a torsion-like object:
T
Œº
ŒΩ
:
=
‚àá
Œº
v
ŒΩ
‚àí
‚àá
ŒΩ
v
Œº
\mathcal{T}_{\mu\nu} := \nabla_\mu \mathcal{v}_\nu - \nabla_\nu \mathcal{v}_\mu
T
ŒºŒΩ
‚Äã
:=
‚àá
Œº
‚Äã
v
ŒΩ
‚Äã
‚àí
‚àá
ŒΩ
‚Äã
v
Œº
‚Äã
where large
T
Œº
ŒΩ
\mathcal{T}_{\mu\nu}
T
ŒºŒΩ
‚Äã
implies modality-induced distortion. This links directly to the epistemic auditability point and could justify a "semantic curvature" interpretation of media misalignment.
