Research Portfolio Overview
This document presents a comprehensive overview of 24 research and creative initiatives under
the Flyxion portfolio, centered on the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory. RSVP
reinterprets spacetime as a dynamic interplay of scalar, vector, and entropy ﬁelds, challenging
conventional metric-based models such as ΛCDM cosmology.
The portfolio spans eight domains, encompassing theoretical physics, cosmology, cognitive
science, artiﬁcial intelligence, computational frameworks, architecture, ethics, and cultural ex-
pression. Each domain integrates RSVPs core principles with practical applications, experi-
mental validations, and philosophical inquiries, fostering a holistic approach to understanding
complex systems across scales.
The projects listed below are organized by domain, each with a clear title and detailed descrip-
tion that situates the work within the RSVP framework. The descriptions emphasize theoretical
underpinnings, interdisciplinary connections, and potential impacts, aligning with academic
standards suitable for grant proposals, seminars, or preprints.
This portfolio reﬂects a commitment to advancing knowledge through rigorous mathematical
modeling, innovative computational tools, and speculative yet grounded explorations of con-
sciousness, cosmology, and societal systems.
Core Field Theory and Simulation
1. RSVP Theory
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory proposes a paradigm shift in cos-
mology and physics by replacing metric-based spacetime with a dynamic ﬁeld system
comprising a scalar entropy potential ﬁeld (Φ), a vector negentropic ﬂux ﬁeld (⃗⊑), and
an entropy density ﬁeld (S). The theory posits that cosmic evolution arises from entropic
smoothing, negentropic ﬂow, and vector torsion, driven by constraint relaxation rather
than metric expansion. Outputs include coupled ﬁeld equations, lattice-based computa-
tional models, cosmological predictions for redshift and structure formation, and a meta-
physical reinterpretation of space, time, and information.
2. RSVP Simulator
The RSVP Simulator is a computational tool designed to model the dynamics of Φ, ⃗⊑,
and S ﬁelds across a 32×32 grid or hierarchical tiled systems. It employs advection-
diffusion equations, torsion dynamics, and entropy coupling to visualize ﬁeld interactions
1

in real time. Key metrics include the RSVP consciousness functional (ϕRSVP), ﬁeld co-
herence, and thermodynamic complexity, enabling simulations of both cosmic structures
and cognitive processes. The simulator serves as a testbed for theoretical predictions and
interdisciplinary applications.
3. RSVP Roadmap (2024-2030)
This meta-project outlines a strategic plan for RSVP development from 2024 to 2030.
It includes formalizing partial differential equations (PDEs) and theoretical foundations
(20242025), developing interactive simulations and AI integration (20252026), conduct-
ing observational tests against ΛCDM cosmology (20262027), and exploring quantum
ﬁeld theory (QFT) and cognitive system integrations (20272030). The roadmap ensures
a structured progression from theoretical innovation to experimental validation and prac-
tical implementation.
Cosmology and Gravity
4. Entropic Redshift Mechanism
This project posits that cosmological redshift results from light propagating through en-
tropy gradients in the RSVP ﬁeld, offering an alternative to metric expansion in ΛCDM
cosmology. By simulating photon trajectories through scalar entropy landscapes, the
project aims to replicate observed redshift patterns and propose experimental tests to
distinguish RSVPs predictions from standard models, potentially reshaping our under-
standing of cosmic evolution.
5. Gravity as Entropy Descent
Gravity is reframed as a gradient ﬂow within the scalar entropy ﬁeld (Φ), distinct from
curvature-based or entanglement-driven models proposed by Verlinde, Jacobson, and
Carney. This project develops a thermodynamic interpretation of gravitational attrac-
tion as recursive ﬁeld relaxation, supported by mathematical models and simulations
that align RSVP with observed gravitational phenomena, offering a novel perspective on
fundamental forces.
6. CMB and Structure Formation
This initiative replaces inﬂationary models with RSVPs entropic smoothing hypothesis to
explain the isotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Structure formation is
modeled through scalar ﬁeld perturbations and vector ﬂow bifurcations, predicting grav-
itational lensing, horizon scales, and CMB features. The project aims to validate RSVPs
explanatory power through computational simulations and comparisons with observa-
tional data.
7. Cyclic/Recursive Cosmogenesis
This project conceptualizes time as an emergent index derived from entropic re-encoding
within RSVP ﬁelds. Cosmic evolution is modeled as a series of semantic resets and feed-
back loops, where entropy gradients drive recursive cycles of structure formation. The
framework challenges linear temporal models, proposing a cyclical cosmology grounded
in ﬁeld dynamics and information theory.

Cognition, Neurodynamics, and AI
8. Plenum Intelligence
Plenum Intelligence models thought as a dynamic smoothing process within RSVP ﬁeld
space, where cognitive processes emerge from entropic gradient ﬂows and vector ﬁeld
bifurcations. Reﬂexes and feedback loops are conceptualized as threshold-driven transi-
tions, providing a ﬁeld-theoretic framework for understanding consciousness and decision-
making across biological and artiﬁcial systems.
9. Brain as Semantic Vector Transformer
This project proposes that the brain performs ﬁber bundle transformations over a latent
scalar-vector space, driven by entropic descent. It incorporates central pattern generators
(CPGs), semantic reﬂex arcs, and phonological loops, mapping cognitive processes to
RSVP dynamics. The model offers a geometric interpretation of neural computation,
bridging neuroscience and ﬁeld theory.
10. RSVP-AI
RSVP-AI develops a non-symbolic, ﬁeld-based artiﬁcial intelligence architecture using
RSVP principles. It employs the TARTAN framework for recursive tiling with trajectory
memory and introduces semantically meaningful perturbations as ﬁeld noise. The project
aims to create meaning-aware AI systems capable of modeling intention, control, and
agency, redeﬁning computational cognition.
Computation and Rewriting Systems
11. TARTAN Framework
The Thermodynamic Algebra for Recursive Tiling and Agency in Networks (TARTAN)
is a computational framework that leverages recursive entropy-based tiling to model com-
putation and agency. Using L-systems, trajectory-aware updates, and Gray-code struc-
tures, TARTAN encodes dynamic ﬁeld interactions, enabling simulations of cognitive
and systemic processes within the RSVP paradigm.
12. Spherepop Calculus
Spherepop Calculus is a semantic computational language based on topological spheres
that merge, split, or persist within RSVP ﬁelds. Operating as a bubble logic system, it
models knowledge representation and ﬁeld ﬂows, providing a novel approach to compu-
tation that integrates topological and entropic principles for information processing.
13. Yarncrawler
Yarncrawler conceptualizes sentient agents that repair entropy trails within RSVP ﬁeld
space, metaphorically akin to infrastructure maintenance. The project extends to com-
putational models of agency and architectural applications, where ﬁeld dynamics inform
the design of self-regulating systems capable of navigating and restructuring complex
environments.

Architecture, Infrastructure, and Biology
14. Xylomorphic Architecture
Xylomorphic Architecture models urban and biological systems on the feedback loops of
forests and pulp ﬂow, integrating writable walls and mycelial microchips as conscious in-
frastructure. This project explores bio-inspired design principles, aiming to create adap-
tive, self-aware urban environments that align with RSVPs thermodynamic and informa-
tional frameworks.
15. Yarncrawler Machines
Yarncrawler Machines are slow-moving, consciousness-compatible vehicles that regen-
erate infrastructure through motion, such as roof-walkers or reconﬁgurable scaffolders.
Modeled as bodily tissue within RSVPs ﬁeld dynamics, these machines restore environ-
mental and structural integrity, blending engineering with biological metaphors.
16. Dynamic Garbage Collection
This project develops a decentralized urban cleanliness system using app-ﬂagged garbage
placement and sensor-driven route recomputation. Informed by RSVPs entropy man-
agement principles, it promotes adaptive ecology through neural rerouting, reimagining
waste management as a dynamic, ﬁeld-aligned process.
Physical and Cognitive Experimentation
17. RSVP PDE Solver
The RSVP PDE Solver is a computational tool for simulating the evolution of entropy,
scalar, and vector ﬁelds, benchmarking cosmological structure formation and conscious-
ness metrics. Using ﬁnite difference or spectral methods, it validates RSVPs predictions
across physical and cognitive domains, serving as a cornerstone for experimental re-
search.
18. fMRI and Neural Correlates
This project hypothesizes that RSVP ﬁeld dynamics manifest in cortical entropy ﬂows,
detectable through fMRI temporal signatures. By synchronizing RSVP simulations with
neural imaging, it seeks to validate ﬁeld-theoretic models of consciousness, bridging
theoretical physics with neuroscientiﬁc experimentation.
19. Tiling Computation Experiments
Tiling Computation Experiments test the computational universality of the TARTAN
framework through agent-based simulations. By modeling recursive entropy paths, the
project demonstrates how RSVP-based tiling can support general computation and agency,
with applications in AI and complex system design.
Philosophy, Epistemology, and AI Ethics
20. The Con: Advertising and AI
This project examines advertising as the original misalignment of AI, where click-maximization
and surveillance capitalism distorted optimization goals. It explores alignment failures
4

and proposes techno-ethical reforms, situating AI ethics within RSVPs framework of
entropy gradient coherence and informational justice.
21. Model-Free Methods Archive
This project focuses on preserving and expanding research on model-free methods (MFMs),
emphasizing non-symbolic, modular intuition systems. It integrates concepts such as dis-
tributed communication architectures and dynamic cognitive frameworks into RSVP-AI,
enhancing ﬁeld-based AI with epistemically robust decision-making approaches.
22. Thermodynamic Ethics and Gradient Sovereignty
This initiative formalizes ethics as a constraint on entropy gradients within RSVP ﬁelds,
where moral agency is deﬁned as the ability to smooth entropy in alignment with seman-
tic coherence. Gradient Sovereignty conceptualizes agency as ﬁeld-consistent rewriting,
offering a novel framework for ethical decision-making.
Media, Game Design, and Expression
23. Blastoids (Retro Game)
Blastoids is a Descent-inspired, stationary cockpit shooter with a retro aesthetic featuring
CRT vector glow and glitch physics. Players target slow-moving asteroids in a medita-
tive, reﬂex-driven game that embeds philosophical themes of entropy and coherence,
reﬂecting RSVPs conceptual foundations.
24. Retrocausal Projects Soundtrack
This project creates an absurdist audio collage combining vintage radio snippets, or-
chestral stabs, found sounds, and upright bass. Tracks such as The Cosmic Workshop,
Recursive Control, Glitch Cathedral, and Entropy Choir capture the interdisciplinary,
chaotic energy of the Flyxion portfolio, aligning with RSVPs dynamic ﬁeld aesthetics
and retrocausal themes.
