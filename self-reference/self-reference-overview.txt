=== Summary for Laplace meets Godel： How Self reference Foils Prediction.txt ===
Jenann Ismael's talk at the Santa Fe Institute explores a puzzle related to prediction and self-reference within deterministic systems, challenging the notion that perfect prediction is always possible. She uses the Laplacean demon as a starting point—a hypothetical being that knows the positions and momenta of all particles in the universe at any given time, allowing it to predict the future with absolute certainty.

Ismael introduces a counter-prediction device that can be connected to such a demon: this device takes predictions about its output and does the opposite. She presents two versions of this puzzle: in the first, the predictor and the counter-predictive device are separate entities calculating independently; in the second, they communicate directly.

In both cases, Ismael argues that a deterministic system attempting to predict its own behavior will encounter a form of unpredictability caused by self-reference. She calls this phenomenon "interference," which occurs when representational activity (e.g., making predictions) and the resulting actions interact in a way that generates paradoxes or contradictions.

The master argument Ismael presents demonstrates that even an omniscient demon cannot accurately predict its own behavior when it is part of the system it's trying to model, due to this self-referential interference. She shows that the demon would face a losing game because any prediction it makes will be used against it by the counter-predictive device.

Ismael further argues that this unpredictability isn't merely a result of ignorance or indeterminism, but rather an inherent limitation for systems representing themselves. This highlights a "crack in the edifice of determinism" – suggesting that life and cognition exploit such unpredictability to function effectively.

In conclusion, Ismael emphasizes that our everyday experience of the world is shaped by this interference between representation and action. Our minds are not passive representers but active agents engaging in a form of counter-predictive interference, using information about expected events to guide behavior strategically—an arrangement she calls "selective inaccuracy."

This perspective challenges the idea that life and cognition are mere byproducts of physical law. Instead, it suggests they exploit laws of physics to direct energy flow toward their own goals. Additionally, Ismael implies that our sense of agency isn't an illusion but a manifestation of this counter-predictive interference—avoidance is possible when predictions are part of the system trying to be predicted.
