00:00.000 --> 00:09.060
So thanks so much for having me here. I'm really, really happy to be here. It's kind of a magical place, even more than I imagined.

00:09.660 --> 00:24.180
So the invitation asks for talk that would give you a sense of what I do. So I'm a philosopher of physics, so I think about lots of things like space, time, quantum mechanics, natural laws, the kinds of things that fall under the fold of philosophy of physics.

00:24.180 --> 00:33.720
But I also think, as Marina said, about the big, squishy questions, the kinds of questions that all of the systematic philosophers of the past thought about.

00:33.840 --> 00:41.180
So questions like, who are we? How do we fit into the architecture of the universe? What is life? What is mind? Is there free will?

00:41.920 --> 00:52.620
These are questions that science confronts in its own way, and that often take a sharp and really kind of illuminating form in the setting of a mathematically articulated physical theory.

00:52.620 --> 01:04.020
So what I'm going to do today, though, is I'm going to raise a really simple little puzzle and then talk my way through it that can cast some light on those kinds of big, squishy questions.

01:04.360 --> 01:11.560
I'm going to warn you, though, that there are no equations, no numbers, and no data or experiments in my talk.

01:11.560 --> 01:15.920
So don't throw any tomatoes at me. You invited me.

01:16.960 --> 01:26.700
But I'm hoping that you'll see that the value of a little simple point can really change the way you think about things that you think already that you understand really well.

01:26.700 --> 01:43.680
I'm happy to have you interrupt me if there's something that you don't understand, but I'll also tell you that I think you'll get the best out of me if you let me get it all out, kind of get the big picture out, because that will also help you decide which details matter.

01:43.680 --> 01:51.600
And also because philosophers are words people, the kind of the words are chosen carefully, I will absolutely stop hard at 40 minutes.

01:51.600 --> 01:57.920
So there will be lots of time for questions. But if there's something you don't understand, please feel free to stop me.

01:57.920 --> 02:07.740
So there's a kind of big picture image of the universe that had a lot of currency in the 20th century, universe of particles obeying deterministic laws.

02:08.320 --> 02:16.180
People now, of course, make concessions to our de facto ignorance and quantum mechanics, of course, has shaken this picture at the very foundation.

02:16.640 --> 02:23.920
But the idea persists, I think, that at least in this kind of ideal setting, perfect prediction is in principle possible.

02:23.920 --> 02:33.660
So Laplace gave us that sort of unshakable image of a demon that knows the positions and momenta of all of the particles of which universe is composed at the beginning of time.

02:34.140 --> 02:40.540
And as he says, embraces in a single formula everything that will ever happen through the history of the universe.

02:40.540 --> 03:00.100
So this big picture image of the universe, sorry, I would say that sort of image, of course, is really upsetting for our common sense conviction that if some demon came up to you and told you that you would, I don't know, raise your hand in a second from now, you could just flip them off.

03:00.100 --> 03:04.560
Right. But you're supposed to just suck it up and say, OK, so we're wrong.

03:04.660 --> 03:07.220
We've been wrong about plenty of things in the past.

03:07.480 --> 03:19.940
I want to take this very simple deterministic setting and use it to bring into focus a kind of unpredictability that has nothing to do with determinism or ignorance and a lot to do with your ability to kind of flip off a demon.

03:20.420 --> 03:22.340
If he tells you he knows what you will do.

03:22.340 --> 03:25.880
So here's the puzzle that started me thinking about all of this.

03:25.940 --> 03:33.440
So we have a theory, Newtonian mechanics, that says that a being that knew the initial conditions of the universe would be able to predict everything that happens.

03:33.740 --> 03:43.700
Same theory lets us construct a device that would let us that would be designed to undermine any revealed prediction of what it would do.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.460
So it wouldn't be hard to construct such a device.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.220
We're imagining here a simple input output machine.

03:49.420 --> 03:52.180
Maybe it has a light, a green light on top and a red light on top.

03:52.340 --> 03:58.380
It takes predictions of its output in a particular form in a specified format and then does the opposite of what it's predicted.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.460
So green light, if it's predicted, it will flash red and the opposite.

04:02.100 --> 04:02.200
OK.

04:03.140 --> 04:10.160
Now, if there could be a demon of the kind that Laplace describes, we could chain it together with this kind of device.

04:10.920 --> 04:14.560
We give the demon access to all physically accessible information.

04:14.680 --> 04:18.060
We let it make its calculation of the device's output.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.320
We feed it into the device.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.360
Now, what would happen here?

04:22.360 --> 04:27.100
At least, what does classical mechanics say would happen here?

04:27.100 --> 04:31.700
We don't have to fight about whether the device understands predictions.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.720
We're just going to assume that the predictor understands predictions.

04:35.720 --> 04:42.480
We'll let him use his language and fix the format of predictions and we'll design the device.

04:43.100 --> 04:43.200
OK.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.640
So all we have to suppose is that there's a fixed fact about what would count as a prediction being correct.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.360
And then we'll construct the device.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.440
So when it takes a prediction, what it will do in that form, it does the opposite.

04:53.980 --> 04:56.860
If this is something that worries you, keep it in mind.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.180
Prediction is a representational act.

04:59.240 --> 05:11.420
So this puzzle only gets off ground if you're willing to naturalize representational activity and accept that there are at least beings in the world that represent and have semantic content to their utterances.

05:11.420 --> 05:24.680
Now, in the early version of this puzzle, which comes out of a 1965 paper by Michael Scriven, what you have is a predictor and a counter predictive device, but they're not actually communicating with one another.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.100
So they're each performing their own calculation.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.020
A lot of people write papers.

05:29.160 --> 05:34.060
There's all of this discussion about who out calculates who.

05:35.040 --> 05:44.740
Then in a 2010 paper by Kuypers and Ruhmens, someone has this idea, what if we force the predictor to give its prediction to the counter predictive device?

05:44.800 --> 05:46.840
And that sort of changes everything.

05:47.040 --> 05:52.620
It's a really interesting move because it makes a good deal of the preceding discussion entirely irrelevant.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.900
We don't have to talk about who calculates faster.

05:55.220 --> 05:59.480
We don't even have to talk about how much information the device could have.

05:59.780 --> 06:00.800
Calculation is irrelevant.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.980
The counter predictive device just waits for the predictor to finish her calculation and then does the opposite.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.980
She doesn't even need to know anything else.

06:10.520 --> 06:16.280
So at this stage, it should be obvious, though, to the demon that the thing is rigged against him.

06:16.280 --> 06:23.820
He can predict that any prediction he will make will be used to override his prediction.

06:25.140 --> 06:37.900
Calculating isn't going to do him any good because his calculation will generate a piece of information that needs to be taken into account and that will override the result of his existing calculation and so on.

06:37.900 --> 06:51.400
So the demon is trying to make a prediction, but the prediction is connected to what happens in such a way that when he tries to do the computation, he's coming up against the fact that his prediction is going to affect what he predicts.

06:51.400 --> 07:00.120
So if you think of what the predictor is trying to do, he's effectively running a simulation of the evolution of the counter predictive device in his head.

07:00.180 --> 07:04.120
So he's performing calculation or evolving forward a mental model.

07:04.780 --> 07:11.540
He knows the output of his simulation is going to feed into the device and prompt a counter predictive response.

07:11.540 --> 07:19.180
So as soon as he finishes the simulation, he needs to run the simulation with the new output, prompting a new simulation, a different output, and so on.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.500
So his simulation has to include the result of his simulation.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.920
And in that sense, he's never going to get ahead of himself.

07:26.900 --> 07:32.820
So if he thinks about it hard enough, the predictor knows in advance that he's not going to get ahead.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.860
Trying to generate an accurate prediction of what the device is doing is chasing his own shadow.

07:37.860 --> 07:48.680
So you would encounter the same problem if you wanted to write a deterministic computer program that takes a prediction of its output and does the opposite.

07:50.040 --> 07:56.580
Again, you wrote the thing, so there's no missing information and there's no indeterminism.

07:57.320 --> 08:03.980
And still, if you trust the program, there's nothing you could learn, no information that you could have that's going to help.

08:03.980 --> 08:07.260
You shouldn't put any money on predicting the output.

08:08.940 --> 08:10.860
So what's going on here?

08:11.500 --> 08:16.520
So if you think about this in physical terms, it's at least a prima facie of puzzling.

08:16.920 --> 08:24.680
If the demon knows the initial conditions and the laws, he should be able to use those to generate a prediction with certainty.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.760
Deductively, it should follow.

08:27.460 --> 08:33.060
And yet he's faced with a situation where he knows that any prediction he makes is going to be used against him.

08:33.060 --> 08:36.840
It's a losing game for him, and he can see that in advance.

08:38.000 --> 08:51.780
So you might be looking here for ways to diffuse the problem by arguing, look, there are physical, there are practical bordering on in principle reasons that a calculation like this wouldn't be physically implementable.

08:51.780 --> 09:00.900
So, for example, you might think it's impossible to know the initial conditions with perfect precision, impossible to carry out the computation in practical time, and so on.

09:00.900 --> 09:08.900
But if all of those loopholes were closed, if you think about it, this is just like a closed causal loop.

09:08.900 --> 09:23.080
And we can make the analogy explicit by realizing that advanced predictions of a Laplacian predictor that is an infallible predictor would be effectively proxies for the events themselves.

09:23.080 --> 09:33.800
Since the demon predicts an event, if and only if it occurs, having an advanced prediction is just as good as having the event itself in its own past.

09:33.860 --> 09:37.620
So you can rig up something that has the same form as a closed causal loop.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.420
So here, closed causal loop takes E onto not E.

09:40.420 --> 09:52.800
Here, you just have an advanced prediction with certainty connected to the thing that it's supposed to predict, and then leading causally to the thing, to the opposite of the thing.

09:53.340 --> 10:00.160
So now, the analogy, once you have this analogy in mind, it makes it really tempting to reason this way.

10:00.160 --> 10:10.880
Look, so long as the demon has done his calculations correctly, the counter-predictive device is going to have to end up doing what he predicts.

10:11.180 --> 10:16.080
And that, of course, is the conclusion that many people have drawn from determinism.

10:16.080 --> 10:33.700
They imagine that if there were a demon that knew enough about the past, and used it to predict what you would do, that you would, for example, raise your arm in five seconds, you might think that if he told you about it, you could refuse.

10:35.720 --> 10:39.240
But unless he miscalculates, you're going to end up doing what he predicts.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.280
It'll be like death in Damascus.

10:41.280 --> 10:48.980
You'll try to avoid the fate that you're told you're going to encounter, and then your very efforts will somehow end up affirming the prediction.

10:49.480 --> 10:53.840
An intelligence that knew enough about the past could use the loss to predict the future with certainty.

10:54.020 --> 10:59.220
We're simply not going to succeed at doing anything other than what a demon like that predicts.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.940
That's the only consistent solution, you might think.

11:02.360 --> 11:06.860
And it's a familiar response to the grandfather paradoxes in the case of closed causal loops.

11:06.860 --> 11:17.900
But then you think about this for a little while, and you realize there's a perfectly general argument, independently of the physics.

11:18.400 --> 11:23.760
I'm going to call it the master argument, like obnoxiously, that that can't be right.

11:24.240 --> 11:30.900
There could never have been a demon of the type that we're imagining, not in classical mechanics, not in any theory.

11:30.900 --> 11:40.980
And probably some of you are already seeing it, looking at it sort of this way is going to turn the tables on the usual understanding of determinism.

11:41.120 --> 11:49.260
I'm going to suggest and bring into focus what I said before, a source of unpredictability that has nothing to do with ignorance or indeterminism.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.120
So here's the master argument.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.040
So forget about demons for now.

11:56.040 --> 12:06.760
Suppose we just want to program a computer to be our grand overarching database or repository of information, factual information about the physical world.

12:07.040 --> 12:11.540
So we set about programming it with as much factual information as we have.

12:11.620 --> 12:20.960
We program it with the laws of physics, all of the scientific knowledge we've amassed, facts we know about the history of the Earth, the monkeys of Costa Rica, and so on.

12:20.960 --> 12:30.340
The goal is to be able to put to it any question of physical fact, any yes-no question of physical fact, and an answer will appear in the output channel.

12:31.340 --> 12:35.520
Not hard to find a question, a physical fact that it can't answer.

12:35.780 --> 12:39.300
Just ask, is the answer that's about to appear in the output channel? No.

12:42.620 --> 12:47.960
So however it answers, it's going to be doing the opposite of what it says.

12:47.960 --> 12:55.080
By saying things, right, so let me back up.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.100
Think about this in physical terms.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.800
So the computer is a physical system, right?

12:59.980 --> 13:06.520
The question of what appears in its output channel is a question of physical fact, and yet it cannot answer truthfully.

13:07.300 --> 13:12.740
Notice that the problem here, again, is not a lack of information, nor is it indeterminism.

13:12.740 --> 13:19.660
And it's not just that you can't program the thing to answer correctly with certainty what it will do.

13:19.800 --> 13:25.400
The system can't even accidentally guess the correct answer to this question.

13:25.400 --> 13:31.920
And if you think about it in mechanical terms, it's very clear what's going on.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.400
There's no paradox here.

13:33.740 --> 13:47.100
What's going on is by saying things, the computer is doing things, and we can get a kind of interference between what it says, that is to say, the semantic content of the utterance, and what it does.

13:47.100 --> 14:03.120
The act it performs in making that utterance, and in general, if one is dealing with a physical system that's in the business of representing the world, so it's making statements or forming beliefs about the world, and it falls under its own scope,

14:03.120 --> 14:17.240
everything that it does, everything that it does is going to cast a shadow or register at the level of representation, at the semantic level, and every representational act is going to be connected in the domain that it's representing.

14:17.520 --> 14:22.760
It's going to be part of the causal order, and there are going to be these kinds of interaction effects.

14:22.760 --> 14:33.800
And what we've set things up here in the self-referential situation is that we've just set things up so that they're interfering negatively with one another.

14:35.460 --> 14:47.860
So in the case we're describing, the computer can't stabilize the fact that it's meant to describe the word that appears on screen independently of giving the answer, the description that it gives,

14:47.860 --> 14:53.200
and the thing is set up so that no matter what answer it gives, it's going to be doing the opposite.

14:53.340 --> 14:57.020
The answer is going to conflict with what it says. That's what I mean by negative interference.

14:57.920 --> 15:02.860
That's also what's going on with paradoxes of self-reference, and indeed with most semantic paradoxes.

15:05.220 --> 15:12.380
So again, there's no actual paradox here. There are perfectly consistent ways the world can be.

15:12.720 --> 15:17.380
The system can answer yes, it can answer no, it doesn't have to answer at all.

15:17.380 --> 15:21.040
Those are all perfectly physically consistent ways the world can be.

15:21.380 --> 15:25.060
It's just that whatever way it answers, it won't be speaking truly.

15:26.440 --> 15:33.940
So the right response, right reaction to the puzzle here is not inconsistency in the world, it's incompleteness in representation.

15:34.660 --> 15:44.100
So the thing has to maintain a kind of incompleteness in its representation on pain of inconsistency, not logical inconsistency, but inconsistency with fact.

15:44.100 --> 15:49.880
Because it's going to be producing a fact that disagrees with what it's saying.

15:52.820 --> 16:01.040
Interference, what I'm calling interference is just forcing into the open the fact that representational activity is part of the world,

16:01.040 --> 16:08.420
and self-reference is going to arise naturally and inevitably for any system that's representing the world from the inside.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.640
This is really what was behind the initial puzzle that I started with.

16:12.640 --> 16:20.000
It was the self-reference that the demon encountered when he tried to perform his calculation that sent him into that paralyzing loop.

16:20.440 --> 16:29.040
He goes to calculate the output of the counter predictive device, but he knows that the output of his calculation is going to feed into the device and prompt a counter response.

16:29.040 --> 16:35.660
So as soon as he finishes the calculation, he needs to run it again without output, prompting a new calculation, and so on.

16:35.940 --> 16:46.460
So it was the self-reference that was implicit in the calculation that he was trying to run that was getting him fouled up in the negative interference that was arranged between what he was trying to predict and the prediction.

16:46.460 --> 16:58.800
Now, the fact that you're going to run into interaction effects of your system in the world representing it is something that gets pushed out of view in most day-to-day physics.

16:59.260 --> 17:03.960
Because in most day-to-day physics, one is modeling other systems, pendula, planets, gases.

17:03.960 --> 17:14.400
We maintain a kind of provisional separation of subject, the thing doing the experiment, and the object, or investigator and the system being investigated.

17:14.980 --> 17:20.380
Even when we're modeling ourselves, we're typically not modeling our own current representational activity.

17:20.380 --> 17:34.960
But the people that have unavoidably encountered it, interestingly, are people that are, for example, trying to program an artificial general intelligence in a robot, so an embedded agent.

17:35.440 --> 17:44.340
So they want to program a system with general knowledge and the ability to model the world, and they're coming up against the fact that there are going to be problems of self-reference.

17:44.340 --> 17:49.560
Self-reference is usually, in that context, thought of as a pathology.

17:49.720 --> 18:00.700
So you want to get as close to minimizing any disturbances that the computer or the agent's own activity has on the truth values of sentences in the field that it's representing.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.420
But let me just point out that actually this is a familiar phenomenon.

18:08.860 --> 18:11.700
So negative interference can arise in other ways.

18:11.700 --> 18:19.140
So our government is trying to guess where a foreign army will attack, but they're tracking communications, and whatever we predict, they won't do.

18:20.040 --> 18:26.060
Google Maps predicts traffic congestion in the east part of the city at lunchtime, and people avoid the area.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.080
Positive interference arises as well.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.640
So positive interference is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.240
Man's insecurity about keeping his commitment.

18:35.380 --> 18:36.720
Shy lover drives her away.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.440
More hilariously, I hope you've all seen these XKCDs.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.440
Okay.

18:41.820 --> 18:53.280
So any system that is keeping his commitment shot, sorry, any system that's acting in the domain that it's representing is going to encounter these kinds of interaction effects.

18:53.720 --> 18:58.140
And they can interfere in complicated ways with peer knowledge acquisition.

18:58.140 --> 19:07.140
If the system's own activity is part of the domain it's representing, there just are going to be interactions between what it says and what it does.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.580
You can try to quarantine these effects.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.500
But in any highly connected domain, it's going to be impossible.

19:13.760 --> 19:20.360
There are going to be less direct effects because of the way that the system's behavior is connected in the wider domain.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.680
So just consider, for example, the computer we were talking to.

19:24.400 --> 19:24.500
Okay.

19:24.860 --> 19:30.700
We can say, okay, so just don't answer questions about yourself and your own representational activity.

19:30.820 --> 19:35.400
But what about questions like, will someone who looks at the answer to this question see the word no?

19:35.560 --> 19:42.560
If the computer has a database that records its answers, will the database tomorrow or a year after show that the answer had been no?

19:42.560 --> 19:53.060
If there's an internal counter that counts negative answers, triggers the launch of a rocket that knocks an asteroid off its course when it reaches a certain number, when will the rocket launch, right?

19:53.140 --> 19:57.920
So it's going to be harder than you think to quarantine the effects here.

19:57.920 --> 20:10.760
If there are causal connections between events in the domain, so that if the computer can transform an answer to one question into answers to others, there's going to be no simple way to contain the effects.

20:10.760 --> 20:19.100
So this is mostly a kind of philosophical point, but philosophers often think about knowledge in this sort of detached way.

20:19.600 --> 20:32.740
There are the way things are on the one hand, and there are representations of the way things are on the other, and truth is a kind of abstract, atemporal relation between your representations and the way things are.

20:34.120 --> 20:40.180
What we forget is that knowledge is part of the world, and it makes a difference to what happens.

20:41.760 --> 20:49.440
So interference is, I'm going to come back to that point in a minute, but interference is a familiar problem in some domains.

20:49.440 --> 20:58.860
So an influential analyst predicts a fall in the value of the stock, prompting a sell-off, polls in an election made public, prompts strategic voting, and affect the outcome.

20:59.400 --> 21:11.480
Anytime you have a prediction feeding back into the domain and affecting what it predicts, you have interference, and it's the paradox of predictability, that puzzle I started with, just on a larger scale.

21:11.480 --> 21:18.480
When you see it this way, there's nothing confusing about it.

21:18.480 --> 21:34.620
When you really naturalize representational activity, when you absorb it, that is to say, into the causal fabric of the universe, so you see that it plays a role in what happens, you recognize the possibility of these kinds of effects was there the whole time.

21:34.620 --> 21:43.720
It was always going to be a delicate question, how your own representational activity was going to affect what you were trying to represent.

21:43.720 --> 21:48.900
So there's a bunch of things that we can learn from this.

21:48.900 --> 22:01.340
The first is that it brings into focus what I said before, a kind of unpredictability that isn't simply ignorant, so it's not remediated by having more information, and has nothing to do with indeterminism.

22:01.740 --> 22:05.320
It has connections to the halting problem and to other puzzles of self-reference.

22:05.440 --> 22:16.740
So if you think about the predictor, counter-predictor device, with the halting problem in mind, suppose you can solve the halting problem, then you can construct a machine that halts if and only if it doesn't halt.

22:16.740 --> 22:25.980
Suppose there are a Laplacian predictor in the world, then you can construct a system that flashes a green light if and only if it's predicted that it flashes a green light.

22:26.260 --> 22:28.020
Same form of the problem.

22:29.240 --> 22:35.100
The second thing that you can learn is that it corrects a misunderstanding of the implications of determinism.

22:35.100 --> 22:54.140
So this idea that has wide currency, certainly in philosophy and in the public imagination, that it's just our ignorance that makes us think that the future is open, that a direct confrontation with the predictor without our mundane implications would just dispel the illusion that the future has that kind of openness.

22:54.740 --> 22:58.280
I think what this does is it sort of flips the script.

22:58.860 --> 23:00.880
Prediction is hostage to interference.

23:01.740 --> 23:02.740
Laplace was right.

23:02.740 --> 23:15.460
What he said was a demon outside the universe with access to its total state could predict the future with certainty, but that's because its predictions aren't going to interfere with what happens.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.600
It's not going to encounter these problems.

23:18.140 --> 23:30.680
But for any system in the world, interference is going to, it will encounter interference, and interference is going to be an absolute limiting factor on what it can predict.

23:30.680 --> 23:39.940
It's just like, as I said, if you try to write a deterministic computer program that takes a prediction of what it's going to do and does the opposite.

23:42.540 --> 23:50.480
The fact that you know that's going to happen, that you can predict the failure of your own prediction, doesn't help predict correctly.

23:50.480 --> 23:59.360
The fact that you have to keep your prediction secret to preserve its accuracy makes the point that interference defeats prediction.

24:00.320 --> 24:00.440
Okay.

24:00.980 --> 24:09.900
So there's a good physics question here about why, for example, classical mechanics doesn't furnish the in-principle possibility of an embedded demon.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.520
Happy to talk about that if you want to in question and answer.

24:13.520 --> 24:24.680
We know from the self-referential version of the argument that no theory tells you that there could be an embedded demon that can correctly answer all yes, no questions of fact about the world.

24:24.680 --> 24:37.480
Quite generally, the way that you should think about this is if you take any set of consistent laws that allows the emergence of systems that use information to guide behavior and that represent the world from inside,

24:37.780 --> 24:46.560
the laws will tell you where a particular system that is generating predictions and interacting with the environment, where it's going to encounter interference.

24:46.560 --> 25:00.640
But what I want to do for the rest of the time, and I promised I would stop with lots of time for questions, is I want to emphasize two very different types of lessons.

25:02.000 --> 25:09.680
One is I want to suggest that interference is the crack in the edifice of determinism that life and cognition exploit.

25:09.680 --> 25:19.580
And then I want to sort of just point out that we, as systems that represent the world and use it to guide our behavior, we live in the regime of interference.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.720
Our own experience of the world is organized around it.

25:23.720 --> 25:45.880
So on the first point, what interference really does is it just brings into focus the fact that representational activity, gathering information, modeling the world, generating predictions is tangled up in the causal fabric of the world, and it makes a difference to what happens.

25:45.880 --> 25:57.020
So that doesn't just mean that any system in the world that is doing these things will encounter interference as a kind of regrettable artifact of its embeddedness.

25:57.340 --> 25:59.900
This is what representational activity is for.

26:01.040 --> 26:14.480
In philosophy, as I said, we kind of talk about representation in that detached way, as though the goal of representation is truth, which is this timeless relation between the way things are and our representations.

26:14.480 --> 26:23.360
As soon as you embed representational activity in the world, you realize that your mind isn't there to passively represent.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.380
Representation is embodied activity, embedded creatures.

26:28.040 --> 26:31.080
Its natural purpose is not truth, but interference.

26:31.920 --> 26:41.560
The representational machinery in your head is guiding action in a way that works and is designed to work to offset predictions you don't like,

26:41.560 --> 26:52.080
to counteract, support, obstruct, and otherwise get in the way of your own predictions, if you don't like them, and promote the ones that you do.

26:52.080 --> 26:55.760
So think about these three different types of systems.

26:56.360 --> 27:00.120
A rock rolling down a hill, magnetotactic bacteria.

27:00.260 --> 27:06.800
These are bacteria that have organelles that contain magnetic crystals that keep them oriented towards magnetic north,

27:06.920 --> 27:10.340
sort of guiding them towards nutrient-rich environments.

27:10.340 --> 27:14.040
Or a frog that snaps out its tongue at a passing fly.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.300
Or a person making a decision.

27:16.300 --> 27:23.440
So look at, in the case of the rock, there's nothing of special interest that's kind of going on inside.

27:23.440 --> 27:30.640
In the case of the frog snapping out its tongue, or the bacteria, these are evolved systems.

27:31.020 --> 27:40.320
The internal machinery is using information to produce motor responses that allow the system to access free energy

27:40.320 --> 27:48.940
and do what it needs to offset the entropic tendencies of the environment that would otherwise lead to the system's dissolution.

27:49.380 --> 27:58.580
The logic of anticipating the future and then selecting responses that counteract or offset disfavored results

27:58.580 --> 28:02.280
is kind of implicit in those cases in the system's design.

28:02.280 --> 28:13.280
By the time you get to a person making a decision, the logic of anticipation and selecting responses to offset things that you don't like

28:13.280 --> 28:19.060
is explicit as a computation that the system is carrying out in real time.

28:19.520 --> 28:24.280
So we're running an internal simulation that assesses the impact of different behaviors

28:24.280 --> 28:28.420
and uses the outputs of the simulation to guide behavior in a preferred direction.

28:29.420 --> 28:35.460
And it's crucial to this arrangement, that the inner gears are engaging the outer machinery of the world

28:35.460 --> 28:40.080
in a way that's designed to create counter-predictive interference.

28:41.440 --> 28:45.860
So go back to the kind of the demon and the device.

28:46.420 --> 28:49.280
So in that case, we had the predictor and the responder,

28:49.840 --> 28:53.800
and the connection and the relationship between them was adversarial.

28:54.280 --> 28:56.320
The predictor's goal was prediction.

28:56.480 --> 28:59.140
The counter-predictive goal was FOIL prediction.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.820
But if you ask yourself, what is the human mind?

29:02.700 --> 29:09.680
It's effectively a system that generates prediction chained together with a counter-predictive device.

29:10.020 --> 29:13.340
But here we replace prediction with the more general expectations.

29:13.900 --> 29:16.880
So predictions take the form of a probability distribution,

29:17.460 --> 29:22.020
where before we had two adversarial systems, one to predict and one to FOIL a prediction.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.960
What if they work together?

29:23.960 --> 29:29.440
And the job of the whole system, not unlike the Poulter or the analyst,

29:29.660 --> 29:35.640
is not to achieve accuracy in its predictions, but rather a kind of selective inaccuracy.

29:36.040 --> 29:42.140
The job of the responder is to curb predictions it doesn't like and to promote ones that it does.

29:42.140 --> 29:49.580
So you can think of the system as a whole here as using what it knows and what it anticipates

29:49.580 --> 29:55.640
to guide responses in a way strategically designed to shift the downstream probabilities

29:55.640 --> 29:58.600
in a direction that it favors.

29:59.020 --> 30:00.000
So how does this work?

30:00.520 --> 30:06.000
Predictor uses information from the past to generate probability distribution over futures compatible with it.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.020
Responder takes a distribution, conditionalizes on different choices,

30:10.520 --> 30:17.480
and then makes the choices that maximizes expected utility or whatever your favorite decision rule is.

30:17.820 --> 30:18.980
But what's going on here?

30:19.300 --> 30:25.440
So I'm saying all of this just to show you that this actually has the form of the counter-predictive interference.

30:25.440 --> 30:33.640
The responder is effectively using interference to sculpt the future by getting in the way of predictions it doesn't like

30:33.640 --> 30:36.160
and behind ones that it does.

30:36.980 --> 30:47.340
So our own experience of the world is organized around paradox of predictability type interference.

30:48.480 --> 30:52.080
Paradox of predictability is just the name for that puzzle I started with.

30:52.080 --> 31:00.840
So if you are representing the world from within, and what you do is guided by what you expect to happen,

31:01.300 --> 31:03.920
you live in the regime of interference.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.880
Your expectations are meant to get, sorry, in their own way.

31:09.060 --> 31:09.880
That's what they're for.

31:11.040 --> 31:15.360
So the native position of the embedded agent is rife with interference.

31:15.700 --> 31:19.440
I'm looking into my future in a way that's centered on the here and now,

31:19.440 --> 31:23.480
and I'm in the regime of the sculptor, not of the predictor.

31:25.400 --> 31:32.160
Okay, so I'll close just by highlighting the little sort of gestalt shifts that all of this can induce

31:32.160 --> 31:35.660
when thinking about the role of intelligence in nature.

31:35.800 --> 31:41.540
So one was this idea that the natural purpose of representation isn't truth but interference.

31:41.540 --> 31:48.200
Another is really leaning into this idea that life and cognition aren't incidental byproducts

31:48.200 --> 31:51.320
of the mindless crunching of physical law.

31:52.640 --> 31:58.220
Not a way that you tend to think around here, but in the circles that I move in, it is.

31:59.300 --> 32:06.140
But rather that life and cognition are exploiting laws of physics to guide the flow of energy to their own ends.

32:06.140 --> 32:14.600
And finally, this is a little bit too cute, but the third has to do with that old familiar lesson about free will.

32:14.760 --> 32:20.380
So the idea still really has wide currency that determinism is supposed to reveal,

32:20.580 --> 32:23.500
that your sense of agency is illusory.

32:23.620 --> 32:26.640
So if you were faced with a demon that knew enough about your past,

32:26.680 --> 32:30.400
it could predict what you would do, and you would be powerless to do otherwise.

32:30.400 --> 32:38.280
So that's that death in Damascus division that you would do your best efforts to avoid what it predicted,

32:38.560 --> 32:42.560
and your efforts would themselves inevitably lead to your doing the thing.

32:43.060 --> 32:45.620
So what I've been arguing is that the opposite is truth.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.440
An aspiring demon is going to have to keep his prediction secret

32:49.440 --> 32:54.100
if the prediction is about you and your voluntary behavior,

32:54.340 --> 32:56.260
or you can use it against him.

32:56.260 --> 33:02.560
So the real lesson is not that avoidance is futile because prediction is possible,

33:02.560 --> 33:06.160
but that prediction is futile where avoidance is possible.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.600
Thank you.
