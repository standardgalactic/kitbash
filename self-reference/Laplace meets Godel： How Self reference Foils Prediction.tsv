0	9060	So thanks so much for having me here. I'm really, really happy to be here. It's kind of a magical place, even more than I imagined.
9660	24180	So the invitation asks for talk that would give you a sense of what I do. So I'm a philosopher of physics, so I think about lots of things like space, time, quantum mechanics, natural laws, the kinds of things that fall under the fold of philosophy of physics.
24180	33720	But I also think, as Marina said, about the big, squishy questions, the kinds of questions that all of the systematic philosophers of the past thought about.
33840	41180	So questions like, who are we? How do we fit into the architecture of the universe? What is life? What is mind? Is there free will?
41920	52620	These are questions that science confronts in its own way, and that often take a sharp and really kind of illuminating form in the setting of a mathematically articulated physical theory.
52620	64020	So what I'm going to do today, though, is I'm going to raise a really simple little puzzle and then talk my way through it that can cast some light on those kinds of big, squishy questions.
64360	71560	I'm going to warn you, though, that there are no equations, no numbers, and no data or experiments in my talk.
71560	75920	So don't throw any tomatoes at me. You invited me.
76960	86700	But I'm hoping that you'll see that the value of a little simple point can really change the way you think about things that you think already that you understand really well.
86700	103680	I'm happy to have you interrupt me if there's something that you don't understand, but I'll also tell you that I think you'll get the best out of me if you let me get it all out, kind of get the big picture out, because that will also help you decide which details matter.
103680	111600	And also because philosophers are words people, the kind of the words are chosen carefully, I will absolutely stop hard at 40 minutes.
111600	117920	So there will be lots of time for questions. But if there's something you don't understand, please feel free to stop me.
117920	127740	So there's a kind of big picture image of the universe that had a lot of currency in the 20th century, universe of particles obeying deterministic laws.
128320	136180	People now, of course, make concessions to our de facto ignorance and quantum mechanics, of course, has shaken this picture at the very foundation.
136640	143920	But the idea persists, I think, that at least in this kind of ideal setting, perfect prediction is in principle possible.
143920	153660	So Laplace gave us that sort of unshakable image of a demon that knows the positions and momenta of all of the particles of which universe is composed at the beginning of time.
154140	160540	And as he says, embraces in a single formula everything that will ever happen through the history of the universe.
160540	180100	So this big picture image of the universe, sorry, I would say that sort of image, of course, is really upsetting for our common sense conviction that if some demon came up to you and told you that you would, I don't know, raise your hand in a second from now, you could just flip them off.
180100	184560	Right. But you're supposed to just suck it up and say, OK, so we're wrong.
184660	187220	We've been wrong about plenty of things in the past.
187480	199940	I want to take this very simple deterministic setting and use it to bring into focus a kind of unpredictability that has nothing to do with determinism or ignorance and a lot to do with your ability to kind of flip off a demon.
200420	202340	If he tells you he knows what you will do.
202340	205880	So here's the puzzle that started me thinking about all of this.
205940	213440	So we have a theory, Newtonian mechanics, that says that a being that knew the initial conditions of the universe would be able to predict everything that happens.
213740	223700	Same theory lets us construct a device that would let us that would be designed to undermine any revealed prediction of what it would do.
224040	226460	So it wouldn't be hard to construct such a device.
226460	229220	We're imagining here a simple input output machine.
229420	232180	Maybe it has a light, a green light on top and a red light on top.
232340	238380	It takes predictions of its output in a particular form in a specified format and then does the opposite of what it's predicted.
238560	241460	So green light, if it's predicted, it will flash red and the opposite.
242100	242200	OK.
243140	250160	Now, if there could be a demon of the kind that Laplace describes, we could chain it together with this kind of device.
250920	254560	We give the demon access to all physically accessible information.
254680	258060	We let it make its calculation of the device's output.
258400	260320	We feed it into the device.
260320	262360	Now, what would happen here?
262360	267100	At least, what does classical mechanics say would happen here?
267100	271700	We don't have to fight about whether the device understands predictions.
272200	275720	We're just going to assume that the predictor understands predictions.
275720	282480	We'll let him use his language and fix the format of predictions and we'll design the device.
283100	283200	OK.
283200	287640	So all we have to suppose is that there's a fixed fact about what would count as a prediction being correct.
287640	290360	And then we'll construct the device.
290360	293440	So when it takes a prediction, what it will do in that form, it does the opposite.
293980	296860	If this is something that worries you, keep it in mind.
297280	299180	Prediction is a representational act.
299240	311420	So this puzzle only gets off ground if you're willing to naturalize representational activity and accept that there are at least beings in the world that represent and have semantic content to their utterances.
311420	324680	Now, in the early version of this puzzle, which comes out of a 1965 paper by Michael Scriven, what you have is a predictor and a counter predictive device, but they're not actually communicating with one another.
324680	327100	So they're each performing their own calculation.
327600	329020	A lot of people write papers.
329160	334060	There's all of this discussion about who out calculates who.
335040	344740	Then in a 2010 paper by Kuypers and Ruhmens, someone has this idea, what if we force the predictor to give its prediction to the counter predictive device?
344800	346840	And that sort of changes everything.
347040	352620	It's a really interesting move because it makes a good deal of the preceding discussion entirely irrelevant.
352620	354900	We don't have to talk about who calculates faster.
355220	359480	We don't even have to talk about how much information the device could have.
359780	360800	Calculation is irrelevant.
361000	366980	The counter predictive device just waits for the predictor to finish her calculation and then does the opposite.
367160	368980	She doesn't even need to know anything else.
370520	376280	So at this stage, it should be obvious, though, to the demon that the thing is rigged against him.
376280	383820	He can predict that any prediction he will make will be used to override his prediction.
385140	397900	Calculating isn't going to do him any good because his calculation will generate a piece of information that needs to be taken into account and that will override the result of his existing calculation and so on.
397900	411400	So the demon is trying to make a prediction, but the prediction is connected to what happens in such a way that when he tries to do the computation, he's coming up against the fact that his prediction is going to affect what he predicts.
411400	420120	So if you think of what the predictor is trying to do, he's effectively running a simulation of the evolution of the counter predictive device in his head.
420180	424120	So he's performing calculation or evolving forward a mental model.
424780	431540	He knows the output of his simulation is going to feed into the device and prompt a counter predictive response.
431540	439180	So as soon as he finishes the simulation, he needs to run the simulation with the new output, prompting a new simulation, a different output, and so on.
439480	442500	So his simulation has to include the result of his simulation.
442960	445920	And in that sense, he's never going to get ahead of himself.
446900	452820	So if he thinks about it hard enough, the predictor knows in advance that he's not going to get ahead.
453120	457860	Trying to generate an accurate prediction of what the device is doing is chasing his own shadow.
457860	468680	So you would encounter the same problem if you wanted to write a deterministic computer program that takes a prediction of its output and does the opposite.
470040	476580	Again, you wrote the thing, so there's no missing information and there's no indeterminism.
477320	483980	And still, if you trust the program, there's nothing you could learn, no information that you could have that's going to help.
483980	487260	You shouldn't put any money on predicting the output.
488940	490860	So what's going on here?
491500	496520	So if you think about this in physical terms, it's at least a prima facie of puzzling.
496920	504680	If the demon knows the initial conditions and the laws, he should be able to use those to generate a prediction with certainty.
505520	506760	Deductively, it should follow.
507460	513060	And yet he's faced with a situation where he knows that any prediction he makes is going to be used against him.
513060	516840	It's a losing game for him, and he can see that in advance.
518000	531780	So you might be looking here for ways to diffuse the problem by arguing, look, there are physical, there are practical bordering on in principle reasons that a calculation like this wouldn't be physically implementable.
531780	540900	So, for example, you might think it's impossible to know the initial conditions with perfect precision, impossible to carry out the computation in practical time, and so on.
540900	548900	But if all of those loopholes were closed, if you think about it, this is just like a closed causal loop.
548900	563080	And we can make the analogy explicit by realizing that advanced predictions of a Laplacian predictor that is an infallible predictor would be effectively proxies for the events themselves.
563080	573800	Since the demon predicts an event, if and only if it occurs, having an advanced prediction is just as good as having the event itself in its own past.
573860	577620	So you can rig up something that has the same form as a closed causal loop.
577700	580420	So here, closed causal loop takes E onto not E.
580420	592800	Here, you just have an advanced prediction with certainty connected to the thing that it's supposed to predict, and then leading causally to the thing, to the opposite of the thing.
593340	600160	So now, the analogy, once you have this analogy in mind, it makes it really tempting to reason this way.
600160	610880	Look, so long as the demon has done his calculations correctly, the counter-predictive device is going to have to end up doing what he predicts.
611180	616080	And that, of course, is the conclusion that many people have drawn from determinism.
616080	633700	They imagine that if there were a demon that knew enough about the past, and used it to predict what you would do, that you would, for example, raise your arm in five seconds, you might think that if he told you about it, you could refuse.
635720	639240	But unless he miscalculates, you're going to end up doing what he predicts.
639760	641280	It'll be like death in Damascus.
641280	648980	You'll try to avoid the fate that you're told you're going to encounter, and then your very efforts will somehow end up affirming the prediction.
649480	653840	An intelligence that knew enough about the past could use the loss to predict the future with certainty.
654020	659220	We're simply not going to succeed at doing anything other than what a demon like that predicts.
659500	661940	That's the only consistent solution, you might think.
662360	666860	And it's a familiar response to the grandfather paradoxes in the case of closed causal loops.
666860	677900	But then you think about this for a little while, and you realize there's a perfectly general argument, independently of the physics.
678400	683760	I'm going to call it the master argument, like obnoxiously, that that can't be right.
684240	690900	There could never have been a demon of the type that we're imagining, not in classical mechanics, not in any theory.
690900	700980	And probably some of you are already seeing it, looking at it sort of this way is going to turn the tables on the usual understanding of determinism.
701120	709260	I'm going to suggest and bring into focus what I said before, a source of unpredictability that has nothing to do with ignorance or indeterminism.
709640	711120	So here's the master argument.
714200	716040	So forget about demons for now.
716040	726760	Suppose we just want to program a computer to be our grand overarching database or repository of information, factual information about the physical world.
727040	731540	So we set about programming it with as much factual information as we have.
731620	740960	We program it with the laws of physics, all of the scientific knowledge we've amassed, facts we know about the history of the Earth, the monkeys of Costa Rica, and so on.
740960	750340	The goal is to be able to put to it any question of physical fact, any yes-no question of physical fact, and an answer will appear in the output channel.
751340	755520	Not hard to find a question, a physical fact that it can't answer.
755780	759300	Just ask, is the answer that's about to appear in the output channel? No.
762620	767960	So however it answers, it's going to be doing the opposite of what it says.
767960	775080	By saying things, right, so let me back up.
775440	777100	Think about this in physical terms.
777240	779800	So the computer is a physical system, right?
779980	786520	The question of what appears in its output channel is a question of physical fact, and yet it cannot answer truthfully.
787300	792740	Notice that the problem here, again, is not a lack of information, nor is it indeterminism.
792740	799660	And it's not just that you can't program the thing to answer correctly with certainty what it will do.
799800	805400	The system can't even accidentally guess the correct answer to this question.
805400	811920	And if you think about it in mechanical terms, it's very clear what's going on.
811920	813400	There's no paradox here.
813740	827100	What's going on is by saying things, the computer is doing things, and we can get a kind of interference between what it says, that is to say, the semantic content of the utterance, and what it does.
827100	843120	The act it performs in making that utterance, and in general, if one is dealing with a physical system that's in the business of representing the world, so it's making statements or forming beliefs about the world, and it falls under its own scope,
843120	857240	everything that it does, everything that it does is going to cast a shadow or register at the level of representation, at the semantic level, and every representational act is going to be connected in the domain that it's representing.
857520	862760	It's going to be part of the causal order, and there are going to be these kinds of interaction effects.
862760	873800	And what we've set things up here in the self-referential situation is that we've just set things up so that they're interfering negatively with one another.
875460	887860	So in the case we're describing, the computer can't stabilize the fact that it's meant to describe the word that appears on screen independently of giving the answer, the description that it gives,
887860	893200	and the thing is set up so that no matter what answer it gives, it's going to be doing the opposite.
893340	897020	The answer is going to conflict with what it says. That's what I mean by negative interference.
897920	902860	That's also what's going on with paradoxes of self-reference, and indeed with most semantic paradoxes.
905220	912380	So again, there's no actual paradox here. There are perfectly consistent ways the world can be.
912720	917380	The system can answer yes, it can answer no, it doesn't have to answer at all.
917380	921040	Those are all perfectly physically consistent ways the world can be.
921380	925060	It's just that whatever way it answers, it won't be speaking truly.
926440	933940	So the right response, right reaction to the puzzle here is not inconsistency in the world, it's incompleteness in representation.
934660	944100	So the thing has to maintain a kind of incompleteness in its representation on pain of inconsistency, not logical inconsistency, but inconsistency with fact.
944100	949880	Because it's going to be producing a fact that disagrees with what it's saying.
952820	961040	Interference, what I'm calling interference is just forcing into the open the fact that representational activity is part of the world,
961040	968420	and self-reference is going to arise naturally and inevitably for any system that's representing the world from the inside.
968760	972640	This is really what was behind the initial puzzle that I started with.
972640	980000	It was the self-reference that the demon encountered when he tried to perform his calculation that sent him into that paralyzing loop.
980440	989040	He goes to calculate the output of the counter predictive device, but he knows that the output of his calculation is going to feed into the device and prompt a counter response.
989040	995660	So as soon as he finishes the calculation, he needs to run it again without output, prompting a new calculation, and so on.
995940	1006460	So it was the self-reference that was implicit in the calculation that he was trying to run that was getting him fouled up in the negative interference that was arranged between what he was trying to predict and the prediction.
1006460	1018800	Now, the fact that you're going to run into interaction effects of your system in the world representing it is something that gets pushed out of view in most day-to-day physics.
1019260	1023960	Because in most day-to-day physics, one is modeling other systems, pendula, planets, gases.
1023960	1034400	We maintain a kind of provisional separation of subject, the thing doing the experiment, and the object, or investigator and the system being investigated.
1034980	1040380	Even when we're modeling ourselves, we're typically not modeling our own current representational activity.
1040380	1054960	But the people that have unavoidably encountered it, interestingly, are people that are, for example, trying to program an artificial general intelligence in a robot, so an embedded agent.
1055440	1064340	So they want to program a system with general knowledge and the ability to model the world, and they're coming up against the fact that there are going to be problems of self-reference.
1064340	1069560	Self-reference is usually, in that context, thought of as a pathology.
1069720	1080700	So you want to get as close to minimizing any disturbances that the computer or the agent's own activity has on the truth values of sentences in the field that it's representing.
1084800	1088420	But let me just point out that actually this is a familiar phenomenon.
1088860	1091700	So negative interference can arise in other ways.
1091700	1099140	So our government is trying to guess where a foreign army will attack, but they're tracking communications, and whatever we predict, they won't do.
1100040	1106060	Google Maps predicts traffic congestion in the east part of the city at lunchtime, and people avoid the area.
1107500	1110080	Positive interference arises as well.
1110200	1112640	So positive interference is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
1113180	1115240	Man's insecurity about keeping his commitment.
1115380	1116720	Shy lover drives her away.
1117120	1120440	More hilariously, I hope you've all seen these XKCDs.
1120440	1121440	Okay.
1121820	1133280	So any system that is keeping his commitment shot, sorry, any system that's acting in the domain that it's representing is going to encounter these kinds of interaction effects.
1133720	1138140	And they can interfere in complicated ways with peer knowledge acquisition.
1138140	1147140	If the system's own activity is part of the domain it's representing, there just are going to be interactions between what it says and what it does.
1147700	1149580	You can try to quarantine these effects.
1149940	1153500	But in any highly connected domain, it's going to be impossible.
1153760	1160360	There are going to be less direct effects because of the way that the system's behavior is connected in the wider domain.
1160360	1163680	So just consider, for example, the computer we were talking to.
1164400	1164500	Okay.
1164860	1170700	We can say, okay, so just don't answer questions about yourself and your own representational activity.
1170820	1175400	But what about questions like, will someone who looks at the answer to this question see the word no?
1175560	1182560	If the computer has a database that records its answers, will the database tomorrow or a year after show that the answer had been no?
1182560	1193060	If there's an internal counter that counts negative answers, triggers the launch of a rocket that knocks an asteroid off its course when it reaches a certain number, when will the rocket launch, right?
1193140	1197920	So it's going to be harder than you think to quarantine the effects here.
1197920	1210760	If there are causal connections between events in the domain, so that if the computer can transform an answer to one question into answers to others, there's going to be no simple way to contain the effects.
1210760	1219100	So this is mostly a kind of philosophical point, but philosophers often think about knowledge in this sort of detached way.
1219600	1232740	There are the way things are on the one hand, and there are representations of the way things are on the other, and truth is a kind of abstract, atemporal relation between your representations and the way things are.
1234120	1240180	What we forget is that knowledge is part of the world, and it makes a difference to what happens.
1241760	1249440	So interference is, I'm going to come back to that point in a minute, but interference is a familiar problem in some domains.
1249440	1258860	So an influential analyst predicts a fall in the value of the stock, prompting a sell-off, polls in an election made public, prompts strategic voting, and affect the outcome.
1259400	1271480	Anytime you have a prediction feeding back into the domain and affecting what it predicts, you have interference, and it's the paradox of predictability, that puzzle I started with, just on a larger scale.
1271480	1278480	When you see it this way, there's nothing confusing about it.
1278480	1294620	When you really naturalize representational activity, when you absorb it, that is to say, into the causal fabric of the universe, so you see that it plays a role in what happens, you recognize the possibility of these kinds of effects was there the whole time.
1294620	1303720	It was always going to be a delicate question, how your own representational activity was going to affect what you were trying to represent.
1303720	1308900	So there's a bunch of things that we can learn from this.
1308900	1321340	The first is that it brings into focus what I said before, a kind of unpredictability that isn't simply ignorant, so it's not remediated by having more information, and has nothing to do with indeterminism.
1321740	1325320	It has connections to the halting problem and to other puzzles of self-reference.
1325440	1336740	So if you think about the predictor, counter-predictor device, with the halting problem in mind, suppose you can solve the halting problem, then you can construct a machine that halts if and only if it doesn't halt.
1336740	1345980	Suppose there are a Laplacian predictor in the world, then you can construct a system that flashes a green light if and only if it's predicted that it flashes a green light.
1346260	1348020	Same form of the problem.
1349240	1355100	The second thing that you can learn is that it corrects a misunderstanding of the implications of determinism.
1355100	1374140	So this idea that has wide currency, certainly in philosophy and in the public imagination, that it's just our ignorance that makes us think that the future is open, that a direct confrontation with the predictor without our mundane implications would just dispel the illusion that the future has that kind of openness.
1374740	1378280	I think what this does is it sort of flips the script.
1378860	1380880	Prediction is hostage to interference.
1381740	1382740	Laplace was right.
1382740	1395460	What he said was a demon outside the universe with access to its total state could predict the future with certainty, but that's because its predictions aren't going to interfere with what happens.
1395500	1397600	It's not going to encounter these problems.
1398140	1410680	But for any system in the world, interference is going to, it will encounter interference, and interference is going to be an absolute limiting factor on what it can predict.
1410680	1419940	It's just like, as I said, if you try to write a deterministic computer program that takes a prediction of what it's going to do and does the opposite.
1422540	1430480	The fact that you know that's going to happen, that you can predict the failure of your own prediction, doesn't help predict correctly.
1430480	1439360	The fact that you have to keep your prediction secret to preserve its accuracy makes the point that interference defeats prediction.
1440320	1440440	Okay.
1440980	1449900	So there's a good physics question here about why, for example, classical mechanics doesn't furnish the in-principle possibility of an embedded demon.
1450320	1453520	Happy to talk about that if you want to in question and answer.
1453520	1464680	We know from the self-referential version of the argument that no theory tells you that there could be an embedded demon that can correctly answer all yes, no questions of fact about the world.
1464680	1477480	Quite generally, the way that you should think about this is if you take any set of consistent laws that allows the emergence of systems that use information to guide behavior and that represent the world from inside,
1477780	1486560	the laws will tell you where a particular system that is generating predictions and interacting with the environment, where it's going to encounter interference.
1486560	1500640	But what I want to do for the rest of the time, and I promised I would stop with lots of time for questions, is I want to emphasize two very different types of lessons.
1502000	1509680	One is I want to suggest that interference is the crack in the edifice of determinism that life and cognition exploit.
1509680	1519580	And then I want to sort of just point out that we, as systems that represent the world and use it to guide our behavior, we live in the regime of interference.
1520040	1523720	Our own experience of the world is organized around it.
1523720	1545880	So on the first point, what interference really does is it just brings into focus the fact that representational activity, gathering information, modeling the world, generating predictions is tangled up in the causal fabric of the world, and it makes a difference to what happens.
1545880	1557020	So that doesn't just mean that any system in the world that is doing these things will encounter interference as a kind of regrettable artifact of its embeddedness.
1557340	1559900	This is what representational activity is for.
1561040	1574480	In philosophy, as I said, we kind of talk about representation in that detached way, as though the goal of representation is truth, which is this timeless relation between the way things are and our representations.
1574480	1583360	As soon as you embed representational activity in the world, you realize that your mind isn't there to passively represent.
1584240	1587380	Representation is embodied activity, embedded creatures.
1588040	1591080	Its natural purpose is not truth, but interference.
1591920	1601560	The representational machinery in your head is guiding action in a way that works and is designed to work to offset predictions you don't like,
1601560	1612080	to counteract, support, obstruct, and otherwise get in the way of your own predictions, if you don't like them, and promote the ones that you do.
1612080	1615760	So think about these three different types of systems.
1616360	1620120	A rock rolling down a hill, magnetotactic bacteria.
1620260	1626800	These are bacteria that have organelles that contain magnetic crystals that keep them oriented towards magnetic north,
1626920	1630340	sort of guiding them towards nutrient-rich environments.
1630340	1634040	Or a frog that snaps out its tongue at a passing fly.
1634320	1636300	Or a person making a decision.
1636300	1643440	So look at, in the case of the rock, there's nothing of special interest that's kind of going on inside.
1643440	1650640	In the case of the frog snapping out its tongue, or the bacteria, these are evolved systems.
1651020	1660320	The internal machinery is using information to produce motor responses that allow the system to access free energy
1660320	1668940	and do what it needs to offset the entropic tendencies of the environment that would otherwise lead to the system's dissolution.
1669380	1678580	The logic of anticipating the future and then selecting responses that counteract or offset disfavored results
1678580	1682280	is kind of implicit in those cases in the system's design.
1682280	1693280	By the time you get to a person making a decision, the logic of anticipation and selecting responses to offset things that you don't like
1693280	1699060	is explicit as a computation that the system is carrying out in real time.
1699520	1704280	So we're running an internal simulation that assesses the impact of different behaviors
1704280	1708420	and uses the outputs of the simulation to guide behavior in a preferred direction.
1709420	1715460	And it's crucial to this arrangement, that the inner gears are engaging the outer machinery of the world
1715460	1720080	in a way that's designed to create counter-predictive interference.
1721440	1725860	So go back to the kind of the demon and the device.
1726420	1729280	So in that case, we had the predictor and the responder,
1729840	1733800	and the connection and the relationship between them was adversarial.
1734280	1736320	The predictor's goal was prediction.
1736480	1739140	The counter-predictive goal was FOIL prediction.
1739600	1741820	But if you ask yourself, what is the human mind?
1742700	1749680	It's effectively a system that generates prediction chained together with a counter-predictive device.
1750020	1753340	But here we replace prediction with the more general expectations.
1753900	1756880	So predictions take the form of a probability distribution,
1757460	1762020	where before we had two adversarial systems, one to predict and one to FOIL a prediction.
1762020	1763960	What if they work together?
1763960	1769440	And the job of the whole system, not unlike the Poulter or the analyst,
1769660	1775640	is not to achieve accuracy in its predictions, but rather a kind of selective inaccuracy.
1776040	1782140	The job of the responder is to curb predictions it doesn't like and to promote ones that it does.
1782140	1789580	So you can think of the system as a whole here as using what it knows and what it anticipates
1789580	1795640	to guide responses in a way strategically designed to shift the downstream probabilities
1795640	1798600	in a direction that it favors.
1799020	1800000	So how does this work?
1800520	1806000	Predictor uses information from the past to generate probability distribution over futures compatible with it.
1806000	1810020	Responder takes a distribution, conditionalizes on different choices,
1810520	1817480	and then makes the choices that maximizes expected utility or whatever your favorite decision rule is.
1817820	1818980	But what's going on here?
1819300	1825440	So I'm saying all of this just to show you that this actually has the form of the counter-predictive interference.
1825440	1833640	The responder is effectively using interference to sculpt the future by getting in the way of predictions it doesn't like
1833640	1836160	and behind ones that it does.
1836980	1847340	So our own experience of the world is organized around paradox of predictability type interference.
1848480	1852080	Paradox of predictability is just the name for that puzzle I started with.
1852080	1860840	So if you are representing the world from within, and what you do is guided by what you expect to happen,
1861300	1863920	you live in the regime of interference.
1864800	1868880	Your expectations are meant to get, sorry, in their own way.
1869060	1869880	That's what they're for.
1871040	1875360	So the native position of the embedded agent is rife with interference.
1875700	1879440	I'm looking into my future in a way that's centered on the here and now,
1879440	1883480	and I'm in the regime of the sculptor, not of the predictor.
1885400	1892160	Okay, so I'll close just by highlighting the little sort of gestalt shifts that all of this can induce
1892160	1895660	when thinking about the role of intelligence in nature.
1895800	1901540	So one was this idea that the natural purpose of representation isn't truth but interference.
1901540	1908200	Another is really leaning into this idea that life and cognition aren't incidental byproducts
1908200	1911320	of the mindless crunching of physical law.
1912640	1918220	Not a way that you tend to think around here, but in the circles that I move in, it is.
1919300	1926140	But rather that life and cognition are exploiting laws of physics to guide the flow of energy to their own ends.
1926140	1934600	And finally, this is a little bit too cute, but the third has to do with that old familiar lesson about free will.
1934760	1940380	So the idea still really has wide currency that determinism is supposed to reveal,
1940580	1943500	that your sense of agency is illusory.
1943620	1946640	So if you were faced with a demon that knew enough about your past,
1946680	1950400	it could predict what you would do, and you would be powerless to do otherwise.
1950400	1958280	So that's that death in Damascus division that you would do your best efforts to avoid what it predicted,
1958560	1962560	and your efforts would themselves inevitably lead to your doing the thing.
1963060	1965620	So what I've been arguing is that the opposite is truth.
1966000	1969440	An aspiring demon is going to have to keep his prediction secret
1969440	1974100	if the prediction is about you and your voluntary behavior,
1974340	1976260	or you can use it against him.
1976260	1982560	So the real lesson is not that avoidance is futile because prediction is possible,
1982560	1986160	but that prediction is futile where avoidance is possible.
1987600	1988600	Thank you.
