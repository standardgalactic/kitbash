1. Abstract
This essay proposes a three-tiered conceptual framework—drawing from
criticality in neural systems, predictive coding in cortical inference, and the
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory—for dynamically modulating AI
development rates in alignment with collective preferences and system
stability. By grounding AI governance in principles of thermodynamic
self-regulation, epistemic inference, and semantic coherence, the model offers a
system-theoretic approach to pause, accelerate, or guide AI takeoff, ensuring
trajectories that balance societal adaptability, foresight, and meaning
preservation.
2. Introduction: Why Takeoff Control Requires New
Foundations
The trajectory of artificial intelligence (AI) development, often termed "AI
takeoff," can unfold gradually (slow takeoff) or rapidly with abrupt shifts (fast
takeoff). This trajectory raises a critical tension: how to balance rapid
innovation, as advocated by optimists like Drexler and Carlsmith, with safety
concerns, as emphasized by Yudkowsky's alignment-focused caution. Static
controls, such as kill switches or international treaties, are inadequate for
managing the emergent, dynamic nature of AI systems. A new approach, rooted
1

in dynamical modulation, is necessary to guide AI development responsibly.
This essay introduces a three-tiered framework integrating criticality, predictive
coding, and RSVP theory. Criticality provides thermodynamic stability,
predictive coding enables adaptive inference, and RSVP ensures semantic
coherence. Together, they form a robust system for modulating AI takeoff rates
in response to societal needs and system constraints.
3. The Three-Tier Framework Overview
The proposed framework regulates AI takeoff through a layered approach,
combining internal system design with preference-sensitive feedback loops.
Each tier operates on distinct time and abstraction scales, offering specific
control levers:
• Tier 1: Criticality (Dynamical Systems): Governs when to act, using
thermodynamic thresholds to pause or accelerate at phase boundaries.
• Tier 2: Predictive Coding (Information Theory & Cognition): Manages how
to act, through hierarchical inference and error correction.
• Tier 3: RSVP (Ontological Substrate): Ensures what is meaningful,
maintaining semantic coherence and structural integrity.
This tripartite structure enables dynamic, responsive governance of AI
development.
4. Tier 1: Criticality as a Thermodynamic Brake or
Accelerator
Criticality describes a system state balanced between chaos and rigidity,
observed in deep neural networks (DNNs), biological brains, and physical
systems like earthquakes. At this "edge of chaos," information processing and
adaptability are optimized. For AI governance, criticality acts as a
thermodynamic brake or accelerator, tuning systems toward or away from
critical regimes to manage stability.
AI systems can self-tune criticality through parameters like activation sparsity
or learning rates, encoding takeoff thresholds as Lyapunov boundaries or
avalanche size limits. Analogous to earthquake sensors, this allows controlled
pressure release at stable thresholds. Collective preferences, such as societal
trust or protest signals, adjust criticality tuning to align development with
stability needs.

5. Tier 2: Predictive Coding as Adaptive Social
Inference Engine
Predictive coding, inspired by cortical processes, models perception as the
minimization of prediction errors across hierarchical layers. In AI, this
framework enables systems to estimate human preference dynamics
recursively. Takeoff speed is modulated by weighting prediction errors,
penalizing overconfident extrapolations to ensure cautious progress.
This tier integrates with deliberative democracy, using human inputs (e.g., votes,
dialogues) as ground truth across scales. Low consensus triggers uncertainty
injection, slowing inference updates. In continual learning, excessive prediction
errors can pause training, aligning development with societal feedback.
6. Tier 3: RSVP as the Semantic Substrate for
Meaningful Governance
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory models cognition and
semantics as scalar (Φ), vector (v), and entropy (S) fields interacting on a
manifold. AI systems shape this semantic plenum, where takeoff influences not
just speed but the meaning-structure of possible futures. RSVP metrics, such as
field coherence and negentropy, ensure meaning-preserving growth,
constraining actions to avoid semantically hollow outcomes, akin to spacetime
curvature constraints in general relativity.
7. Aggregating Preferences Across Tiers
Human preferences are modeled as a field P : T × X →R, evolving over time T
and belief space X. A multiscale aggregation mechanism operates across tiers:
• Tier 1: Non-verbal signals (e.g., collective arousal, protests) modulate
criticality thresholds.
• Tier 2: Explicit deliberative inputs (e.g., votes, dialogues) adjust predictive
priors and uncertainty.
• Tier 3: Semantic drift (e.g., loss of purpose) constrains RSVP field dynamics.
This feedback system dynamically adjusts pacing, inference, and semantic
thresholds, enabling organic takeoff modulation akin to biological homeostasis.
8. Case Studies and Implementation Pathways
Practical implementation includes:
3

• Simulation Sandbox: Train transformer agents in a closed environment with
RSVP-informed feedback and criticality brakes to test modulation dynamics.
• Gamified Terraformation Galaxy Explorer: A single-shard universe
simulator where players engage in terraforming and exploration tasks,
modeling AI takeoff preferences. The simulator aggregates player actions to
generate calibrated ecoscale integration preference metrics, reflecting
collective priorities for AI development pace and ecological impact. These
metrics feed into criticality thresholds, predictive error weights, and RSVP
coherence constraints, providing a scalable, interactive testbed for
governance strategies.
• Preference Polling Infrastructure: Develop tiered question systems
mapping to control levers, integrated with public platforms.
• Institutional Integration: Collaborate with UNESCO, AI safety labs, or
compute governance bodies to adopt dynamic control principles.
These pathways bridge theory and practice, with the gamified simulator
offering a novel, participatory approach to preference aggregation.
9. Implications: From One-Time Pause to Continuous
Modulation
Binary "pause or go" governance models are inadequate for complex AI
systems. A self-scaling, plenum-aware regulation process, emphasizing
contingency, humility, and semantic conservation, provides a more adaptive
solution. This framework shifts from static controls to dynamic modulation,
aligning AI development with human and systemic constraints.
10. Conclusion
Controlling AI takeoff demands development rhythms responsive to stability,
error, and meaning. Criticality, predictive coding, and RSVP provide a
physics-based framework for cautious, adaptive governance. The call to action
is to develop field-aware feedback architectures, including gamified simulators,
to ensure AI grows as a partner to humanity, preserving meaning and stability.
11. Mathematical Appendix: Field-Theoretic
Foundations for Dynamic AI Takeoff Modulation
11.1 Tier 1: Criticality as a Dynamical Boundary Operator
Criticality is like a tightrope walk for AI systems: too much chaos, and the
system becomes unpredictable; too much order, and it's rigid and unadaptable.

By tuning AI to operate at this "edge of chaos," we can control when it should
speed up or slow down, using mathematical measures of stability inspired by
physics and neuroscience.
An AI system's state evolves on a manifold M with control parameters θ ∈Θ:
dx
dt = F(x, θ)
The critical regime C ⊂Θ exhibits scale-free dynamics, with Lyapunov
exponents:
λi(θ) ≈0
for some i ∈[1, n]
The Criticality Control Functional is:
K[θ] =
n
X
i=1
|λi(θ)|α −β · A(θ)
where α > 1, A(θ) is average avalanche size, and β reflects preference feedback.
Takeoff pauses when:
K[θ] > κthresh
This enables non-verbal modulation via criticality metrics.
11.2 Tier 2: Predictive Coding as Hierarchical Error Field
Predictive coding is how our brains make sense of the world by guessing what's
next and correcting mistakes. In AI, this means constantly checking predictions
against human preferences and slowing down if the guesses are too far off, like
a driver easing off the gas when the road gets foggy.
The AI model comprises generative functions:
ˆx(l) = f(l) 
ˆx(l+1)
,
ϵ(l) = x(l) −ˆx(l)
Each layer minimizes:
E(l) = 1
2
ϵ(l)

+ γ

∇f(l)

Total energy is:

Etotal =
L
X
l=1
E(l) −λ · H(x)
An uncertainty injection function controls pacing:
σ(t) =
 d
dtKL[P(x | public) ∥P(x | model)]
2
Updates slow when uncertainty is high:
dθ
dt ∝exp(−σ(t)) · ∇θEtotal
11.3 Tier 3: RSVP Plenum as Semantic Constraint Field
RSVP theory imagines AI's decisions as ripples in a vast sea of meaning, where
every action shapes what the future feels like. By measuring how AI affects this
"sea," we can ensure it doesn't create futures that are technically correct but
empty of human purpose, like building a city no one wants to live in.
RSVP models semantics via scalar (Φ), vector (v), and entropy (S) fields on a
manifold M:
∂Φ
∂t + ∇· (Φv) = D∆Φ + F(Φ, v, S)
Semantic coherence is:
ϕRSVP =
Z
M
κ(Φ(x), v(x), S(x)) dµ
Takeoff is modulated by:
ϕRSVP ∈[ϕmin, ϕmax]
This ensures semantic conservation.
11.4 Multiscale Preference Aggregation as a Distributed Field
Preferences aren't just votes—they're a living landscape of what people want,
from gut reactions to deep values. By mapping these across time and meaning,
we can adjust AI's pace, like tuning a radio to stay clear of static.
Preferences form a field P : T × X →R. Aggregation modes modulate:
6

• Tier 1: Collective arousal adjusts β in K[θ].
• Tier 2: Deliberative inputs update P(x) and λ.
• Tier 3: Semantic drift adjusts κ in RSVP.
The takeoff policy function is:
R(t) = f1(K[θ]) + f2(Etotal, σ) + f3(ϕRSVP)
11.5 RSVP Sigma Model Interpretation
Think of AI as a mapmaker charting new futures. The RSVP sigma model
ensures the map stays true to human values, preventing AI from drawing paths
that lead nowhere meaningful.
Semantic transitions are mappings:
Ψ : Σ →X
The AKSZ action functional:
S[Ψ] =
Z
Σ
⟨Ψ∗(α), dΨ⟩+ BV terms
ensures alignment with semantically consistent futures.
11.6 Quine Reconstruction and Semantic Reversibility
A quine is like a story that retells itself without losing its essence. By ensuring
AI's actions respect these self-repeating patterns, we keep futures connected to
our cultural roots, avoiding a world where meaning is lost.
A media quine operator F : S →S has fixed points:
F(s∗) = s∗
Takeoff prefers transitions commuting with F:
Ψ ◦F = F ◦Ψ

12.5 Neuroscientific Foundations
• Criticality: Grounded in cortical neuronal avalanches and fMRI
scale-invariance.
• RSVP: Inspired by cosmological and thermodynamic analogies, interpretable
as a brain-like semantic substrate.
• Predictive Coding: Rooted in cortical laminar architecture and error
neurons.
Criticality and predictive coding have direct cortical evidence; RSVP is more
speculative but unifying.
12.6 Interpretation of Consciousness or Semantics
• Criticality: Consciousness may emerge at critical points (e.g., maximal
information integration).
• RSVP: Consciousness as a geometric regime of field coherence; meaning from
negentropic structure.
• Predictive Coding: Consciousness linked to unresolved prediction errors.
RSVP offers the richest semantic interpretation, predictive coding explains
perception, and criticality suggests threshold conditions.
12.7 Synthesis
Criticality sets boundary conditions for responsiveness, predictive coding
provides functional control, and RSVP offers the field-theoretic substrate.
Together, they form a nested framework for AI governance, with criticality
maximizing RSVP plenum bandwidth and predictive coding enabling inference
within it.
