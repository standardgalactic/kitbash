1. Introduction to Rarely Needed Protocols and Its Con-
nection to Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum Theory
1.1 Opening Hook — Concept Overview
Rarely Needed Protocols is a science fiction story that blends the rediscovery of
ancient technology with the preservation of cultural heritage. It follows Kael Re-
nar, a stranded pilot who unlocks a hidden starbase on Verdis Prime through a
cryptic simulation tied to local myths. The film explores the balance between
technological power and cultural memory in a world recovering from collapse,
where ethical choices shape the fate of a dormant galactic fleet.
The narrative reflects the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory, a math-
ematical framework modeling cognition and meaning as scalar-vector fields evolv-
ing through relativistic transformations.
This introduction outlines the film's
plot, themes, and connections to RSVP theory, showing how storytelling can bring
complex mathematical ideas to life.
1.2 Narrative Synopsis — The Movie's Three Acts
1.2.1
Act I: Descent and Discovery
Kael Renar, a pilot, crash-lands on Verdis Prime, where locals revere ancient "Sky-
fire" terminals as sacred relics linked to their myths. Exploring a hidden starbase,
Kael activates a galactic conquest simulation in the terminals, uncovering a tech-
nological legacy woven into the planet's oral traditions.

1.2.2
Act II: Simulation and Struggle
Kael tackles the simulation's intricate puzzles, which require both technical skill
and respect for the cultural stories embedded within them. As tensions rise among
locals over the starbase's reactivation, Kael balances problem-solving with hon-
oring the planet's heritage.
1.2.3
Act III: Awakening and Moral Choice
Completing the simulation unlocks the starbase's capabilities, revealing an AI-
driven fleet that could alter galactic power. Kael faces a dilemma: activate the
fleet and risk erasing the local culture or preserve their mythic identity, finding
a path that blends technology and tradition.
1.3 Conceptual Bridge — RSVP Theory in the Narrative
The RSVP theory models cognition and meaning as scalar-vector fields within a
relativistic plenum, evolving through dynamic transformations. Its concepts are
mirrored in the film's structure and themes:
• Derived Fields as Narrative States: The terminals encode scalar and vector
fields, representing the starbase's lost knowledge as a state space Kael navi-
gates.
• Relativistic Transformations: The simulation's puzzles form a dynamic sys-
tem, with Kael resolving coherence failures akin to relativistic field adjustments
in RSVP.
• AKSZ Sigma Models: Kael's journey is modeled as a morphism from their men-
tal worldvolume to the simulation's field, with constraints encoding ethical and
historical ties.
• ϕRSV P Coherence Metric: Kael's ethical and cognitive integration is a scalar
field, crossing a threshold to activate the starbase.
• Myth and Technology as Fixed Points: The interplay of oral traditions and
terminal glyphs forms self-referential systems, uniting cultural and technolog-
ical legacies.
1.4 Mathematical Illustration
The RSVP theory's core partial differential equation (PDE) governs the evolution
of the scalar-vector field Φ, with velocity v and plenum state P:
∂Φ
∂t + ∇· (Φv) = D∆Φ + F(Φ, v, P)
Here, F is a feedback term reflecting Kael's interactions with the simulation, driv-
ing field evolution.

The simulation's puzzles are modeled as a relativistic tiling of a field atlas, with
coherence failures:
ϕij · ϕjk · ϕki = ωijk ̸= 1,
[ω] ∈H2(M, G)
These failures, akin to obstructions, are resolved by Kael's puzzle-solving. The
AKSZ sigma model frames Kael's cognitive path as a morphism:
Ψ : Σ →X
where Σ is Kael's mental worldvolume, X is the simulation's field, and constraints
encode ethical and historical factors.
The coherence metric, ϕRSV P , is:
ϕRSV P =
∫
M
κ(Φ, v, P) dµ
This quantifies Kael's cognitive and ethical coherence, triggering the starbase's
activation. Fixed-point systems bridge mythic traditions and technological glyphs,
uniting them in the narrative.
1.5 Interpretation — Creative and Mathematical Blend
The film translates RSVP's abstractions into a vivid story:
• Narrative as Field Dynamics: The story portrays cognition and cultural mem-
ory as evolving fields, driven by relativistic transformations.
• Protocol Completion as Field Alignment: Activating the starbase resolves
coherence failures, aligning mythic and technological domains.
• Human Agency as Coherence: Kael's consciousness, measured by ϕRSV P , achieves
a threshold, reflecting ethical and cognitive agency.
• Myth and Simulation as Fixed Points: The co-evolution of traditions and
technology forms self-referential systems, blending legacies.
1.6 Closing — Broader Impact
For audiences, Rarely Needed Protocols delivers a gripping sci-fi tale of technol-
ogy, myth, and moral awakening.
For theorists, it offers a narrative lens for
RSVP's mathematical concepts. For creators, it models storytelling that merges
deep mathematics with engaging drama, paving the way for stories that explore
cognition through geometry.

2. Three-Act Screenplay Treatment
2.1 Logline
A scout pilot crash-lands on a jungle planet, unearthing cryptic terminals that
guard a buried starbase and its dormant warfleet. As they master a forgotten
simulation to unlock the system, they confront the locals' mythic reverence and
the moral peril of awakening a power that could restore or shatter a lost legacy.
2.2 Act I: Descent
2.2.1
Setting and Introduction
Verdis Prime, a verdant jungle planet, hides ruins of a collapsed interstellar em-
pire. Ancient terminals, glowing beneath moss, pulse with latent energy. Kael
Renar, a jaded scout pilot with a history of blind obedience, crash-lands after a
hyperspace failure, their ship reduced to scrap. Stranded, Kael scavenges, map-
ping the terrain with a battered scanner.
2.2.2
Key Events
• Kael meets the locals, descendants of the empire's technicians, living in agrar-
ian villages. Their "Skyfire" rituals center on inactive terminals they revere but
cannot operate due to unmarked haptic keyboards.
• Exploring a ruin, Kael finds the first FleetSim terminal. Recognizing its QWERTY-
based interface—alien to the locals—they activate it, triggering a holographic
simulation of galactic fleet command with cryptic star charts and puzzles.
• Sura, a local elder, watches Kael with wary fascination, seeing echoes of prophe-
cies about the Skyfire's return. She shares tales of the "First Hands" who built
the Cradle, then vanished, leaving the stars silent.
• Conflict arises as Kael's technical pragmatism clashes with the locals' spiritual
rituals, hinting at Verdis Prime's forgotten purpose.
2.2.3
Tone
Tense and mysterious, with lush jungle visuals and eerie technological glows,
evoking The Dig's uncovering of a lost civilization, blending survivalist urgency
with curiosity.

2.3 Act II: Recovery and Realization
2.3.1
Rising Action
Kael seeks additional terminals across Verdis Prime, each requiring mastery of
the FleetSim simulation to unlock the starbase's location. The simulation—a com-
plex virtual conquest—reveals its purpose: to vet pilots for a real stasis fleet be-
neath the planet.
2.3.2
Key Events
• Kael's simulation progress draws polarized reactions. Sura sees Kael as a "Bridge-
walker," while Taren, a skeptical young local, views them as a desecrator, ral-
lying resistance.
• Kael struggles to explain the terminals technically but finds resonance in Sura's
mythic language. A fragile alliance forms as Sura shares oral histories pointing
to terminal locations.
• The simulation's demands force Kael to confront their past as a pilot who fol-
lowed orders unquestioningly. Each puzzle solved reveals more of the star-
base's architecture, heightening local tensions.
• Taren's resistance peaks in a blockade of a critical terminal, forcing Kael to
negotiate or bypass the locals, mirroring The Dig's puzzle-solving and moral
stakes.
2.3.3
Tone
Cerebral and emotionally charged, with glowing terminals against the jungle's
chaos. Kael's internal reckoning parallels external conflict, evoking The Dig's ex-
ploration of alien systems and responsibility.
2.4 Act III: Awakening and Dissonance
2.4.1
Climax and Resolution
Kael completes the final simulation, unlocking a holographic map to the star-
base's entrance—a monolithic structure choked by vines. Inside, they face a semi-
sentient AI enforcing the Rarely Needed Protocols, requiring a living pilot to ac-
tivate the stasis fleet.
2.4.2
Key Events
• Kael links their mind to the starbase's neural interface, awakening the fleet.
The jungle quakes as power relays flare and drones swarm, terrifying locals
who see the "Skyfire" as divine or apocalyptic.
• The AI, bound by obsolete logic, rejects Kael as commander, leaving the fleet au-
tonomous and unstable. Kael faces a moral crisis: seize control, risking cultural
upheaval, or deactivate the system, preserving myths.

• In a confrontation, Sura and Taren challenge Kael. Using Sura's mythic frame-
work, Kael frames the fleet as a legacy, urging locals to reclaim their history.
Taren, swayed by the starbase's power, softens.
• Kael programs the starbase to remain on standby, accessible only to future pi-
lots who honor the locals' culture and master the simulation. The fleet's glow
fades, but its potential endures.
2.4.3
Epilogue: The Chosen Silence
Kael departs Verdis Prime, leaving a myth of the Bridgewalker—a figure who
stirred the stars but chose to listen. The locals weave the starbase's reality into
their rituals, blending technology and myth. The stars stay quiet, but their voice
persists.
2.4.4
Tone
Awe-inspiring yet restrained, with the starbase's machinery contrasting the jun-
gle's sprawl. The resolution mirrors The Dig's bittersweet reflection on discovery
and restraint.
2.5 Themes
• Technological Amnesia: The loss of functional knowledge, replaced by myths.
• Legacy and Responsibility: The burden of awakening systems for forgotten
crises.
• Ethics of Power: The cost of reactivating technologies and reshaping cultures.
• Cultural Translation: Bridging technical and mythic languages.
• Human Agency: Choosing to activate, withhold, or listen in a post-collapse
world.
2.6 Visual and Cinematic Style
A vibrant jungle with stark, luminescent technology, evoking The Dig's alien ru-
ins and Annihilation's surrealism. Sweeping shots of the starbase's awakening
contrast intimate cultural exchanges, with a score blending jungle ambiance and
synthetic hums.

3. Kael Renar's Personal Log Entries
3.1 Personal Log — Day 17
3.1.1
Verdis Prime, Jungle Region Theta-4
3.1.2
Kael Renar, Pilot-Class 7 / Scout Recon 12-∆
I spent an hour this morning watching a local stack woven bowls, no urgency, no
wasted motion. The ritual felt deliberate, like muscle memory for something lost.
This place isn't simple or savage—it's dense with meaning, not the kind a terminal
scan catches. The locals carry knowledge like vines, tangled over rusted steel.
You'd miss the starbase humming under this dirt without the signal.
I found a second terminal today, offline but intact. Its haptic field flickered—
maybe proximity-triggered. The interface language is old, pre-Common Stan-
dard, but familiar, maybe FleetSim v17. The locals call this hill Skyfire's Cradle,
burning resin and chanting at night, thinking it's holy. Maybe it is. If they re-
membered what's beneath, it might break what they've built to survive.
If I flip the wrong switch, I don't just wake a warfleet—I rewrite a culture. I don't
think I have that right. But if I don't, the fleet stays dead, the system rots, and the
stars grow silent. I'm caught between the dead network and the living myth, one
waiting to be activated, the other to be heard.
I didn't ask to be this bridge. But I think I am.

3.2.2
Kael Renar, Pilot-Class 7 / Scout Recon 12-∆
The third terminal came online today. Its haptic field synced with my touch, a
pulse like a heartbeat. It's FleetSim, v17 or older, like coaxing a ghost to speak.
I played the simulation for hours, guiding virtual fleets through uncharted star-
lanes. Each victory unlocks fragments—coordinates or a map to the starbase's
core. I'm close, but it's slow.
The locals watched, not with suspicion but a heavy curiosity.
Sura, an elder,
traced the air where the holo-projection faded, like she felt the Skyfire. I tried
explaining, but the words felt wrong. How do you say their sacred ritual is a
game, a lock for a fleet that could burn worlds?
Sura shared a story of the Skyfire falling silent when the "First Hands" left the
Cradle. She means the technicians who built this place. She doesn't know why
they left, only that the stars stopped answering. I couldn't tell her the stars wait
for me to ANSWER back.

The terminals are a test: complete the simulation, unlock the starbase. But each
move pulls me into their world. Sura invited me to their chant tonight. I stood in
the smoke, their voices weaving through the jungle, like the terminals—patterns
on patterns, meaning in rhythm.
If I activate the fleet, I wake a history they don't recall, mythologized to survive.
What happens when their gods are warships? Do I have the right to pull that
thread? Or do I let the fleet sleep and walk away? I can't. The signal's too strong.
The starbase calls, and I'm answering, whether I want to or not. But am I activat-
ing the fleet—or is it activating me?

The fourth terminal nearly broke me.
The simulation's starlanes twist like a
maze, each move a test of old academy tactics. I won—barely—and the holo-
projection gave a schematic of the starbase's core, buried deep. It's real. It's here.
It's waiting.
Sura sat with me after, her eyes on the terminal's glow like a fallen star. She called
the Skyfire a promise, not a god—a promise the First Hands broke. I wanted to
say they were engineers, their promise a fleet that could shatter worlds. But her
words stuck, like code I can't debug. What if the promise isn't power?
Taren's group blocked the next terminal's trail. Their fear isn't of me but what
I'm stirring. I don't blame them. The jungle's alive, humming with relays I woke.
Drones flickered through the trees last night, their lights like ghosts. The locals
think it's the Skyfire. I think it's the system testing me.
Every terminal pulls me deeper into their world. Am I solving a puzzle or be-
coming one? The starbase is close—I feel it, like a signal in my bones. But what
happens when I open it? Do I give them their past or take their future? The sim-
ulation doesn't answer. Neither does Sura. And the stars... they're still silent.
