The numbers in the filenames are the context length in lines.
20, 80, are almost completely useless, as they contain a lot of hallucinations and errors.
400 works well enough.

I ran "OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=16384 ollama serve" before running the script.

Rarely Needed Protocols: Myth, Technology, and Moral Choice

The provided texts introduce the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory, a framework proposing that cognition and meaning are represented by interacting scalar, vector, and entropy fields.

"Configuration Space.pdf" explores how RSVP, enhanced by the TARTAN recursion engine, the Aletheos Canonical Form (ACF), and Universal Emergence Theory (UET), reinterprets cosmology as a timeless, recursive curve through configuration space, where time emerges internally from entropic and recursive changes.

"Controlled AI Takeoff.pdf" applies RSVP within a three-tiered framework alongside criticality and predictive coding to dynamically modulate AI development rates, ensuring semantic coherence and alignment with collective preferences.

Lastly, "Rarely Needed Protocols.pdf" presents a science fiction narrative that translates RSVP's abstract concepts into a story about reawakening ancient technology and navigating moral choices to preserve cultural memory through field transformations and coherence metrics.

Societal Mesh Organs: Civilizational Memory Infrastructure

The provided texts collectively present a vision for advanced computational and societal systems, often integrating the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP), a theoretical framework modeling reality through scalar, vector, and entropy fields.

"Caldera-Reactor.pdf" describes a novel system for converting biomass into biocrude using a lift-press-vacuum cycle, leveraging AI and biological components, while "Distributed Harmonic Field Sensing.pdf" details a network of phase-synchronized sensor nodes for detecting extremely low frequency (ELF) fields.

"Mathematical Structures.pdf" and "RSVP-ADAPTER.pdf" thoroughly explicate the RSVP framework's mathematical underpinnings and its applications in modeling cognition, emotion, and analogical reasoning, including how emotions are viewed as field reconfigurations rather than pressure.

Furthermore, "Controlled AI Takeoff.pdf" proposes a three-tiered control system for AI development based on criticality, predictive coding, and RSVP, and "Playcosm.pdf" conceptualizes a "single-shard universe" where play functions as a simulation of institutional ecosystems, influenced by "privilege gates."

Finally, "Rarely Needed Protocols.pdf" illustrates the RSVP theory through a science fiction narrative, and "Unified Active Inference Framework.pdf" formalizes a hierarchical predictive coding model across various domains, while "Readability.pdf" argues for open-source computational tools like Python over proprietary alternatives.
