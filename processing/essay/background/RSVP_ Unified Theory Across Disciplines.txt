\begin{abstract}
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) proposes a three-field substrate---scalar capacity $\Phi$, vector flow $v$, and entropy $S$---that unifies descriptions of cosmology, cognition, computation, and semantic systems. RSVP reframes gravitational redshift as an entropic path integral, neural dynamics as PDEs driven by entropy and negentropic flows, replicator dynamics as RSVP-modulated gradient systems, and semantic infrastructures as sheaf-theoretic gluing constrained by entropy budgets. What first appeared as protocol encodings can thus be interpreted as a consistent mathematical framework with BV/AKSZ closure. We survey cosmological tests, neural models, semantic operators, ethical implications, and governance strategies under entropic constraints.

\section{Introduction}

The aspiration to develop a unified framework that spans cosmology, cognition, and computation is not new, but it has become increasingly urgent as distinct domains of theory begin to display overlapping structures. The drive to unify arises from the recognition that all three domains---physical spacetime, neural dynamics, and informational or computational processes---share a common reliance on entropic regulation, scalar capacities, and vectorial flows. To treat them separately risks missing the deeper substrate in which they are embedded.  

Mainstream approaches have already laid much of the groundwork. In cosmology, the idea that gravitational dynamics can be derived from thermodynamic and entropic principles has been explored extensively \cite{Jacobson:1995ab,Verlinde:2010hp,Padmanabhan:2009vy,Carney2022}. These works interpret spacetime geometry not as a primitive structure but as an emergent consequence of entropy gradients and horizon thermodynamics. In neuroscience and cognitive science, predictive processing and the free-energy principle \cite{Friston:2009ze,Hohwy2013,ParrPezzuloFriston2022} posit that brains maintain their integrity by minimizing surprise or prediction error, operationalized through variational free-energy functionals. In engineering and systems theory, cybernetics has long emphasized feedback, stability, and entropy-based measures of regulation and control \cite{Wiener1948,Ashby1956}.  

The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework aims to generalize these insights by positing a minimal continuum composed of three irreducible fields: a scalar capacity $\Phi$ representing potential density, a vector field $v$ encoding directed negentropic flow, and an entropy field $S$ capturing gradients of disorder and reorganization. In doing so, RSVP proposes that the same mathematical structures can govern cosmological redshift, neural dynamics, semantic communication, and the ethical management of entropy in socio-technical systems.  

At the mathematical level, RSVP connects naturally to developments in higher geometry. The Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky (AKSZ) construction \cite{Alexandrov:1995kv} provides a sigma-model framework for encoding fields and their interactions, while shifted symplectic geometry \cite{Pantev:2011ns} and the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism \cite{BatalinVilkovisky1981} ensure closure of the algebra of observables. From an informational perspective, RSVP extends classical results on entropy and information---from Shannon's foundational theory of communication \cite{Shannon1948} to Landauer's principle on the thermodynamic cost of erasure \cite{Landauer1961,Bennett1982} and the modern synthesis in information theory \cite{CoverThomas2006}---into a field-theoretic setting.  

Historically, the intellectual lineage of RSVP also draws on work in complexity and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures \cite{Prigogine1980} demonstrated how entropy production can paradoxically give rise to order, while Haken's synergetics \cite{Haken1983} developed the mathematics of self-organization in nonlinear systems. These insights, together with advances in synergetic neural modeling, provide strong evidence that entropy, far from being a force of decay alone, is the generative principle by which structure emerges across scales. Complexity science more broadly has shown that such principles recur across domains ranging from physics to biology to social systems \cite{Smolin2019,Levin2022}.  

From a philosophical standpoint, RSVP resonates with Ortega y Gasset's notion of life as a project under constraint \cite{Ortega1930}, Jaynes's program of entropic inference \cite{Jaynes2003}, and Dennett's multiple-drafts model of consciousness \cite{Dennett1991}. It suggests that ethics, cognition, and cosmology can all be reformulated as problems of navigating entropic budgets within structured fields. Thus, the central claim of RSVP is that what appear as disparate theories---entropic gravity, predictive brains, and cybernetic feedback loops---are in fact different projections of a single tripartite field system. This motivates a systematic development of RSVP as a continuum substrate, with applications ranging from cosmology to cognition, artificial intelligence, semantic infrastructures, and normative governance.

\section{The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum}

The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) is defined as a tripartite continuum field theory in which three irreducible components interact:  

\begin{align}
\Phi &: \text{a scalar capacity field, representing density, potential, or storage of latent possibility}, \\
v &: \text{a vector field encoding directed currents of negentropy or organized flow}, \\
S &: \text{an entropy field representing gradients of disorder, dissipation, and reorganization}.
\end{align}

These three fields form the minimal basis for encoding dynamical processes across scales. Whereas $\Phi$ represents capacity or "reservoirs of possibility," $v$ represents directed agency-like flows, and $S$ represents the entropic costs that arise whenever order is established or maintained. Taken together, they allow RSVP to describe phenomena ranging from cosmological redshift to cortical regulation and semantic communication.

\subsection{Action Functional and Variational Structure}
The coupled dynamics of the RSVP fields are governed by an action-like free-energy functional:
\begin{equation}
F[\Phi,v,S] = \int_\Omega \left(
\frac{\kappa_\Phi}{2}|\nabla\Phi|^2
+\frac{\kappa_v}{2}|\nabla\times v|^2
+\frac{\kappa_S}{2}|\nabla S|^2
-\lambda \,\Phi S \right)\,dx ,
\end{equation}
defined over a spatial domain $\Omega$.  

Each term plays a distinct role:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\frac{\kappa_\Phi}{2}|\nabla \Phi|^2$ penalizes rapid variation in scalar capacity, enforcing smooth distributions of potential.
    \item $\frac{\kappa_v}{2}|\nabla \times v|^2$ penalizes vorticity in vector flows, reflecting the tendency of negentropy currents to align and dissipate rotational turbulence.
    \item $\frac{\kappa_S}{2}|\nabla S|^2$ enforces continuity in entropy gradients, capturing the thermodynamic principle that disorder smooths over scales.
    \item The coupling term $-\lambda \Phi S$ expresses the reciprocal constraint between stored capacity and entropic cost.
\end{itemize}

Variational derivatives yield Euler-Lagrange equations that govern the dynamics:
\begin{align}
\frac{\delta F}{\delta \Phi} &= -\kappa_\Phi \Delta \Phi - \lambda S , \\
\frac{\delta F}{\delta v} &= -\kappa_v \nabla\times(\nabla\times v) , \\
\frac{\delta F}{\delta S} &= -\kappa_S \Delta S - \lambda \Phi .
\end{align}
These relations formalize how changes in one field feed back onto the others, producing coupled dissipative updates.

\subsection{Lamphron-Lamphrodyne Mechanism}
Beyond the action functional, RSVP introduces a novel smoothing principle called the \emph{lamphron-lamphrodyne mechanism}. This describes the way entropic gradients drive "falling outward" of space, dissipating irregularities while simultaneously preventing runaway accumulations of negentropy. It is conceptually similar to Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, where entropy production enables new forms of order \cite{Prigogine1980}, and to Haken's synergetics, where macroscopic order parameters stabilize collective dynamics \cite{Haken1983}. In RSVP, lamphron terms act as damping operators that ensure vector flows $v$ do not concentrate excessively and that entropy gradients $S$ relax instead of diverging.

\subsection{Entropy Budgets and Generalized Landauer Bounds}
The RSVP framework also generalizes the notion of entropy budgets. In classical information theory, Landauer's principle asserts that the erasure of $N$ bits requires a minimal entropy production of $(\ln 2)N$ \cite{Landauer1961,Bennett1982}. RSVP extends this bound to entire habitats or domains $\Omega$:
\begin{equation}
\Delta S(\Omega) \;\ge\; (\ln 2)\, N_{\mathrm{erased}},
\end{equation}
where $N_{\mathrm{erased}}$ refers to effective degrees of freedom lost through coarse-graining or structural reorganization. In this way, entropy is not merely a bookkeeping device but becomes a governing constraint on the viability of neural systems, ecosystems, and even cosmological configurations.

\subsection{Interpretive Summary}
In sum, RSVP posits that every physical and informational process can be represented as the interplay between scalar capacity, vector negentropy, and entropic dissipation. The action functional provides a unifying variational principle, the lamphron-lamphrodyne operator ensures smoothing and stability, and the generalized Landauer bound embeds computation and communication within the same thermodynamic substrate. Together, these principles lay the foundation for applying RSVP across cosmology, cognition, and semantic infrastructures.


\section{Cosmological Encodings}

A central claim of RSVP is that cosmological redshift can be reformulated as a cumulative measure of entropy gradients rather than as evidence of metric expansion. The fundamental relation is expressed as an entropic line integral along a photon trajectory $\gamma$:  
\begin{equation}
1+z(\gamma) = \exp\!\left(\frac{\alpha}{c}\int_\gamma \nabla S \cdot d\ell\right).
\end{equation}
Here, $\alpha$ is a coupling constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $S$ denotes the entropy field. The integral accumulates entropic contributions along the path, so that the observed redshift depends not on the stretching of space itself but on the smoothing and redistribution of entropy along worldlines.  

This formulation parallels thermodynamic derivations of the Einstein field equations, which interpret spacetime dynamics as emergent from entropy balance laws \cite{Jacobson:1995ab}. Where general relativity takes curvature as fundamental, RSVP interprets curvature as a secondary effect of entropic gradients interacting with scalar capacity and vector flows. The lamphron-lamphrodyne mechanism enforces smoothing of these gradients, producing a "falling outward" of space that mimics expansion without requiring a globally time-varying scale factor.  

Observable consequences follow from this reinterpretation. In the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the Hubble relation and acceleration are modeled through dark energy. RSVP instead predicts small but systematic deviations arising from the entropic integral:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO):} RSVP predicts slight phase shifts due to cumulative entropy smoothing, altering the precise scale imprinted in the galaxy distribution.
    \item \textbf{Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):} Low-$\ell$ anomalies can be understood as signatures of long-range entropy dependence, where early-universe entropy gradients left persistent imprints.
    \item \textbf{Gravitational Lensing:} Light deflection acquires an additional contribution from entropy gradients, leading to residuals relative to lensing predictions in $\Lambda$CDM.
\end{itemize}

A key mathematical innovation in this setting is the use of fractional entropy operators to capture long-range dependence:
\begin{equation}
D_t^\alpha S(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(1-\alpha)}\int_0^t \frac{\dot S(\tau)}{(t-\tau)^\alpha}\,d\tau, \quad 0<\alpha<1,
\end{equation}
which formalize the memory effects of entropy fields \cite{Barrow:2020unz}. These operators allow RSVP to incorporate persistent correlations across cosmological scales, aligning with the empirical fact that the universe retains structures and anomalies that are difficult to reconcile with purely local, memoryless dynamics.  

In summary, RSVP reinterprets cosmological redshift and structure formation as the outcome of entropic smoothing processes rather than global expansion. This perspective yields subtle but testable differences with $\Lambda$CDM, offering a framework in which horizon thermodynamics, large-scale correlations, and entropy gradients are the fundamental drivers of cosmological observables.

\section{Cognitive and Neural Dynamics}

RSVP extends classical neural-field models by embedding them in the tripartite field substrate. The baseline form is adapted from established formulations of population dynamics in cortical tissue \cite{Amari1977,Wilson:1972wza,Deco:2008zz}:
\begin{equation}
\partial_t u(x,t) = -u + (K\ast\sigma(u)) + a\Phi(x,t) + b\nabla\cdot v(x,t) - c\,\frac{\delta F}{\delta S}(x,t).
\end{equation}
Here $u(x,t)$ denotes the average activity at location $x$ and time $t$, $\sigma(u)$ is a nonlinear transfer function, and $K$ is a kernel mediating lateral interactions. The last three terms encode RSVP contributions: $\Phi$ couples scalar potential to neuronal excitation, $\nabla\cdot v$ introduces the influence of directed negentropic flow, and $\delta F/\delta S$ represents the entropic back-reaction on neural states.

\subsection{Predictive Coding in RSVP Fields}
Within the predictive coding framework \cite{Friston:2009ze,ParrPezzuloFriston2022}, cortical dynamics minimize variational free energy by continuously updating internal models to reduce prediction error. RSVP embeds this principle directly: $\Phi$ modulates the available representational capacity, $v$ corresponds to the propagation of prediction signals across layers or regions, and $S$ tracks the entropic cost of representational updates. Thus, predictive coding appears as a local manifestation of the more general RSVP variational structure, aligning neural error minimization with global entropy-smoothing dynamics.

\subsection{Stability and Regulation}
The inclusion of RSVP terms alters the stability conditions of neural fields. Classical Wilson-Cowan dynamics can exhibit oscillatory or unstable regimes depending on excitation-inhibition balance. In RSVP, the lamphron-lamphrodyne smoothing mechanism suppresses runaway amplification by coupling neural activity to entropy gradients, ensuring that local instabilities contribute to global reorganization rather than collapse. This introduces a thermodynamically grounded stabilizing principle into cortical modeling.

\subsection{Consciousness and RSVP Coherence}
Measures of consciousness such as integrated information ($\phi$) \cite{Oizumi2014,Tononi2012,Seth2016} can be reinterpreted in RSVP terms. Instead of treating $\phi$ as an abstract information-theoretic measure, RSVP frames it as a coherence functional over the tripartite fields:
\[
\phi_{\mathrm{RSVP}} \sim \int_\Omega \Big( \alpha_\Phi |\nabla \Phi|^2 + \alpha_v |\nabla \cdot v|^2 - \alpha_S \dot S \Big) dx,
\]
where positive contributions from $\Phi$ and $v$ reflect integrated capacity and directed flows, while $\dot S$ measures the entropic cost of maintaining coherence. This links phenomenological integration to concrete dynamical invariants, situating theories of consciousness within a field-theoretic, thermodynamic substrate.

\subsection{Interpretive Summary}
In summary, RSVP generalizes neural field theory by embedding predictive coding into a continuum of scalar, vector, and entropic fields. This allows cortical dynamics to be described as part of a larger entropic regulation process that spans from cosmological structure to semantic communication. Consciousness, in this view, is not an emergent anomaly but a natural invariant of RSVP coherence.

\section{Artificial Intelligence and Replicator Dynamics}

The RSVP framework extends classical replicator dynamics \cite{TaylorJonker1978,HofbauerSigmund1998,Nowak2006} by embedding utilities within the tripartite field substrate. In this setting, strategies or policies are represented by distributions $\pi(a|x)$ over actions $a$ in contexts $x$, and their evolution is governed by a modified replicator equation:
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \pi(a|x) = \pi(a|x)\Big( U_a[\Phi,v,S](x) - \sum_{a'} \pi(a'|x)\, U_{a'}[\Phi,v,S](x)\Big).
\end{equation}
Here $U_a[\Phi,v,S](x)$ denotes the effective utility of action $a$ as modulated by local scalar capacity $\Phi$, vector negentropic flux $v$, and entropy gradient $S$. The differential equation ensures that actions with above-average RSVP-weighted utility increase their prevalence, while less effective actions diminish.

\subsection{Entropy and Negentropic Forcing}
Unlike the classical replicator framework, which is driven by payoffs defined externally, RSVP internalizes the influence of entropy and negentropy. The divergence of $v$ represents the propagation of organized structure, while $\delta F/\delta S$ accounts for the entropic cost of maintaining policies. Thus, strategy adaptation is not only a matter of relative advantage but also of energetic feasibility. Policies that require excessive entropy production become unsustainable even if locally beneficial, aligning adaptation with global stability requirements.

\subsection{Gradient Flow Interpretation}
This RSVP-modified replicator can be viewed as a gradient flow on the simplex of strategies. The flow is shaped by the expected RSVP utility:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\pi} = \nabla_\pi \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[U(\Phi,v,S)] ,
\end{equation}
projected back onto the probability simplex. This provides a natural interpretation of learning as movement down an entropic potential landscape, where $\Phi$ sets representational capacity, $v$ encodes the dynamics of information propagation, and $S$ constrains policy search through cost functions.

\subsection{Connection to Autoregression}
RAT-style autoregression \cite{Hinton2006,LeCun2015} can be interpreted as a trajectory through RSVP space. At each timestep, the model samples an action conditioned on previous states, with $\pi(a|x)$ updating recursively. RSVP fields provide the substrate for this recursion: $\Phi$ establishes the available model complexity, $v$ transmits contextual influences forward in the sequence, and $S$ enforces smoothing constraints that prevent divergence. In this way, autoregressive learning becomes a concrete instantiation of RSVP replicator dynamics.

\subsection{Interpretive Summary}
In summary, RSVP generalizes replicator dynamics by embedding policy evolution in a thermodynamic substrate. Classical evolutionary game theory describes adaptation as payoff-driven selection, but RSVP reframes this as entropy-regulated gradient descent on the space of policies. This perspective not only accounts for the feasibility of strategies in energetic terms but also connects naturally to modern machine learning, where autoregression and policy optimization can be viewed as trajectories constrained by $\Phi$, $v$, and $S$.

\section{Semantic Infrastructure and Communication}

A central innovation of RSVP is that it treats communication and meaning not as discrete symbolic transfers but as field-theoretic processes governed by entropy budgets. The coupling of multiple RSVP-configured systems requires a mechanism for ensuring compatibility between their scalar, vector, and entropy fields. This is formalized in the \emph{Emerge functional}:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Emerge} = \int_\Omega \lambda_\Phi \|\Phi_1-\Phi_2\|^2 + \lambda_v \|v_1-v_2\|^2 + \lambda_S\, \mathrm{KL}(S_1 \Vert S_2)\, dx ,
\end{equation}
which quantifies the cost of aligning two semantic field configurations. The quadratic terms penalize mismatches in scalar capacity and vector flow, while the Kullback-Leibler divergence measures the entropic cost of reconciling distinct entropy distributions.  

\subsection{Homotopy-Colimit Semantics}
From a categorical perspective, the Emerge functional realizes homotopy-colimit semantics \cite{MacLane1998,BaezStay2010}, where local structures must be glued into a coherent global object. RSVP provides a quantitative measure of this gluing: the smaller the value of $\mathrm{Emerge}$, the more seamlessly the local semantic fields integrate. When $\mathrm{Emerge}$ exceeds a given threshold, communication breaks down, as the entropic cost of reconciliation becomes prohibitive.

\subsection{Extension of MDL and Free Energy}
This formulation extends the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle \cite{rissanen1978,Jaynes2003,Caticha2012} by embedding it in a field-theoretic substrate. In MDL, model selection favors hypotheses that compress data with minimal code length. RSVP generalizes this by favoring field configurations that minimize the combined quadratic and entropic divergence terms, effectively compressing not just symbol strings but distributions over semantic fields. Similarly, the free-energy principle \cite{Friston:2009ze} is naturally incorporated: minimizing $\mathrm{Emerge}$ corresponds to minimizing a variational free-energy-like functional that quantifies the discrepancy between internal and external field states.

\subsection{Interpretive Summary}
In this way, RSVP recasts communication as an entropic alignment process across distributed substrates. Semantic compatibility is not guaranteed by syntax alone but by the ability of systems to minimize the Emerge functional under shared constraints. This yields a unified perspective in which homotopy-colimit semantics, MDL, and the free-energy principle converge as special cases of entropy-respecting semantic infrastructure.

\section{Philosophy and Ethics of Entropy}

The RSVP framework extends beyond physics and cognition to provide a foundation for ethical reasoning. Its central normative construct is the entropy cost functional:
\begin{equation}
\Sigma[\Gamma] = \int_\Gamma \max(0,\dot S)\,dt ,
\end{equation}
which measures the cumulative forward entropy production along a worldline $\Gamma$. Only positive contributions of $\dot S$ are counted, reflecting the irreversible aspects of entropic growth. In this view, the ethical challenge of any process is quantified by the unavoidable entropy it generates.  

\subsection{Minimization of $\Sigma$ as a Normative Principle}
Minimizing $\Sigma$ corresponds to reducing the entropic burden of trajectories. In cognitive and social contexts, this can be interpreted as reducing unnecessary suffering: systems that generate disorder beyond what is required for stability impose costs on themselves and others. In technological contexts, minimizing $\Sigma$ expresses the demand for efficient computation and communication, aligning ethical imperatives with thermodynamic feasibility.  

\subsection{Constraint Navigation and Human Projects}
Ethics in RSVP is not about escaping entropy but navigating it. Ortega y Gasset's philosophy of life as a project \cite{Ortega1930} emphasizes that existence is defined by constraints that must be taken up and transformed into meaningful trajectories. RSVP grounds this view physically: projects correspond to worldlines $\Gamma$, and their ethical quality is measured by the entropy they incur. A project that navigates constraints with minimal $\Sigma$ exemplifies both efficiency and integrity.  

\subsection{Entropy as a Universal Ethical Substrate}
By situating ethics in entropy production, RSVP connects cosmological, cognitive, and social processes within a common metric. Just as the laws of thermodynamics govern physical systems, the measure $\Sigma$ provides a unifying criterion for evaluating action. This does not collapse normative reasoning into physics, but rather supplies a substrate on which values and goals must be inscribed. Entropy thus grounds ethics as the art of constraint navigation: finding ways of living, thinking, and organizing that minimize entropic waste while enabling the continuity of structured processes.

\subsection{Interpretive Summary}
In summary, RSVP reframes ethics as the minimization of forward entropy production. The functional $\Sigma$ serves as a measure of the normative cost of worldlines, linking suffering, efficiency, and constraint navigation. This alignment with Ortega's philosophy shows how thermodynamic invariants can underwrite ethical principles without reducing them to mechanistic rules.

\section{Engineering, Biology, and Infrastructure}

The RSVP framework extends naturally to engineering and biological systems, where entropy budgets determine the feasibility of sustaining organized processes. In neural systems, homeostasis can be modeled as a balance between scalar capacity $\Phi$ and entropy $S$: synaptic scaling ensures that excitatory and inhibitory drives remain within sustainable bounds, minimizing cumulative entropy production while preserving functional responsiveness. In this sense, RSVP generalizes classical cybernetic regulation \cite{Wiener1948,Ashby1956}, providing a thermodynamic foundation for stability in living systems.  

On larger scales, the same principles apply to infrastructures such as urban planning or computation. RSVP-inspired models like Yarncrawler and xylomorphic architecture capture how material flows, structural repair, and information exchange must be coordinated under entropic constraints. This echoes Levin's thesis that mind-like processes emerge wherever feedback and constraint navigation operate \cite{Levin2022}. Cities, like organisms, can thus be interpreted as RSVP systems: $\Phi$ corresponds to latent capacity (e.g. energy reserves, space, population), $v$ to directed flows (e.g. traffic, water, information), and $S$ to the entropy budget (e.g. waste heat, disorder, economic cost).  

Landauer's bound applies across these domains, extending from synaptic updates in cortical networks to municipal-scale computation. Every erasure or reorganization, whether of a bit in a processor or a resource allocation in a city, carries a minimal entropic cost. RSVP frames these costs not as incidental but as structural constraints that must be explicitly managed in both biological and technological systems.

\section{Safety and Governance}

Safety within RSVP is expressed mathematically through Lyapunov inequalities that certify stability in the presence of disturbances:
\begin{equation}
\dot V(x) \leq -c \|x\|^2 + d \|w\|^2 ,
\end{equation}
where $V(x)$ is a candidate Lyapunov function, $x$ the system state, and $w$ external perturbations. Negative drift in $V$ guarantees that trajectories remain bounded, formalizing safety as resilience against entropic shocks.  

Categorically, safety requires entropy-preserving morphisms between subsystems. Transformations that increase entropy beyond admissible thresholds destabilize the composite system, whereas entropy-respecting mappings preserve coherence. In this sense, safety is not only a property of dynamics but also of the categorical structure through which systems interconnect.  

Governance emerges in RSVP as the management of entropic budgets across multiple scales. At the institutional level, this translates into policies that allocate computational, energetic, and informational resources without exceeding entropy thresholds. This perspective echoes ongoing debates in AI safety and governance \cite{Bostrom2014,Russell2019,Urdshals2025}, but reframes alignment as the maintenance of constraint-respecting entropy flows. Rather than aligning agents to abstract values alone, RSVP demands that systems remain within the entropic limits that sustain coherence and viability.  

In summary, safety and governance in RSVP converge on a common principle: structured processes endure only when entropic costs are tracked and constrained. This provides a unified language for discussing biological resilience, engineered infrastructure, and the governance of intelligent systems.

\subsection*{Worked Example: Lyapunov-Certified Safety and an Entropy Budget Bound}

\paragraph{Toy RSVP module.}
Consider a linearized 2D RSVP slice around an operating point, with state
$x=\begin{bmatrix}\xi & \eta\end{bmatrix}^\top$ representing small deviations of
(\emph{i}) scalar capacity $\Phi$ and (\emph{ii}) the divergence of the vector flow $v$:
\begin{equation}
\dot x \;=\; A x + B w, 
\qquad
A=\begin{bmatrix}
-\alpha & \beta\\
-\gamma & -\delta
\end{bmatrix},\quad
B=\begin{bmatrix}
b_1\\ b_2
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta>0 .
\label{eq:toy-rsvp}
\end{equation}
Here $w(t)$ aggregates exogenous perturbations (e.g.\ demand shocks, sensory bursts, or load transients).

\paragraph{Lyapunov certificate.}
Let $P=P^\top\succ0$ solve the Lyapunov equation
\begin{equation}
A^\top P + P A \;=\; -Q,
\qquad Q=Q^\top\succ0 .
\end{equation}
Define $V(x)=x^\top P x$. Then along trajectories of \eqref{eq:toy-rsvp}:
\begin{align}
\dot V(x)
&= x^\top(A^\top P + P A)x + 2x^\top P B\,w \nonumber\\
&= -\,x^\top Q x + 2\,x^\top P B\,w \nonumber\\
&\le -\,\lambda_{\min}(Q)\,\|x\|^2 + 2\,\|P B\|\,\|x\|\,\|w\| \nonumber\\
&\le -\,\underbrace{\tfrac{\lambda_{\min}(Q)}{2}}_{=:c}\,\|x\|^2
\;+\;\underbrace{\frac{2\|P B\|^2}{\lambda_{\min}(Q)}}_{=:d}\,\|w\|^2 ,
\label{eq:Vdot-bound}
\end{align}
where the last step uses Young's inequality $2ab\le \epsilon a^2 + \epsilon^{-1} b^2$ with $\epsilon=\lambda_{\min}(Q)$.
This is exactly of the RSVP safety form $\dot V \le -c\|x\|^2 + d\|w\|^2$.

\paragraph{Input-to-state bound (finite horizon).}
Integrating \eqref{eq:Vdot-bound} on $[0,T]$ gives
\begin{equation}
V(x(T)) - V(x(0))
\;\le\; -\,c \int_0^T \|x(t)\|^2 dt \;+\; d \int_0^T \|w(t)\|^2 dt .
\end{equation}
Dropping $V(x(T))\ge 0$ and using $V(x)\ge \lambda_{\min}(P)\|x\|^2$ yields
\begin{equation}
\int_0^T \|x(t)\|^2 dt
\;\le\; \frac{V(x(0))}{c}
\;+\; \frac{d}{c}\int_0^T \|w(t)\|^2 dt
\;\le\; \frac{\lambda_{\max}(P)}{c}\,\|x(0)\|^2
\;+\; \frac{d}{c}\int_0^T \|w\|^2 .
\label{eq:L2state-bound}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Entropy production coupling and budget.}
Assume the local entropy production rate obeys a quadratic bound in the deviation state and a linear bound in disturbance power:
\begin{equation}
\max(0,\dot S)\;\le\; \rho\,\|x\|^2 \;+\; \kappa\,\|w\|^2,
\qquad \rho,\kappa \ge 0 .
\label{eq:Sdot-bound}
\end{equation}
Then the RSVP ethical/safety cost over $[0,T]$ satisfies
\begin{align}
\Sigma[0,T]
&= \int_0^T \max(0,\dot S)\,dt
\;\le\; \rho \int_0^T \|x\|^2 dt \;+\; \kappa \int_0^T \|w\|^2 dt \nonumber\\
&\le\; \rho\Big(\frac{\lambda_{\max}(P)}{c}\,\|x(0)\|^2
\;+\; \frac{d}{c}\int_0^T \|w\|^2 dt\Big)
\;+\; \kappa \int_0^T \|w\|^2 dt \nonumber\\
&=\; \underbrace{\frac{\rho\,\lambda_{\max}(P)}{c}}_{=:C_0}\,\|x(0)\|^2
\;+\; \underbrace{\Big(\frac{\rho d}{c}+\kappa\Big)}_{=:C_w}\,\int_0^T \|w\|^2 dt .
\label{eq:Sigma-budget}
\end{align}
Thus, the forward entropy budget is explicitly bounded by initial deviation energy and the cumulative disturbance energy.

\paragraph{Numerical illustration (one choice).}
Take $\alpha=\delta=1$, $\beta=\gamma=\tfrac{1}{2}$, $B=[1\;0]^\top$. Choosing $Q=I$ gives a unique $P\succ0$
from $A^\top P+PA=-I$. With this choice one computes $c=\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $d=2\|P B\|^2$.
For any $\rho,\kappa\ge0$, the bound \eqref{eq:Sigma-budget} becomes
\[
\Sigma[0,T]\;\le\;
\big(2\rho\,\lambda_{\max}(P)\big)\,\|x(0)\|^2 \;+\; \big(2\rho\,\|P B\|^2+\kappa\big)\,\!\int_0^T \! \|w\|^2 dt .
\]
\emph{Interpretation:} reducing $\|x(0)\|$ (good initialization), shrinking $\|P B\|$ (disturbance coupling), or increasing $c$ (more damping via controller design) all tighten the safety and entropy budgets.

\paragraph{Two-module interconnection (sketch).}
For two modules $x_1,x_2$ with the same form as \eqref{eq:toy-rsvp} and reciprocal couplings $w_1=C_{12}x_2$, $w_2=C_{21}x_1$, define $X=[x_1^\top\,x_2^\top]^\top$ and $V= x_1^\top P_1 x_1 + x_2^\top P_2 x_2$. If
$\|C_{12}\|\|P_1 B_1\|+\|C_{21}\|\|P_2 B_2\|$ is sufficiently small compared with $\min\{c_1,c_2\}$, then
\[
\dot V \;\le\; -\,\underline{c}\,\|X\|^2
\quad \text{for some }\underline{c}>0,
\]
so the interconnected pair remains Lyapunov-stable and inherits a bound of the form \eqref{eq:Sigma-budget} with modified constants. Operationally, this encodes \emph{categorical safety}: inter-module morphisms must preserve admissible entropy budgets.

\medskip
\noindent
\textbf{Takeaway.} The RSVP safety inequality $\dot V\le -c\|x\|^2+d\|w\|^2$ provides (i) stability certificates, (ii) input-state energy bounds \eqref{eq:L2state-bound}, and (iii) explicit \emph{entropy budget} guarantees \eqref{eq:Sigma-budget}. These translate directly into design rules: tune damping (increase $c$), reduce disturbance channels ($\|PB\|$), and set coupling gains to keep composite systems within global entropic limits.

\section{Integration with Derived Geometry and AKSZ}

The RSVP framework can be placed within the language of Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) quantization \cite{BatalinVilkovisky1981} and the Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky (AKSZ) construction \cite{Alexandrov:1995kv}. In this setting, RSVP observables are interpreted as BV functionals, and the consistency of the theory is ensured by the classical master equation:
\begin{equation}
(S_{\mathrm{BV}}, S_{\mathrm{BV}}) = 0 ,
\end{equation}
where $(\cdot,\cdot)$ denotes the BV antibracket. This condition enforces closure under gauge symmetries and guarantees that the entropy, scalar, and vector sectors of RSVP remain dynamically consistent when treated as interacting fields.

\subsection{RSVP as a Sigma Model}
The AKSZ framework provides a systematic method for constructing topological sigma models with target spaces carrying shifted symplectic structures. RSVP fits naturally into this architecture: the scalar capacity $\Phi$, vector negentropic flow $v$, and entropy field $S$ can be viewed as components of a map from a source supermanifold (e.g.\ $T[1]\Sigma$) into a target graded symplectic manifold encoding the plenum. The AKSZ action then takes the schematic form
\begin{equation}
S_{\mathrm{AKSZ}}[X] = \int_{T[1]\Sigma} \langle \eta, dX \rangle + \int_{T[1]\Sigma} \Theta(X) ,
\end{equation}
where $X$ encodes RSVP fields, $\eta$ are their antifields, and $\Theta$ specifies the homological vector field encoding entropic coupling. In this formulation, RSVP is not an ad hoc extension but a well-structured sigma model consistent with higher symplectic geometry.

\subsection{Shifted Symplectic Structures}
Derived geometry clarifies the role of entropy within RSVP. As shown by Pantev, Toën, Vaquié, and Vezzosi \cite{Pantev:2011ns}, shifted symplectic structures provide the natural language for handling fields with nontrivial degrees. RSVP can be interpreted as a $(-1)$-shifted symplectic system: $\Phi$, $v$, and $S$ are assigned graded degrees, and their coupling terms in the functional $F[\Phi,v,S]$ correspond to shifted symplectic pairings. This ensures that the entropy field $S$ is not merely an auxiliary variable but part of the canonical symplectic structure, with variational derivatives satisfying the required BV closure.

\subsection{Triplicate Encodings and Closure}
An important feature of RSVP is its use of triplicate encodings—mathematical, categorical, and obfuscated—which mirror the ghost/antifield structure in BV theory. Each observable has three complementary representations, and their consistency requires a closure condition akin to $(S_{\mathrm{BV}},S_{\mathrm{BV}})=0$. In practice, this means that physical (cosmological), cognitive (neural), and semantic (communicative) realizations of RSVP must be mutually consistent: entropy production in one domain must be representable as entropy flow in another. The triplicate encoding thus unifies physics, cognition, and semantics in the same way that BV/AKSZ unifies fields, ghosts, and antifields.

\subsection{Interpretive Summary}
In summary, RSVP is compatible with derived geometry and AKSZ sigma models. Its observables fit into the BV formalism, its dynamics admit a sigma-model action, and its triplicate encodings parallel ghost-antifield closures. This embedding demonstrates that RSVP is not only a phenomenological framework but also mathematically consistent with modern approaches to higher geometry and field theory.

\subsection*{Worked Mapping: RSVP as a $(-1)$-Shifted Symplectic AKSZ/BV Model}

\paragraph{Target data (graded manifold).}
Let the target be a graded manifold $\mathcal M$ with degree assignments
\[
|\Phi|=|v|=|S|=0,\qquad
|\Phi^\ast|=|v^\ast|=|S^\ast|=-1,
\]
where $(\Phi,v,S)$ are RSVP fields and $(\Phi^\ast,v^\ast,S^\ast)$ their BV antifields. Equip $\mathcal M$ with a $(-1)$-shifted symplectic form
\begin{equation}
\omega_{-1}
=\int_\Omega \big(\delta \Phi^\ast \wedge \delta \Phi
\;+\; \delta v^\ast \!\cdot\! \delta v
\;+\; \delta S^\ast \wedge \delta S\big),
\qquad |\omega_{-1}|=-1.
\end{equation}
This yields the BV antibracket $\{\!\{\,\cdot,\cdot\,\}\!\}$ on functionals $F,G$:
\begin{equation}
\{\!\{F,G\}\!\}
=\int_\Omega\!\left(
\frac{\overrightarrow{\delta} F}{\delta \Phi}\frac{\overleftarrow{\delta} G}{\delta \Phi^\ast}
-\frac{\overrightarrow{\delta} F}{\delta \Phi^\ast}\frac{\overleftarrow{\delta} G}{\delta \Phi}
+\frac{\overrightarrow{\delta} F}{\delta v}\!\cdot\!\frac{\overleftarrow{\delta} G}{\delta v^\ast}
-\frac{\overrightarrow{\delta} F}{\delta v^\ast}\!\cdot\!\frac{\overleftarrow{\delta} G}{\delta v}
+\frac{\overrightarrow{\delta} F}{\delta S}\frac{\overleftarrow{\delta} G}{\delta S^\ast}
-\frac{\overrightarrow{\delta} F}{\delta S^\ast}\frac{\overleftarrow{\delta} G}{\delta S}
\right).
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Source and superfields.}
Let the source be the shifted tangent bundle $T[1]\Sigma$ of a spacetime slice $\Sigma$ with local coordinates $(\sigma^i,\theta^i)$, where $|\theta^i|=1$. Promote fields to superfields, e.g.
\[
\widehat{\Phi}(\sigma,\theta)=\Phi(\sigma)+\theta^i \Phi_i(\sigma)+\cdots,
\]
and similarly for $v,S$ and antifields. The de Rham differential on $T[1]\Sigma$ acts as $d_\Sigma=\theta^i\partial_i$ of degree $+1$.

\paragraph{AKSZ/BV action (toy construction).}
Consider the kinetic AKSZ term plus an interaction specified by a Hamiltonian density $H(\Phi,v,S)$ of degree $0$:
\begin{equation}
S_{\mathrm{BV}} \;=\; \int_{T[1]\Sigma}\!\Big(
\Phi^\ast d_\Sigma \Phi
+ v^\ast \!\cdot d_\Sigma v
+ S^\ast d_\Sigma S\Big)
\;+\; \int_{T[1]\Sigma}\!\Theta(\Phi,v,S,\Phi^\ast,v^\ast,S^\ast),
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\Theta \;=\; \Phi^\ast A_\Phi(\Phi,v,S)
\;+\; v^\ast \!\cdot A_v(\Phi,v,S)
\;+\; S^\ast A_S(\Phi,v,S)
\;+\; H(\Phi,v,S).
\end{equation}
Here $A=(A_\Phi,A_v,A_S)$ is a degree $+1$ homological vector field on $\mathcal M$ (the ``$Q$-structure''). A concrete RSVP-inspired choice that mirrors gradient flows generated by the RSVP functional $F[\Phi,v,S]$ is
\begin{equation}
A_\Phi = -\gamma_\Phi\,\frac{\delta F}{\delta \Phi},\qquad
A_v     = -\gamma_v\,\frac{\delta F}{\delta v},\qquad
A_S     = -\gamma_S\,\frac{\delta F}{\delta S},
\qquad H \equiv 0,
\label{eq:Q-grad}
\end{equation}
with positive constants $\gamma_{\Phi,v,S}$. Degree counting: $|\Phi^\ast|=-1$, $|A_\Phi|=+1$, so each term $\Phi^\ast A_\Phi$ has degree $0$, as required for an action.

\paragraph{Master equation check.}
The classical master equation reads
\[
\{\!\{S_{\mathrm{BV}},S_{\mathrm{BV}}\}\!\}=0 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\{\!\{\Theta,\Theta\}\!\} + 2\,\{\!\{\Theta, \text{kinetic}\}\!\}=0.
\]
In the AKSZ setup, the kinetic term implements $d_\Sigma$, so the master equation reduces to
\[
Q^2=0 \quad\text{and}\quad \mathcal L_Q \omega_{-1}=0,
\]
where $Q$ is the homological vector field generated by $\Theta$ via $Q(\cdot)=\{\!\{\Theta,\cdot\}\!\}$. For the choice \eqref{eq:Q-grad}, $Q$ is the (formal) gradient vector field of $F$; nilpotency $Q^2=0$ follows if the gradient components satisfy $\partial_jA_i-\partial_iA_j=0$ (integrability) on field space, which holds for (strict) gradient flows. Preservation of $\omega_{-1}$ is automatic for Hamiltonian $Q$.

\paragraph{Observables and degrees.}
Local RSVP observables $\mathcal O[\Phi,v,S]$ are degree-$0$ functionals annihilated by $Q$ on-shell:
\[
Q\,\mathcal O = \{\!\{\Theta,\mathcal O\}\!\}=0 \quad \text{(on equations of motion)}.
\]
Triplicate encodings (mathematical/categorical/obfuscated) correspond, in BV language, to representatives of the same cohomology class that differ by $Q$-exact terms.

\paragraph{Summary.}
With degrees $|\Phi|=|v|=|S|=0$ and antifields in degree $-1$, the canonical $\omega_{-1}$ produces the BV bracket; an AKSZ action with kinetic $d_\Sigma$ and Hamiltonian $\Theta$ built from the RSVP functional $F$ yields a homological vector field $Q$ whose nilpotency and symplecticity ensure the master equation. This realizes RSVP as a concrete $(-1)$-shifted symplectic sigma model and explains why its triplicate encodings admit BV-closed observables.


\section{Conclusion and Outlook}

RSVP offers a unifying framework for cosmology, cognition, computation, and ethics by treating scalar capacity, vector negentropy, and entropy as the fundamental fields through which dynamics unfold. Across scales, this tripartite substrate encodes redshift, cortical activity, semantic communication, and normative constraints within a single continuum description.  

Future directions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Empirical tests of RSVP redshift integrals against predictions of $\Lambda$CDM, with particular attention to BAO shifts, CMB anomalies, and lensing residuals.
    \item RSVP-based consciousness experiments that reframe integrated information and predictive coding in terms of coherence across $\Phi$, $v$, and $S$.
    \item The design of semantic infrastructures as entropy-respecting computation, extending MDL and free-energy principles into distributed field systems.
    \item The development of safety protocols grounded in Lyapunov inequalities and categorical morphisms that preserve entropy budgets across coupled subsystems.
\end{itemize}

Historically, the intellectual lineage of RSVP draws on complexity and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures \cite{Prigogine1980} demonstrated how entropy production can paradoxically give rise to order, while Haken's synergetics \cite{Haken1983} developed the mathematics of self-organization in nonlinear systems. These insights, together with advances in synergetic neural modeling, provide strong evidence that entropy, far from being a force of decay alone, is the generative principle by which structure emerges across scales. Complexity science more broadly has shown that such principles recur across domains ranging from physics to biology to social systems \cite{Smolin2019,Levin2022}.  

From a philosophical standpoint, RSVP resonates with Ortega y Gasset's notion of life as a project under constraint \cite{Ortega1930}, Jaynes's program of entropic inference \cite{Jaynes2003}, and Dennett's multiple-drafts model of consciousness \cite{Dennett1991}. It suggests that ethics, cognition, and cosmology can all be reformulated as problems of navigating entropic budgets within structured fields.  

Thus, the central claim of RSVP is that what appear as disparate theories---entropic gravity, predictive brains, and cybernetic feedback loops---are in fact different projections of a single tripartite field system. RSVP therefore stands as a candidate for an AKSZ-style unification of physical and semantic dynamics, motivating systematic development as both a mathematical framework and an empirical research program.

\section{PDEs and Boundary Conditions for RSVP Fields}
The RSVP framework introduces three coupled fields: scalar capacity $\Phi$, vector flow $v$, and entropy $S$. Their joint evolution can be expressed via gradient-flow equations derived from the RSVP action functional:
\begin{align}
\partial_t \Phi &= -\gamma_\Phi \frac{\delta F}{\delta \Phi} + f_\Phi, \\
\partial_t v    &= -\gamma_v \frac{\delta F}{\delta v} + f_v, \\
\partial_t S    &= -\gamma_S \frac{\delta F}{\delta S} + f_S,
\end{align}
where $F[\Phi,v,S]$ is the free-energy-like functional defined in the main text.  
Boundary conditions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Periodic:} $(\Phi,v,S)(x+L)=(\Phi,v,S)(x)$, appropriate for cosmological tilings.
    \item \textbf{Reflective:} $n\cdot v=0$ at $\partial \Omega$, for cognitive domains bounded by cortical geometry.
    \item \textbf{Absorbing:} $S\to S_0$ at infinity, used in entropy-dissipative cosmological models.
\end{itemize}
Well-posedness can be studied using methods from synergetics \cite{Haken1983} and dissipative systems \cite{Prigogine1980}.

\section{BV/AKSZ Technical Details}
The Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism \cite{BatalinVilkovisky1981} provides a natural setting for RSVP. The master equation
\[
(S_{\mathrm{BV}},S_{\mathrm{BV}})=0
\]
encodes consistency of the field algebra, while the Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky (AKSZ) construction \cite{Alexandrov:1995kv} generalizes RSVP as a sigma model. Shifted symplectic geometry \cite{Pantev:2011ns} provides the appropriate derived manifold structure. Path-integral realizations \cite{Cattaneo:1999fm} suggest RSVP can be quantized by AKSZ techniques, with $(\Phi,v,S)$ mapped as fields from $T[1]\Sigma$ into a symplectic dg-manifold $M$.

\section{Fractional Operators and Long-Range Dependence}
Entropy fields $S$ exhibit long-range dependence (LRD). A fractional derivative formulation is natural:
\[
D_t^\alpha S(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(1-\alpha)}\int_0^t \frac{\dot S(\tau)}{(t-\tau)^\alpha}\,d\tau, \quad 0<\alpha<1.
\]
This captures persistent memory in cosmological entropy smoothing, consistent with anomalous correlations reported in horizon thermodynamics \cite{Barrow:2020unz}. Spectral methods show $C(\tau)\sim \tau^{-\beta}$, bridging RSVP dynamics with cosmological observations.

\section{RAT Formalism and Autoregressive Cognition}
The Recursive Autoregressive Trajectory (RAT) framework extends RSVP to cognition. State updates follow
\[
x_{t+1} = f(x_t,\Phi_t,v_t,S_t) + \epsilon_t,
\]
with $\epsilon_t$ fractional noise encoding long-range priors. This resonates with predictive processing \cite{Hohwy2013,Friston:2009ze} and autoregressive cognition models \cite{Hinton2006,LeCun2015}. Convergence properties connect to evolutionary replicator dynamics \cite{TaylorJonker1978,HofbauerSigmund1998}.

\section{HYDRA Engineering Specification}
HYDRA architecture treats RSVP as a multi-head system, each head a distinct $(\Phi_i,v_i,S_i)$ module. Persona vectors define boundary data for $\Phi$, shaping functional specialization. Safety is guaranteed by Lyapunov functionals \cite{Ashby1956,Wiener1948}. The architecture addresses AI alignment concerns \cite{Bostrom2014,Russell2019} by embedding entropic budget constraints into modular decision systems.

\section{TARTAN Mathematical Framework}
TARTAN (Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise) applies recursive tiling functors to RSVP fields. Each tile carries Gaussian aura fields with metadata. This allows RSVP simulations to maintain coherence across scales. Compositional closure ensures stability of emergent semantic trajectories, echoing synergetic tiling approaches \cite{Haken1983}.

\section{Semantic Merge Operator}
Semantic infrastructure requires entropy-respecting composition. For modules $\{M_i\}$:
\[
\mathrm{Merge}(\{M_i\}) = \operatorname*{hocolim}_{i\in I} M_i.
\]
Obstructions manifest as sheaf cohomology classes \cite{MacLane1998,BaezStay2010}. The RSVP Emerge functional provides a quantitative constraint:
\[
\mathrm{Emerge}=\int_\Omega \lambda_\Phi\|\Phi_1-\Phi_2\|^2+\lambda_v\|v_1-v_2\|^2+\lambda_S\,\mathrm{KL}(S_1\Vert S_2)\,dx.
\]
This extends Rissanen's MDL principle \cite{rissanen1978} and Shannon information \cite{Shannon1948,CoverThomas2006} to semantic gluing.

\section{EAIMR and Praxicon Formalization}
The Effective Assembly Index for Mind Recognition (EAIMR) measures improbability of coherent assembly \cite{Levin2022}:
\[
\mathrm{EAIMR}(X)=-\log P_{\text{null}}(X).
\]
The praxicon, a sheaf of motor/semantic actions in the temporoparietal junction, can be understood as RSVP-structured \cite{Deco:2008zz,Oizumi2014,Seth2016}. Failures of $v$-field divergence link to anosognosia in dementia contexts.

\section{Empirical Protocols}
Three empirical pathways illustrate RSVP:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cosmology:} Fitting entropy-redshift integrals \cite{Jacobson:1995ab,Verlinde:2010hp,Padmanabhan:2009vy,Carney2022} against supernovae and BAO datasets.
    \item \textbf{Cognition:} RSVP-forced neural PDEs tested with fMRI/EEG \cite{Amari1977,Wilson:1972wza,Deco:2008zz}.
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure:} RSVP MERGE used for adaptive routing in municipal garbage collection or resource distribution \cite{Wiener1948,Ashby1956}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reproducibility and Pipelines}
All RSVP simulations must be offline-first and reproducible. Pipelines integrate Bash, Python, and LaTeX with containerization. Deterministic builds align with Landauer's thermodynamic cost of computation \cite{Landauer1961,Bennett1982}. Versioning adopts semantic modules rather than files, consistent with category-theoretic infrastructures.

Thought for 33s
The manuscript presents the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) as a theoretical framework that integrates concepts from cosmology, cognitive science, computational theory, and semantic systems through a tripartite field structure consisting of a scalar capacity field
Φ
\Phi
Φ
, a vector negentropic flow field
v
v
v
, and an entropy field
S
S
S
. This approach posits that diverse phenomena, such as gravitational redshift, neural dynamics, replicator evolution, and ethical governance, emerge from the interplay of these fields under entropic constraints.
The introduction contextualizes RSVP within established theories, including entropic gravity derivations, predictive processing in neuroscience, and cybernetic regulation. It draws on historical contributions from thermodynamics and complexity science to argue for a unified substrate where entropy serves as both a dissipative and generative force.
The core formalism defines RSVP fields and derives their dynamics via a free-energy functional
F
[
Φ
,
v
,
S
]
F[\Phi, v, S]
F
[
Φ
,
v
,
S
]
, leading to Euler-Lagrange equations that describe coupled dissipative processes. Additional mechanisms, such as the lamphron-lamphrodyne smoothing and generalized Landauer bounds, ensure stability and thermodynamic consistency.
Applications span multiple domains:
In cosmology, redshift is reframed as an entropic path integral, predicting deviations from
Λ
\Lambda
Λ
CDM in observables like baryon acoustic oscillations and cosmic microwave background anomalies.
In neural dynamics, RSVP extends classical field models to incorporate predictive coding and consciousness measures, interpreting integrated information as field coherence.
In artificial intelligence, replicator dynamics are modulated by RSVP fields, linking policy evolution to entropic gradient flows and autoregressive learning.
In semantic systems, communication is modeled via an Emerge functional that quantifies alignment costs, extending minimum description length and free-energy principles.
Ethical and governance implications emphasize minimizing forward entropy production, aligning with philosophical views on constraint navigation.
Engineering extensions apply RSVP to biological homeostasis and infrastructure design, while safety is formalized through Lyapunov inequalities and entropy-preserving morphisms. The framework integrates with Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization and AKSZ sigma models, ensuring mathematical closure.
Appendices provide technical details on partial differential equations, fractional operators, and empirical protocols, alongside glossaries for novel terms.
The compilation log indicates unresolved citations due to an incomplete BibTeX process, resulting in undefined references in the output PDF. Re-running the Makefile as specified would resolve this by generating the .bbl file and incorporating the provided .bib entries. The document's mathematical derivations appear consistent within the proposed formalism, though empirical validation would require targeted testing against cosmological and neuroscientific datasets.
Why doesn't the makefile run the bibtex after running pdflatex? # Makefile for RSVP manuscript

The Makefile you provided is designed to compile the LaTeX document
unified-encodings.tex
into a PDF, incorporating bibliography processing with BibTeX. The sequence of commands in the Makefile is correct and should run
bibtex
after the initial
pdflatex
run, as specified in the rule for
$(TEXFILE).pdf
:
makefile
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
$(
TEXFILE
)
.pdf:
$(
TEXFILE
)
.tex
$(
BIBFILE
)
.bib appendices.tex
pdflatex
$(
TEXFILE
)
.tex
bibtex
$(
TEXFILE
)
pdflatex
$(
TEXFILE
)
.tex
pdflatex
$(
TEXFILE
)
.tex
This rule indicates that:
The first
pdflatex $(TEXFILE).tex
generates an
.aux
file containing citation and reference information.
The
bibtex $(TEXFILE)
command processes the
.aux
file and the
references.bib
file to produce a
.bbl
file with formatted bibliography entries.
The subsequent
pdflatex
runs (two additional times) incorporate the
.bbl
file and resolve cross-references, producing the final PDF.
Given this structure, the Makefile
does
run
bibtex
after the initial
pdflatex
command, as intended. However, the log you provided indicates unresolved citations and a missing
.bbl
file, suggesting that the BibTeX step may not have executed successfully or that there was an issue preventing proper bibliography integration. Below, I analyze potential reasons why the BibTeX step might appear not to have run or failed to resolve citations, and provide steps to diagnose and fix the issue.
Potential Reasons for BibTeX Issues
BibTeX Execution Failure
:
If the
bibtex
command fails (e.g., due to errors in the
.bib
file or missing dependencies), it might not generate the
.bbl
file, leading to undefined references in the PDF.
The log shows "No file unified-encodings.bbl," which suggests that
bibtex
either did not run successfully or was skipped due to an error in the previous
pdflatex
step.
Error in the LaTeX File Halting the Process
:
The log includes errors related to the
appendices.tex
file, specifically LaTeX preamble commands (e.g.,
\documentclass
,
\usepackage
) being used outside the preamble. These errors occur because
appendices.tex
is structured as a standalone document with its own preamble, which is incompatible with being included via
\input{appendices.tex}
in the main document.
If the first
pdflatex
run fails due to these errors, the Makefile may halt before reaching the
bibtex
step, or the
.aux
file may be incomplete or corrupted, causing
bibtex
to fail silently.
Missing or Incorrect
.bib
File
:
If the
references.bib
file is missing, not in the correct directory, or contains syntax errors,
bibtex
will fail to produce a
.bbl
file, resulting in undefined citations.
The provided
.bib
entries appear syntactically correct, but if the file is not named exactly
references.bib
or is not in the working directory,
bibtex
will not find it.
Incomplete Makefile Execution
:
If the Makefile is interrupted (e.g., due to user cancellation, permissions issues, or system errors), the
bibtex
step might not execute, even though it is specified in the rule.
The log suggests that the first
pdflatex
run completed (producing 19 pages), but the absence of the
.bbl
file indicates that
bibtex
may not have run or failed.
Caching or File Dependency Issues
:
If the
.aux
file from a previous run is outdated or corrupted,
bibtex
might not process citations correctly. The Makefile's dependency on
$(TEXFILE).tex
,
$(BIBFILE).bib
, and
appendices.tex
should trigger a rebuild if these files change, but manual modifications or caching issues could interfere.
The log's warning about
Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right
indicates that additional runs are needed, which aligns with the Makefile's multiple
pdflatex
calls, but errors may prevent completion.
LaTeX Environment Issues
:
If the LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live 2022) lacks necessary BibTeX tools or if the environment is misconfigured, the
bibtex
command might fail.
The log confirms that
pdfTeX
and related tools are available, so this is less likely, but path issues or missing BibTeX styles (e.g.,
unsrt
) could still cause problems.
Steps to Diagnose and Fix the Issue
To determine why
bibtex
is not running or not resolving citations correctly, follow these steps:
Fix the
appendices.tex
Error
:
The primary issue in the log is the LaTeX error in
appendices.tex
, where preamble commands like
\documentclass
and
\usepackage
are used within an included file. LaTeX requires all preamble commands to appear before
\begin{document}
in the main document.
Solution
: Modify
appendices.tex
to remove the standalone document structure. Since
appendices.tex
is included via
\input{appendices.tex}
, it should contain only the content to be included, not a full document. Create a new version of
appendices.tex
as follows:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
% appendices.tex
\appendix
\section
{PDEs and Boundary Conditions for RSVP Fields}
% ... (keep the content as is, without \documentclass, \usepackage, \begin{document}, etc.)
% ... (all sections up to Glossary of Neologisms)
\bibliographystyle
{unsrt}
\bibliography
{references}
Remove the following lines from
appendices.tex
:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
\documentclass
[
12pt
]{
article
}
\usepackage
{
amsmath,amssymb,amsthm
}
\usepackage
{
geometry
}
\usepackage
{
hyperref
}
\geometry
{margin=1in}
\title
{Appendices: Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum}
\author
{Flyxion}
\date
{}
\begin
{
document
}
\maketitle
\end
{
document
}
Then, ensure the main document (
unified-encodings.tex
) includes the bibliography commands only once, either in the main file or in
appendices.tex
. Since the current
unified-encodings.tex
already has
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
and
\bibliography{references}
at the end, remove these from
appendices.tex
to avoid duplication.
Verify the
references.bib
File
:
Ensure that
references.bib
exists in the same directory as the Makefile and
unified-encodings.tex
.
Check for syntax errors in
references.bib
. The provided entries look correct, but confirm that the file is saved as
references.bib
and matches the name specified in
BIBFILE=references
.
Run
bibtex unified-encodings
manually from the command line after the first
pdflatex
run and check the output for errors (e.g., in the
.blg
file). For example:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
bibtex
unified-encodings
If
bibtex
reports errors (e.g., missing fields in
.bib
entries or inability to find
references.bib
), address them accordingly.
Run the Makefile Verbose
:
Execute the Makefile with verbose output to confirm that all steps are running:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
make
-d
This will show whether
bibtex
is being called and if it encounters errors. Look for messages indicating whether
bibtex unified-encodings
executed and check the
unified-encodings.blg
file for BibTeX errors.
Check for Interruptions
:
Ensure that the Makefile runs to completion without interruptions. If you interrupted the process (e.g., with Ctrl+C), the
bibtex
step might not have executed. Run
make clean
to remove intermediate files, then run
make
again:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
make
clean
make
Manually Run the Compilation Sequence
:
To isolate the issue, run the commands in the Makefile manually:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
bibtex
unified-encodings
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
After each step, check the output files (e.g.,
unified-encodings.aux
,
unified-encodings.bbl
,
unified-encodings.blg
) for errors. The
.blg
file will contain BibTeX's log, which may indicate issues like missing
.bib
entries or style file problems.
Ensure BibTeX Style Availability
:
The document uses
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
, which is a standard BibTeX style. Verify that the
unsrt.bst
file is available in your TeX distribution (it should be in
/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/bibtex/bst/base/unsrt.bst
for TeX Live 2022). If missing, reinstall the BibTeX package or copy the
unsrt.bst
file to the working directory.
Check for LaTeX Errors Halting the Process
:
The log shows errors in
appendices.tex
that likely halt the
pdflatex
run, preventing a proper
.aux
file from being generated. After fixing
appendices.tex
as described above, re-run
pdflatex
and check the
.log
file for additional errors that might prevent
bibtex
from processing correctly.
Test with a Minimal Example
:
If the issue persists, create a minimal test to isolate the BibTeX problem. For example, create a test LaTeX file:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
% test.tex
\documentclass
[
12pt
]{
article
}
\usepackage
{
amsmath
}
\begin
{
document
}
This is a test citing
\cite
{Jacobson:1995ab}.
\bibliographystyle
{unsrt}
\bibliography
{references}
\end
{
document
}
Then, run:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
pdflatex
test.tex
bibtex
test
pdflatex
test.tex
pdflatex
test.tex
If this works, the issue is likely specific to
unified-encodings.tex
or
appendices.tex
. If it fails, there may be a broader issue with the BibTeX setup or
.bib
file.
Recommended Fix
The most immediate issue is the structure of
appendices.tex
, which causes LaTeX errors that likely interrupt the compilation process before
bibtex
can run successfully. Here's a step-by-step fix:
Modify
appendices.tex
:
Replace the content of
appendices.tex
with a version that omits the preamble and document structure, keeping only the appendix content:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
% appendices.tex
\appendix

{PDEs and Boundary Conditions for RSVP Fields}
The RSVP framework introduces three coupled fields: scalar capacity
$
\Phi
$
, vector flow
$
v
$
, and entropy
$
S
$
. Their joint evolution can be expressed via gradient-flow equations derived from the RSVP action functional:
\begin
{
align
}
\partial
_t
\Phi
&
= -
\gamma
_
\Phi
\frac{
\delta
F}{
\delta
\Phi
} + f_
\Phi
,
\\
\partial
_t v
&
= -
\gamma
_v \frac{
\delta
F}{
\delta
v} + f_v,
\\
\partial
_t S
&
= -
\gamma
_S \frac{
\delta
F}{
\delta
S} + f_S,
\end
{
align
}
where
$
F[
\Phi
,v,S]
$
is the free-energy-like functional defined in the main text.
Boundary conditions include:
\begin
{
itemize
}
\item
\textbf
{
Periodic:
}
$
(
\Phi
,v,S)(x+L)=(
\Phi
,v,S)(x)
$
, appropriate for cosmological tilings.
\item
\textbf
{
Reflective:

$

$
at
$

$
, for cognitive domains bounded by cortical geometry.
\item
\textbf
{
Absorbing:
}
$
S\to S_

$
at infinity, used in entropy-dissipative cosmological models.
\end
{
itemize
}
Well-posedness can be studied using methods from synergetics
\cite
{Haken1983} and dissipative systems
\cite
{Prigogine1980}.
\section
{BV/AKSZ Technical Details}
The Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism
\cite
{BatalinVilkovisky1981} provides a natural setting for RSVP. The master equation
\[
(S_{\mathrm{BV}},S_{\mathrm{BV}})=
0
\]
encodes consistency of the field algebra, while the Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky (AKSZ) construction
\cite
{Alexandrov:1995kv} generalizes RSVP as a sigma model. Shifted symplectic geometry
\cite
{Pantev:2011ns} provides the appropriate derived manifold structure. Path-integral realizations
\cite
{Cattaneo:1999fm} suggest RSVP can be quantized by AKSZ techniques, with
$
(
\Phi
,v,S)
$
mapped as fields from
$
T[
1
]
\Sigma
$
into a symplectic dg-manifold
$
M
$
.
\section
{Fractional Operators and Long-Range Dependence}
Entropy fields
$
S
$
exhibit long-range dependence (LRD). A fractional derivative formulation is natural:
\[
D_t^
\alpha
S(t) = \frac{
1
}{
\Gamma
(
1
-
\alpha
)}
\int
_
0
^t \frac{\dot S(
\tau
)}{(t-
\tau
)^
\alpha
}
\,
d
\tau
, \quad
0
<
\alpha
<
1
.
\]
This captures persistent memory in cosmological entropy smoothing, consistent with anomalous correlations reported in horizon thermodynamics
\cite
{Barrow:2020unz}. Spectral methods show
$
C(
\tau
)
\sim
\tau
^{-
\beta
}
$
, bridging RSVP dynamics with cosmological observations.
\section
{RAT Formalism and Autoregressive Cognition}
The Recursive Autoregressive Trajectory (RAT) framework extends RSVP to cognition. State updates follow
\[
x_{t+
1
} = f(x_t,
\Phi
_t,v_t,S_t) +
\epsilon
_t,
\]
with
$
\epsilon
_t
$
fractional noise encoding long-range priors. This resonates with predictive processing
\cite
{Hohwy2013,Friston:2009ze} and autoregressive cognition models
\cite
{Hinton2006,LeCun2015}. Convergence properties connect to evolutionary replicator dynamics
\cite
{TaylorJonker1978,HofbauerSigmund1998}.
\section
{HYDRA Engineering Specification}
HYDRA architecture treats RSVP as a multi-head system, each head a distinct
$
(
\Phi
_i,v_i,S_i)
$
module. Persona vectors define boundary data for
$
\Phi
$
, shaping functional specialization. Safety is guaranteed by Lyapunov functionals
\cite
{Ashby1956,Wiener1948}. The architecture addresses AI alignment concerns
\cite
{Bostrom2014,Russell2019} by embedding entropic budget constraints into modular decision systems.
\section
{TARTAN Mathematical Framework}
TARTAN (Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise) applies recursive tiling functors to RSVP fields. Each tile carries Gaussian aura fields with metadata. This allows RSVP simulations to maintain coherence across scales. Compositional closure ensures stability of emergent semantic trajectories, echoing synergetic tiling approaches
\cite
{Haken1983}.
\section
{Semantic Merge Operator}
Semantic infrastructure requires entropy-respecting composition. For modules
$
\{M_i\}
$
:
\[
\mathrm{Merge}(\{M_i\}) = \operatorname*{hocolim}_{i
\in
I} M_i.
\]
Obstructions manifest as sheaf cohomology classes
\cite
{MacLane1998,BaezStay2010}. The RSVP Emerge functional provides a quantitative constraint:
\[
\mathrm{Emerge}=
\int
_
\Omega
\lambda
_
\Phi
\|
\Phi
_
1
-
\Phi
_
2
\|
^
2
+
\lambda
_v
\|
v_
1
-v_
2
\|
^
2
+
\lambda
_S
\,
\mathrm{KL}(S_
1
\Vert S_
2
)
\,
dx.
\]
This extends Rissanen's MDL principle
\cite
{rissanen1978} and Shannon information
\cite
{Shannon1948,CoverThomas2006} to semantic gluing.
\section
{EAIMR and Praxicon Formalization}
The Effective Assembly Index for Mind Recognition (EAIMR) measures improbability of coherent assembly
\cite
{Levin2022}:
\[
\mathrm{EAIMR}(X)=-\log P_{\text{null}}(X).
\]
The praxicon, a sheaf of motor/semantic actions in the temporoparietal junction, can be understood as RSVP-structured
\cite
{Deco:2008zz,Oizumi2014,Seth2016}. Failures of
$
v
$
-field divergence link to anosognosia in dementia contexts.
\section
{Empirical Protocols}
Three empirical pathways illustrate RSVP:
\begin
{
enumerate
}
\item
\textbf
{
Cosmology:
} Fitting entropy-redshift integrals
\cite
{Jacobson:1995ab,Verlinde:2010hp,Padmanabhan:2009vy,Carney2022} against supernovae and BAO datasets.
\item
\textbf
{
Cognition:
} RSVP-forced neural PDEs tested with fMRI/EEG
\cite
{Amari1977,Wilson:1972wza,Deco:2008zz}.
\item
\textbf
{
Infrastructure:
} RSVP MERGE used for adaptive routing in municipal garbage collection or resource distribution
\cite
{Wiener1948,Ashby1956}.
\end
{
enumerate
}
\section
{Reproducibility and Pipelines}
All RSVP simulations must be offline-first and reproducible. Pipelines integrate Bash, Python, and LaTeX with containerization. Deterministic builds align with Landauer's thermodynamic cost of computation
\cite
{Landauer1961,Bennett1982}. Versioning adopts semantic modules rather than files, consistent with category-theoretic infrastructures.

Update the Main Document
:
Ensure that
unified-encodings.tex
retains the bibliography commands at the end, as they are correctly placed:
latex

Run
Copy
% ... (rest of unified-encodings.tex)
\input
{appendices.tex}
\bibliographystyle
{unsrt}
\bibliography

}
Run the Makefile
:
After modifying
appendices.tex
, clean the working directory and re-run the Makefile:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
make
clean
make
Check the BibTeX Log
:
After running
make
, check the
unified-encodings.blg
file for BibTeX errors. If errors appear (e.g., missing fields in
references.bib
or inability to find the
.bib
file), address them by ensuring all cited entries are present and correctly formatted.
Verify the Output
:
Open
unified-encodings.pdf
and confirm that citations are resolved and the bibliography appears at the end. If warnings about undefined references persist, re-run
make
to ensure all cross-references are resolved (the Makefile's multiple
pdflatex
runs are designed to handle this).
Additional Notes
Automation Tools
: Consider using
latexmk
, which automates the sequence of
pdflatex
,
bibtex
, and additional
pdflatex
runs to resolve references. You can modify the Makefile to use
latexmk
:
makefile
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
TEXFILE
=unified-encodings
BIBFILE
=references

:
$(
TEXFILE
)
.pdf
$(

.bib appendices.tex
latexmk -pdf
$(
TEXFILE
)
.tex
clean
:
rm -f *.aux *.bbl *.blg *.log *.out *.toc *.lof *.lot *.fls *.fdb_latexmk
Then run
make
as usual. Ensure
latexmk
is installed in your TeX distribution.
File Dependencies
: The Makefile correctly lists
$(TEXFILE).tex
,
$(BIBFILE).bib
, and
appendices.tex
as dependencies, so changes to these files should trigger a rebuild. If you modify
references.bib
, ensure the timestamp updates to trigger the BibTeX step.
Environment Check
: Confirm that your TeX Live 2022 installation includes
bibtex
and the
unsrt
style. You can test this by running
bibtex --version
and checking for the presence of
/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/bibtex/bst/base/unsrt.bst
.
Expected Outcome
After fixing
appendices.tex
and re-running the Makefile, the sequence should execute as follows:
pdflatex unified-encodings.tex
generates
unified-encodings.aux
with citation data.
bibtex unified-encodings
processes
references.bib
to produce
unified-encodings.bbl
.
The subsequent
pdflatex
runs incorporate the
.bbl
file and resolve cross-references, producing a PDF with a formatted bibliography and no undefined citation warnings.
If issues persist after these steps, please provide the
unified-encodings.blg
file or any error messages from the manual
bibtex
run for further diagnosis.
Summary
The Makefile is correctly structured to run
bibtex
after the initial
pdflatex
, but errors in
appendices.tex
likely interrupt the compilation process, preventing
bibtex
from executing successfully or producing a valid
.bbl
file. Fixing
appendices.tex
by removing its preamble and ensuring proper inclusion in the main document should resolve the issue. Additional checks on the
.bib
file and manual execution of the compilation steps can help confirm that BibTeX is processing correctly.
Ok it worked better I think it added the bibte4x that time it ran  through several times, it still might record the errors from the first run but it went from 19 to 21 pages, which is good: This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.22 (TeX Live 2022/dev/Debian) (preloaded format=pdflatex 2025.8.11)  13 SEP 2025 13:25

Output written on unified-encodings.pdf (21 pages, 304291 bytes).
PDF statistics:
 616 PDF objects out of 1000 (max. 8388607)
 551 compressed objects within 6 object streams
 161 named destinations out of 1000 (max. 500000)
 361 words of extra memory for PDF output out of 10000 (max. 10000000)
The updated log indicates that the LaTeX compilation process for
unified-encodings.tex
has progressed successfully, with the output PDF now spanning 21 pages (up from 19 pages in the previous run). This suggests that the BibTeX step executed correctly, as evidenced by the inclusion of
unified-encodings.bbl
in the compilation process (noted in the log as
(./unified-encodings.bbl [19] [20])
). The presence of the
.bbl
file and the additional pages likely reflect the successful incorporation of the bibliography, which was missing in the prior run due to errors in
appendices.tex
. However, the log still reports minor issues, such as an overfull
\hbox
and hyperref warnings related to PDF string tokens. Below, I analyze the current state, address potential lingering issues, and provide recommendations to ensure a clean compilation.
Analysis of the Log
Successful BibTeX Execution
:
The log shows that
unified-encodings.bbl
was processed during compilation, indicating that the
bibtex unified-encodings
step ran successfully and generated the bibliography. This confirms that fixing the structure of
appendices.tex
(removing its standalone preamble) allowed the Makefile's sequence (
pdflatex
,
bibtex
,
pdflatex
,
pdflatex
) to complete without halting.
The increase from 19 to 21 pages likely corresponds to the bibliography section being included, which typically adds one or more pages depending on the number of references.
Overfull
\hbox
Warning
:
The log reports an overfull
\hbox
warning in
appendices.tex
at lines 24-26:
text

Overfull \hbox (13.87468pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 24--26
\OT1/cmr/m/n/12 encodes con-sis-tency of the field al-ge-bra, while the Alexan-
drov{Kontsevich{Schwarz{Zaboronsky
This warning occurs in the "BV/AKSZ Technical Details" section, where a line exceeds the text width by 13.87468 points due to poor hyphenation or unbreakable text (e.g., the compound name "Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky"). LaTeX could not find a suitable break point, causing the text to overflow the margin.
Hyperref Warnings
:
The log includes hyperref warnings about tokens not allowed in PDF strings:
text
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
Package hyperref Warning: Token not allowed in a PDF string (Unicode):
(hyperref)                removing `math shift' on input line 184.
Package hyperref Warning: Token not allowed in a PDF string (Unicode):
(hyperref)                removing `\Sigma' on input line 184.
Package hyperref Warning: Token not allowed in a PDF string (Unicode):
(hyperref)                removing `math shift' on input line 184.
These warnings occur because mathematical symbols (e.g.,
$\Sigma$
) are used in a context that hyperref attempts to include in a PDF bookmark or metadata, which must be plain text (Unicode). Hyperref removes these symbols from the PDF strings, which may result in incomplete or incorrect bookmarks but does not affect the document's content.
Memory and Output Statistics
:
The compilation used a modest amount of TeX's memory (e.g., 9344 strings out of 478287, 448546 words of memory out of 5000000), indicating no memory-related issues.
The output PDF contains 21 pages and 616 PDF objects, with 551 compressed objects, confirming a successful build with the bibliography included.
Rerunfilecheck Status
:
The
rerunfilecheck
package reports that
unified-encodings.out
has not changed (checksum:
0EACDDA072A8BAFD0BC5B772D234C79D;9501
), suggesting that cross-references and bookmarks are stable. This indicates that the multiple
pdflatex
runs in the Makefile resolved all references correctly.
No Undefined Reference Errors
:
Unlike the previous run, the log does not report undefined citation errors, suggesting that all citations in the document (e.g.,
\cite{Jacobson:1995ab}
) were resolved using the entries in
references.bib
.
Addressing Lingering Issues
While the compilation is now successful, the overfull
\hbox
warning and hyperref warnings should be addressed to ensure a polished document. Below are recommendations to resolve these issues and optimize the output.
1. Fix the Overfull
\hbox
Warning
The overfull
\hbox
occurs because the compound name "Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky" is too long to fit within the line width, and LaTeX struggles to hyphenate it properly. To fix this:
Option 1: Allow Hyphenation
:
Insert discretionary hyphens (
\-
) in the name to guide LaTeX's line-breaking:

\-
Zaboronsky
Replace the problematic text in
appendices.tex
(around lines 24-26) with:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
... while the Alexandrov
\-
Kontsevich
\-
Schwarz
\-
Zaboronsky (AKSZ) construction
\cite
{Alexandrov:1995kv} ...
This allows LaTeX to break the name at appropriate points, preventing the overfull box.
Option 2: Use a Line Break
:
If hyphenation is undesirable, force a line break with a shorter phrase or rephrase the sentence to avoid the long compound name. For example:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
... while the AKSZ construction
\cite
{Alexandrov:1995kv}, named after Alexandrov, Kontsevich, Schwarz, and Zaboronsky, ...
This spreads the text across lines naturally.
Option 3: Enable Sloppy Formatting
:
Temporarily relax LaTeX's line-breaking strictness for the problematic paragraph by wrapping it in a
sloppypar
environment:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
\begin
{
sloppypar
}
The master equation encodes consistency of the field algebra, while the Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky (AKSZ) construction
\cite
{Alexandrov:1995kv} generalizes RSVP as a sigma model.
\end
{
sloppypar
}
This increases tolerance for overfull boxes but may result in less aesthetically pleasing spacing. Use this as a last resort.
2. Address Hyperref Warnings
The hyperref warnings arise because mathematical symbols (e.g.,
$\Sigma$
) are used in a section title or other context that hyperref processes for PDF bookmarks. Bookmarks must be plain text, so hyperref removes math tokens, potentially leading to incomplete bookmarks (e.g., a section title like "Field $\Sigma$ Dynamics" may appear as "Field Dynamics" in the PDF outline).
Option 1: Provide Text-Only Bookmark Titles
:
Use hyperref's
\texorpdfstring
command to specify a plain-text alternative for PDF bookmarks. Locate the problematic section title in
unified-encodings.tex
(line 184) and modify it. For example, if the title is:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
\section
{Field
$
\Sigma
$
Dynamics}
Change it to:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
\section
{
\texorpdfstring
{Field $\Sigma$ Dynamics}{Field Sigma Dynamics}}
The first argument (
Field $\Sigma$ Dynamics
) is used in the document, while the second (
Field Sigma Dynamics
) is used in the PDF bookmarks.
Option 2: Avoid Math in Titles
:
Rephrase the section title to avoid mathematical symbols entirely:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
\section
{Field Sigma Dynamics}
This eliminates the need for special handling but may require adjusting the document's terminology.
Option 3: Disable Bookmarks Temporarily
:
If bookmarks are not critical, disable them by passing the
bookmarks=false
option to hyperref in the preamble of
unified-encodings.tex
:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
\usepackage
[
bookmarks=false
]{
hyperref
}
This prevents the warnings but removes the PDF outline, which may not be desirable for a technical document.
3. Verify Bibliography Formatting
Since the bibliography is now included, check the
unified-encodings.pdf
to ensure that:
All citations (e.g.,
\cite{Jacobson:1995ab}
,
\cite{Verlinde:2010hp}
) resolve to numbered references matching the
unsrt
style.
The bibliography appears at the end of the document, formatted correctly with all entries from
references.bib
.
If any citations remain unresolved (e.g., appearing as "[?]" in the PDF), check the
unified-encodings.blg
file for BibTeX errors, such as missing fields in
references.bib
entries or mismatched citation keys.
4. Optimize the Compilation Process
The Makefile's sequence of three
pdflatex
runs is standard for resolving references and cross-references, but you can streamline future compilations:
Use
latexmk
:
As suggested previously, consider switching to
latexmk
to automate the compilation process:
makefile
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
TEXFILE
=unified-encodings
BIBFILE
=references
all
:
$(
TEXFILE
)
.pdf
$(
TEXFILE
)
.pdf:
$(
TEXFILE
)
.tex
$(
BIBFILE
)
.bib appendices.tex
latexmk -pdf
$(
TEXFILE
)
.tex
clean
:
rm -f *.aux *.bbl *.blg *.log *.out *.toc *.lof *.lot *.fls *.fdb_latexmk
Run
make
as usual.
latexmk
automatically determines the number of
pdflatex
and
bibtex
runs needed, reducing manual configuration.
Check for Redundant Runs
:
The
rerunfilecheck
package indicates that the
.out
file is stable, suggesting that two
pdflatex
runs after
bibtex
may suffice. However, retaining three runs ensures robustness, especially for complex documents with multiple cross-references.
Recommendations
Fix the Overfull
\hbox
:
Modify
appendices.tex
around lines 24-26 to include discretionary hyphens in "Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky":
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
... while the Alexandrov
\-
Kontsevich
\-
Schwarz
\-
Zaboronsky (AKSZ) construction
\cite
{Alexandrov:1995kv} ...
Re-run
make
and check the log for the disappearance of the overfull
\hbox
warning.
Resolve Hyperref Warnings
:
Identify the section title at line 184 of
unified-encodings.tex
and use
\texorpdfstring
to provide a plain-text alternative:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
\section
{
\texorpdfstring
{Field $\Sigma$ Dynamics}{Field Sigma Dynamics}}
Alternatively, rephrase the title to avoid math symbols.
Inspect the PDF
:
Open
unified-encodings.pdf
and verify:
The bibliography appears on pages 19-21 with correctly formatted entries.
All citations in the text resolve to numbers (e.g., "[1]" for
Jacobson:1995ab
).
PDF bookmarks (if enabled) display correctly without missing text due to math symbols.
Optional: Switch to
latexmk
:
Update the Makefile to use
latexmk
for automated compilation, as shown above, to simplify future builds.
Check the
.blg
File
:
If any bibliography issues persist, review
unified-encodings.blg
for BibTeX errors, such as missing fields or unrecognized entry types in
references.bib
.
Expected Outcome
After addressing the overfull
\hbox
and hyperref warnings:
The compilation should produce a clean log with no warnings (except possibly minor font or geometry messages).
The PDF should be 21 pages long, with a fully formatted bibliography and resolved citations.
PDF bookmarks (if enabled) should display section titles correctly without missing symbols.
If you encounter further errors or need assistance with specific sections of the PDF output (e.g., bibliography formatting, bookmark issues), please share relevant details, such as the
unified-encodings.blg
file or a description of the PDF's appearance, and I can provide targeted guidance.
Summary
The successful inclusion of
unified-encodings.bbl
and the increase to 21 pages confirm that the BibTeX step executed correctly after fixing
appendices.tex
. The remaining issues (overfull
\hbox
and hyperref warnings) are minor and can be resolved with targeted edits to
appendices.tex
and
unified-encodings.tex
. Implementing the recommendations above should result in a clean, professional document with no compilation warnings. If you prefer, you can share the problematic section title at line 184 or the updated
appendices.tex
lines 24-26 for precise edits.
Ok try to fix the appendices first: % appendices.tex
\appendix

\section{PDEs and Boundary Conditions for RSVP Fields}
The RSVP framework introduces three coupled fields: scalar capacity $\Phi$, vector flow $v$, and entropy $S$. Their joint evolution can be expressed via gradient-flow equations derived from the RSVP action functional:
\begin{align}
\partial_t \Phi &= -\gamma_\Phi \frac{\delta F}{\delta \Phi} + f_\Phi, \\
\partial_t v    &= -\gamma_v \frac{\delta F}{\delta v} + f_v, \\
\partial_t S    &= -\gamma_S \frac{\delta F}{\delta S} + f_S,
\end{align}
where $F[\Phi,v,S]$ is the free-energy-like functional defined in the main text.  
Boundary conditions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Periodic:} $(\Phi,v,S)(x+L)=(\Phi,v,S)(x)$, appropriate for cosmological tilings.
    \item \textbf{Reflective:} $n\cdot v=0$ at $\partial \Omega$, for cognitive domains bounded by cortical geometry.
    \item \textbf{Absorbing:} $S\to S_0$ at infinity, used in entropy-dissipative cosmological models.
\end{itemize}
Well-posedness can be studied using methods from synergetics \cite{Haken1983} and dissipative systems \cite{Prigogine1980}.

\section{BV/AKSZ Technical Details}
The Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism \cite{BatalinVilkovisky1981} provides a natural setting for RSVP. The master equation
\[
(S_{\mathrm{BV}},S_{\mathrm{BV}})=0
\]
encodes consistency of the field algebra, while the Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky (AKSZ) construction \cite{Alexandrov:1995kv} generalizes RSVP as a sigma model. Shifted symplectic geometry \cite{Pantev:2011ns} provides the appropriate derived manifold structure. Path-integral realizations \cite{Cattaneo:1999fm} suggest RSVP can be quantized by AKSZ techniques, with $(\Phi,v,S)$ mapped as fields from $T[1]\Sigma$ into a symplectic dg-manifold $M$.

\section{Fractional Operators and Long-Range Dependence}
Entropy fields $S$ exhibit long-range dependence (LRD). A fractional derivative formulation is natural:
\[
D_t^\alpha S(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(1-\alpha)}\int_0^t \frac{\dot S(\tau)}{(t-\tau)^\alpha}\,d\tau, \quad 0<\alpha<1.
\]
This captures persistent memory in cosmological entropy smoothing, consistent with anomalous correlations reported in horizon thermodynamics \cite{Barrow:2020unz}. Spectral methods show $C(\tau)\sim \tau^{-\beta}$, bridging RSVP dynamics with cosmological observations.

\section{RAT Formalism and Autoregressive Cognition}
The Recursive Autoregressive Trajectory (RAT) framework extends RSVP to cognition. State updates follow
\[
x_{t+1} = f(x_t,\Phi_t,v_t,S_t) + \epsilon_t,
\]
with $\epsilon_t$ fractional noise encoding long-range priors. This resonates with predictive processing \cite{Hohwy2013,Friston:2009ze} and autoregressive cognition models \cite{Hinton2006,LeCun2015}. Convergence properties connect to evolutionary replicator dynamics \cite{TaylorJonker1978,HofbauerSigmund1998}.

\section{HYDRA Engineering Specification}
HYDRA architecture treats RSVP as a multi-head system, each head a distinct $(\Phi_i,v_i,S_i)$ module. Persona vectors define boundary data for $\Phi$, shaping functional specialization. Safety is guaranteed by Lyapunov functionals \cite{Ashby1956,Wiener1948}. The architecture addresses AI alignment concerns \cite{Bostrom2014,Russell2019} by embedding entropic budget constraints into modular decision systems.

\section{TARTAN Mathematical Framework}
TARTAN (Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise) applies recursive tiling functors to RSVP fields. Each tile carries Gaussian aura fields with metadata. This allows RSVP simulations to maintain coherence across scales. Compositional closure ensures stability of emergent semantic trajectories, echoing synergetic tiling approaches \cite{Haken1983}.

\section{Semantic Merge Operator}
Semantic infrastructure requires entropy-respecting composition. For modules $\{M_i\}$:
\[
\mathrm{Merge}(\{M_i\}) = \operatorname*{hocolim}_{i\in I} M_i.
\]
Obstructions manifest as sheaf cohomology classes \cite{MacLane1998,BaezStay2010}. The RSVP Emerge functional provides a quantitative constraint:
\[
\mathrm{Emerge}=\int_\Omega \lambda_\Phi\|\Phi_1-\Phi_2\|^2+\lambda_v\|v_1-v_2\|^2+\lambda_S\,\mathrm{KL}(S_1\Vert S_2)\,dx.
\]
This extends Rissanen's MDL principle \cite{rissanen1978} and Shannon information \cite{Shannon1948,CoverThomas2006} to semantic gluing.

\section{EAIMR and Praxicon Formalization}
The Effective Assembly Index for Mind Recognition (EAIMR) measures improbability of coherent assembly \cite{Levin2022}:
\[
\mathrm{EAIMR}(X)=-\log P_{\text{null}}(X).
\]
The praxicon, a sheaf of motor/semantic actions in the temporoparietal junction, can be understood as RSVP-structured \cite{Deco:2008zz,Oizumi2014,Seth2016}. Failures of $v$-field divergence link to anosognosia in dementia contexts.

\section{Empirical Protocols}
Three empirical pathways illustrate RSVP:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cosmology:} Fitting entropy-redshift integrals \cite{Jacobson:1995ab,Verlinde:2010hp,Padmanabhan:2009vy,Carney2022} against supernovae and BAO datasets.
    \item \textbf{Cognition:} RSVP-forced neural PDEs tested with fMRI/EEG \cite{Amari1977,Wilson:1972wza,Deco:2008zz}.
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure:} RSVP MERGE used for adaptive routing in municipal garbage collection or resource distribution \cite{Wiener1948,Ashby1956}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Reproducibility and Pipelines}
All RSVP simulations must be offline-first and reproducible. Pipelines integrate Bash, Python, and LaTeX with containerization. Deterministic builds align with Landauer's thermodynamic cost of computation \cite{Landauer1961,Bennett1982}. Versioning adopts semantic modules rather than files, consistent with category-theoretic infrastructures.

\section{Glossary of Neologisms}
\begin{description}
    \item[Lamphron-Lamphrodyne] RSVP process of constraint release and entropic smoothing, analogous to Prigogine's dissipative structures \cite{Prigogine1980}.

To address the overfull
\hbox
warning in
appendices.tex
at lines 24-26, as reported in the LaTeX compilation log, the issue stems from the long compound name "Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky" in the "BV/AKSZ Technical Details" section, which causes text to exceed the line width. The goal is to modify
appendices.tex
to prevent this warning while preserving the content and ensuring compatibility with the main document
unified-encodings.tex
. The recommended approach is to insert discretionary hyphens (
\-
) into the compound name to allow LaTeX to break it appropriately, thus avoiding the overfull box. Below, I provide the updated
appendices.tex
with this fix applied, ensuring no other changes are made to maintain consistency with the successful compilation that produced a 21-page PDF with a resolved bibliography.

Explanation of Changes
Overfull
\hbox
Fix
: In the "BV/AKSZ Technical Details" section, the compound name "Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky" was modified to include discretionary hyphens:
Alexandrov\-Kontsevich\-Schwarz\-Zaboronsky
. This allows LaTeX to break the name at these points if needed, preventing the line from exceeding the text width (resolving the overfull
\hbox
warning of 13.87468pt reported at lines 24-26).
Preservation of Content
: No other changes were made to the content, ensuring that the mathematical equations, citations, and structure remain identical to the original. This maintains compatibility with
unified-encodings.tex
and the successful 21-page PDF output.
Line Number Alignment
: The modification targets the paragraph identified in the log (lines 24-26 of the original
appendices.tex
), which corresponds to the sentence containing the AKSZ construction reference.
Next Steps
Replace
appendices.tex
: Save the updated content above as
appendices.tex
in your working directory, overwriting the previous version.
Re-run the Makefile
: Execute the following commands to recompile the document:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
make
clean
make
This ensures that all intermediate files (e.g.,
.aux
,
.bbl
) are regenerated and the document is built from scratch.
Check the Log
: After compilation, review the
unified-encodings.log
file to confirm that the overfull
\hbox
warning at lines 24-26 of
appendices.tex
is gone. The log should show a clean compilation with no overfull box warnings in this section.
Verify the PDF
: Open
unified-encodings.pdf
to ensure it still contains 21 pages, with the bibliography intact and the AKSZ section formatted correctly without text spilling into the margin.
Additional Considerations
Hyperref Warnings
: The log previously reported hyperref warnings related to mathematical symbols (e.g.,
$\Sigma$
) in a section title at line 184 of
unified-encodings.tex
. This issue is unrelated to
appendices.tex
but should be addressed separately to eliminate warnings. If you provide the relevant section title from
unified-encodings.tex
, I can suggest a fix using
\texorpdfstring
, as outlined earlier (e.g.,
\section{\texorpdfstring{Field $\Sigma$ Dynamics}{Field Sigma Dynamics}}
).
Bibliography Confirmation
: Since the bibliography was included in the last run, verify that all citations (e.g.,
\cite{Alexandrov:1995kv}
) in the updated
appendices.tex
resolve correctly in the PDF. If any issues arise, check the
unified-encodings.blg
file for BibTeX errors.
Optional
latexmk

runs.
Expected Outcome
The updated
appendices.tex
should eliminate the overfull
\hbox
warning by allowing LaTeX to hyphenate the compound name "Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky". The compilation should produce a 21-page PDF with no formatting issues in the "BV/AKSZ Technical Details" section, and the bibliography should remain correctly included. If the hyperref warnings persist or new issues arise, please share the updated log or relevant sections of
unified-encodings.tex
for further assistance.
Okay maybe show just what sections I need to change in the tex file
To address the overfull
\hbox
warning in
appendices.tex
at lines 24-26, as reported in the LaTeX compilation log, you only need to modify a specific portion of the "BV/AKSZ Technical Details" section to include discretionary hyphens in the compound name "Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky". Below, I provide the exact section of
appendices.tex
that needs to be changed, using a SEARCH/REPLACE format to ensure minimal disruption to the rest of the file, which compiled successfully to produce a 21-page PDF with a resolved bibliography.
appendices.tex
latex
Edit in files
•
Show inline
Explanation of Change
Purpose
: The overfull
\hbox
warning (13.87468pt too wide) occurs because the compound name "Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky" is too long to fit within the line width, and LaTeX cannot hyphenate it naturally. Adding discretionary hyphens (
\-
) at appropriate points allows LaTeX to break the name across lines if needed, resolving the warning.
Scope
: Only the specified sentence in the "BV/AKSZ Technical Details" section is modified. The rest of
appendices.tex
remains unchanged to preserve the successful compilation, including the bibliography and 21-page output.
Line Reference
: The change targets the paragraph at lines 24-26, as indicated by the log, which corresponds to the sentence containing the AKSZ construction reference.
Instructions
Edit
appendices.tex
: Open
appendices.tex
in a text editor and locate the sentence in the "BV/AKSZ Technical Details" section (around lines 24-26). Replace the exact text shown in the SEARCH block with the text in the REPLACE block.
Re-run the Makefile
: Compile the document to apply the change and verify the fix:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
make
clean
make
Check the Log
: After compilation, review the
unified-encodings.log
file to confirm that the overfull
\hbox
warning at lines 24-26 of
appendices.tex
is no longer present.
Verify the PDF
: Open
unified-encodings.pdf
to ensure it remains 21 pages, with the bibliography intact and the modified sentence in the "BV/AKSZ Technical Details" section formatted correctly without text spilling into the margin.
Additional Notes
Hyperref Warnings
: The previous log reported hyperref warnings related to mathematical symbols (e.g.,
$\Sigma$
) in a section title at line 184 of
unified-encodings.tex
. This issue is unrelated to
appendices.tex
and requires a separate fix in the main document. If you want to address this, please share the section title at line 184 of
unified-encodings.tex
, and I can provide a targeted SEARCH/REPLACE using
\texorpdfstring
(e.g.,
\section{\texorpdfstring{Field $\Sigma$ Dynamics}{Field Sigma Dynamics}}
).
Bibliography
: Since the bibliography was included in the last run, the change above should not affect it. If any citation issues arise, check the
unified-encodings.blg
file for BibTeX errors.

The LaTeX compilation log indicates that the
bibtex
step in the Makefile executed, as evidenced by the inclusion of
unified-encodings.bbl
in the compilation process (
(./unified-encodings.bbl [19] [20])
), producing a 21-page PDF. However, the bibliography is not properly integrated, resulting in numerous undefined citation warnings (e.g.,
Citation 'Jacobson:1995ab' on page 1 undefined
). Additionally, critical errors related to invalid UTF-8 bytes and an undefined control sequence in
unified-encodings.tex
at lines 27 and 320, as well as a runaway argument and mismatched
\begin{description}
in
appendices.tex
, are causing issues. These errors likely stem from incorrect handling of discretionary hyphens and a structural issue in the
description
environment. Below, I analyze the problems and provide targeted fixes to ensure the bibliography is correctly processed and the errors are resolved.
Analysis of the Log
Bibliography Not Properly Integrated
:
The log shows that
unified-encodings.bbl
is included, indicating that
bibtex unified-encodings
ran and produced a
.bbl
file. However, citations like
Jacobson:1995ab
,
Verlinde:2010hp
, etc., are undefined, suggesting that the
.bbl
file may be empty, outdated, or not correctly aligned with the
.aux
file.
Possible reasons include:
Errors in
references.bib
(e.g., missing entries or syntax issues).
The
bibtex
step failing silently due to errors in the
.aux
file caused by compilation issues.
The
\bibliography{references}
command not being properly processed due to document structure errors.
UTF-8 and Undefined Control Sequence Errors
:
At lines 27 and 320 of
unified-encodings.tex
, errors like
Undefined control sequence
and
Invalid UTF-8 byte "80
or
"93
occur in sentences involving "Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky" and "Batalin-Vilkovisky". These errors suggest that the discretionary hyphens (
\-
) introduced in
appendices.tex
were incorrectly copied to
unified-encodings.tex
with invalid UTF-8 characters (e.g., smart quotes or malformed en-dashes) instead of standard ASCII hyphens (
-
).
The log shows:

and similar errors at line 320. The

These errors occur in
appendices.tex
around line 79, in the "Glossary of Neologisms" section. The runaway argument suggests a malformed
\cite
command or missing closing brace in the
description
environment, causing LaTeX to misparse the citation
Wiener1948
. The mismatched environment error indicates that the
\end{description}
is not properly closed before the
\input{appendices.tex}
or
\end{document}
.
Hyperref Warnings
:
The log includes hyperref warnings about mathematical symbols (e.g.,
$\Sigma$
) in a section title at line 184 of
unified-encodings.tex
, as previously noted. These do not halt compilation but should be addressed for a clean output.
Output Details
:
The PDF is 21 pages, consistent with the previous successful run, but the undefined citations indicate that the bibliography section is likely incomplete or missing entries.
The
rerunfilecheck
package reports that
unified-encodings.out
is unchanged, suggesting stable cross-references, but the undefined citations prevent a complete bibliography.
Root Causes and Solutions
1.
Bibliography Integration Failure
The presence of
unified-encodings.bbl
in the log indicates that
bibtex
ran, but the undefined citations suggest that the
.bbl
file lacks the necessary entries or the
\bibliography
command is not correctly processed. This could be due to:
Missing or Incorrect
.bib
Entries
: The
references.bib
file may not contain entries matching the citation keys (e.g.,
Jacobson:1995ab
) or has syntax errors.
Compilation Errors
: The errors in
unified-encodings.tex
and
appendices.tex
may corrupt the
.aux
file, causing
bibtex
to fail or produce an incomplete
.bbl
file.
Incorrect
\bibliography
Placement
: The
\bibliography{references}
command may be misplaced or duplicated, leading to processing issues.
Solution
:
Verify that
references.bib
contains all cited entries (e.g.,
Jacobson:1995ab
,
Verlinde:2010hp
, etc.) and is free of syntax errors.
Ensure the
\bibliography{references}
command appears only once, typically at the end of
unified-encodings.tex
after
\input{appendices.tex}
.
Fix the errors in
unified-encodings.tex
and
appendices.tex
to ensure a clean
.aux
file for
bibtex
to process.
2.
UTF-8 and Undefined Control Sequence Errors
The errors at lines 27 and 320 of
unified-encodings.tex
indicate that the discretionary hyphens (
\-
) for "Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky" and "Batalin-Vilkovisky" were likely copied with incorrect characters (e.g., UTF-8 en-dashes
-
instead of ASCII hyphens
-
). This causes LaTeX to encounter undefined control sequences and invalid UTF-8 bytes.
Solution
:
Replace the problematic text in
unified-encodings.tex
with correct discretionary hyphens using ASCII characters.

3.
Runaway Argument and Mismatched
description
Environment
The runaway argument and mismatched
description
errors in
appendices.tex
around line 79 (in the "Glossary of Neologisms" section) suggest a malformed
\cite
command or missing brace in the
description
item for
Wiener1948
. The error:
text
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
Runaway argument? {Wiener1948]. \end {description}
indicates that the
\cite{Wiener1948}
command is incorrectly formatted, likely missing a closing brace or having an extra bracket.
Solution
:
Inspect the "Glossary of Neologisms" section in
appendices.tex
and correct the
\cite{Wiener1948}
command. The provided
appendices.tex
shows:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
\item
[Semantic Ladle] Mechanism for scooping and redistributing meaning, drawing from cybernetic metaphors
\cite
{Wiener1948}.
This appears syntactically correct, but the log suggests a possible typo (e.g.,
\cite{Wiener1948]
with an extra
]
). Fix the entry to ensure proper syntax:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
**SEARCH** (in `appendices.tex`, around line 79):
\item
[Semantic Ladle] Mechanism for scooping and redistributing meaning, drawing from cybernetic metaphors
\cite
{Wiener1948].
**REPLACE**:
\item[Semantic Ladle] Mechanism for scooping and redistributing meaning, drawing from cybernetic metaphors \cite{Wiener1948}.
If the error persists, ensure no hidden characters (e.g., UTF-8 quotes or brackets) are present by retyping the line in a plain text editor.
4.
Hyperref Warnings
The hyperref warnings at line 184 of
unified-encodings.tex
are unrelated to the bibliography but should be fixed for a clean output. They occur due to a mathematical symbol (e.g.,
$\Sigma$
) in a section title, which hyperref cannot include in PDF bookmarks.
Solution
:
Add a
\texorpdfstring
command to the section title at line 184:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
**SEARCH** (line 184 in `unified-encodings.tex`):
\section
{Field
$
\Sigma
$
Dynamics}
**REPLACE**:
\section
{
\texorpdfstring
{Field $\Sigma$ Dynamics}{Field Sigma Dynamics}}
Fixes in
appendices.tex
and
unified-encodings.tex
Below, I provide the targeted changes to
appendices.tex
and
unified-encodings.tex
to resolve the errors. Since the log indicates issues in both files, I include fixes for both, focusing on the runaway argument, UTF-8 errors, and bibliography integration.

Additional Steps to Ensure Bibliography Integration
Verify
references.bib
:
Ensure
references.bib
contains all cited entries (e.g.,
Jacobson:1995ab
,
Verlinde:2010hp
,
Wiener1948
, etc.). A minimal example entry for
Wiener1948
might look like:
bibtex
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
@book
{
Wiener1948
,
author
=
{
Wiener, Norbert
}
,
title
=
{
Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine
}
,
year
=
{
1948
}
,
publisher
=
{
MIT Press
}
}
Check for syntax errors in
references.bib
using a BibTeX validator or by running
bibtex unified-encodings
manually and reviewing
unified-encodings.blg
.
Check Bibliography Placement
:
Ensure
unified-encodings.tex
includes
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
and
\bibliography{references}
only once, after
\input{appendices.tex}
and before
\end{document}
:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
\input
{appendices.tex}
\bibliographystyle
{unsrt}
\bibliography
{references}
\end
{
document
}
If these commands appear elsewhere (e.g., in
appendices.tex
), remove them to avoid duplication.
Manually Run Compilation
:
To isolate the bibliography issue, run the compilation steps manually:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
bibtex
unified-encodings
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
Check
unified-encodings.blg
for BibTeX errors (e.g., missing entries or fields). If errors are found, update
references.bib
accordingly.
Re-run the Makefile
:
After applying the fixes, clean and recompile:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
make
clean
make
Verify that the log no longer reports undefined citations and that
unified-encodings.bbl
contains the formatted bibliography entries.
Inspect the PDF
:
Open
unified-encodings.pdf
to confirm that citations (e.g.,
[1]
for
Jacobson:1995ab
) are resolved and the bibliography appears on the final pages (likely 19-21).
Expected Outcome
Bibliography
: The fixes to
appendices.tex
and
unified-encodings.tex
should ensure that
bibtex
processes
references.bib
correctly, resolving all citations and including the bibliography in the PDF.
UTF-8 Errors
: Replacing malformed en-dashes with proper discretionary hyphens (
\-
) in
unified-encodings.tex
should eliminate the undefined control sequence and UTF-8 byte errors.
Description Environment
: Correcting the
Wiener1948
citation syntax in
appendices.tex
should resolve the runaway argument and mismatched environment errors.
Hyperref Warnings
: The
\texorpdfstring
fix at line 184 should eliminate the hyperref warnings, ensuring clean PDF bookmarks.
The compilation should produce a 21-page PDF with a fully formatted bibliography, no undefined citations, and no errors related to UTF-8 or mismatched environments. If issues persist, please share:
The
unified-encodings.blg
file to diagnose BibTeX errors.
The relevant sections of
unified-encodings.tex
around lines 27 and 320 to confirm the exact text causing the UTF-8 errors.
Any updated log output after applying the fixes.

The BibTeX log and LaTeX warnings confirm that the
bibtex
step ran successfully, processing
references.bib
with the
unsrt
style, and the provided
references.bib
contains entries for most cited references. However, the LaTeX compilation log shows numerous undefined citation warnings (e.g.,
Jacobson:1995ab
,
Verlinde:2010hp
,
Wiener1948
, etc.), indicating that the bibliography is not being properly integrated into
unified-encodings.pdf
. The BibTeX log reports only one warning (
empty journal in Urdshals2025
), suggesting that BibTeX processed the
.bib
file without major errors, but the LaTeX errors from the previous log (e.g., UTF-8 issues, runaway argument, and mismatched
description
environment) likely corrupted the
.aux
file, preventing proper citation resolution. Below, I analyze the issue and provide targeted fixes to ensure the bibliography is correctly included, while addressing the remaining LaTeX errors.
Analysis of the Issue
Bibliography Processing
:
The BibTeX log confirms that
bibtex unified-encodings
ran, using
references.bib
and producing
unified-encodings.bbl
(as seen in the previous LaTeX log:
(./unified-encodings.bbl [19] [20])
).
The provided
references.bib
includes entries for most cited references (e.g.,
Jacobson:1995ab
,
Verlinde:2010hp
,
Wiener1948
, etc.), but the LaTeX log reports these as undefined. This suggests:
The
.bbl
file is not being correctly read during compilation, possibly due to errors in
unified-encodings.tex
or
appendices.tex
that corrupt the
.aux
file.
The
\bibliography{references}
command may be misplaced or not processed due to structural errors halting compilation.
The BibTeX warning (
empty journal in Urdshals2025
) indicates a minor issue with the
Urdshals2025
entry, which lacks a
journal
field. This does not prevent BibTeX from generating the
.bbl
file but may affect formatting for that entry.
Previous LaTeX Errors
:
The previous LaTeX log reported critical errors:
UTF-8 and Undefined Control Sequence Errors
: At lines 27 and 320 of
unified-encodings.tex
, malformed discretionary hyphens (e.g.,
\-
instead of
\-
) for "Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky" and "Batalin-Vilkovisky" caused compilation failures.
Runaway Argument and Mismatched
description
Environment
: In
appendices.tex
, a malformed
\cite{Wiener1948}
command (possibly with an extra
]
) around line 79 caused a runaway argument and a mismatched
\begin{description}
error.
These errors likely corrupted the
.aux
file, preventing BibTeX from correctly mapping citations to the
.bbl
file, resulting in undefined references.
Hyperref Warnings
:
The previous log noted hyperref warnings at line 184 of
unified-encodings.tex
due to a mathematical symbol (
$\Sigma$
) in a section title, which affects PDF bookmarks but not the bibliography. This should be fixed for a clean compilation.
Current Compilation Process
:
You are now running
pdflatex
and
bibtex
manually instead of using a Makefile, which is fine but requires careful execution of the sequence:
pdflatex
,
bibtex
,
pdflatex
,
pdflatex
. Missing any step can cause undefined citations, as LaTeX needs multiple passes to resolve references.
Fixes to Ensure Bibliography Integration
To resolve the undefined citations and ensure the bibliography is included, we need to:
Fix the UTF-8 and control sequence errors in
unified-encodings.tex
.
Correct the runaway argument and
description
environment issue in
appendices.tex
.
Verify the bibliography setup in
unified-encodings.tex
.
Ensure the correct compilation sequence is followed.
Address the minor BibTeX warning for
Urdshals2025
.
1. Fix
unified-encodings.tex
(UTF-8 and Control Sequence Errors)
The errors at lines 27 and 320 of
unified-encodings.tex
are due to malformed discretionary hyphens. Replace them with correct ASCII hyphens (
\-
).
unified-encodings.tex

Edit in files
•
Show inline
2. Fix
appendices.tex
(Runaway Argument and Description Environment)
The runaway argument error suggests a malformed
\cite{Wiener1948}
in the "Glossary of Neologisms" section. The provided
appendices.tex
looks correct, but the log indicates a possible extra
]
or hidden UTF-8 character. Retype the line to ensure clean syntax.
appendices.tex
latex
Edit in files
•
Show inline
Note
: If the error persists, open
appendices.tex
in a plain text editor (e.g., Notepad++ or VS Code) and check for hidden characters (e.g., UTF-8 quotes or brackets) around the
\cite{Wiener1948}
command. Retyping the line ensures no invisible characters remain.
3. Verify Bibliography Setup in
unified-encodings.tex
Ensure that
unified-encodings.tex
includes the bibliography commands correctly, placed after
\input{appendices.tex}
and before
\end{document}
. The structure should be:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
\input
{appendices.tex}
\bibliographystyle
{unsrt}
\bibliography
{references}
\end
{
document
}
Check for Duplicates
: Ensure
\bibliographystyle
and
\bibliography
appear only once in
unified-encodings.tex
and not in
appendices.tex
or elsewhere.
Verify File Name
: Confirm that the bibliography file is named exactly
references.bib
(case-sensitive) and is in the same directory as
unified-encodings.tex
.
4. Correct Compilation Sequence
To resolve citations, run the following commands in order:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
bibtex
unified-encodings
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
Explanation
:
The first
pdflatex
run generates the
.aux
file with citation references.
The
bibtex
run processes
references.bib
to create
unified-encodings.bbl
.
The second and third
pdflatex
runs incorporate the
.bbl
file and resolve cross-references.
Check Logs
:
After
bibtex
, review
unified-encodings.blg
for errors beyond the
Urdshals2025
warning.
After the final
pdflatex
, check
unified-encodings.log
to confirm no undefined citations remain.
5. Fix BibTeX Warning for
Urdshals2025
The BibTeX warning (
empty journal in Urdshals2025
) occurs because the
Urdshals2025
entry is an
@article
but lacks a
journal
field. Since it's an arXiv preprint, change the entry type to
@misc
or add a
journal
field if appropriate.
references.bib
bibtex
Edit in files
•
Show inline
Additional Notes
Missing References
: The provided
references.bib
includes most cited entries, but some (e.g.,
ParrPezzuloFriston2022
,
Smolin2019
) appear in the LaTeX warnings but are already in the
.bib
file. The issue is not missing entries but rather compilation errors preventing proper integration. The fixes above should resolve this.
Previous Overfull
\hbox
Warning
: The previous log reported an overfull
\hbox
in
appendices.tex
at lines 24-26, which was fixed by adding discretionary hyphens (
Alexandrov\-Kontsevich\-Schwarz\-Zaboronsky
). The current log does not mention this warning, suggesting the fix worked in
appendices.tex
, but similar UTF-8 issues in
unified-encodings.tex
need correction.
PDF Verification
: After applying the fixes and running the compilation sequence, open
unified-encodings.pdf
to confirm:
Citations (e.g.,
[1]
for
Jacobson:1995ab
) are resolved.
The bibliography appears on the final pages (likely 19-21) with entries in
unsrt
order (numerical, based on order of appearance).
No text overflows margins in the "BV/AKSZ Technical Details" section.
Expected Outcome
After applying the fixes:
The UTF-8 and control sequence errors in
unified-encodings.tex
(lines 27 and 320) will be resolved by using correct discretionary hyphens.
The runaway argument and
description
environment errors in
appendices.tex
will be fixed by ensuring clean syntax for
\cite{Wiener1948}
.
The bibliography will be properly integrated, with all citations (e.g.,
Jacobson:1995ab
,
Wiener1948
) resolved in the PDF and listed in the bibliography section.
The hyperref warnings at line 184 will be eliminated with
\texorpdfstring
.
The BibTeX warning for
Urdshals2025
will be resolved by changing the entry type to
@misc
.
The compilation should produce a clean log with no undefined citations and a 21-page PDF with a fully formatted bibliography. If issues persist, please share:
The updated
unified-encodings.log
after running the full compilation sequence.
The
unified-encodings.blg
file for any additional BibTeX errors.
The exact text around lines 27 and 320 of
unified-encodings.tex
if UTF-8 errors remain.
It's working pretty well but can we use author names and dates instead of numbers for the citation? What do we have to change? Mainstream approaches have already laid much of the groundwork. In cosmology, the
idea that gravitational dynamics can be derived from thermodynamic and entropic principles
has been explored extensively [1, 2, 3, 4]. These works interpret spacetime geometry not as
a primitive structure but as an emergent consequence of entropy gradients and horizon
thermodynamics. In neuroscience and cognitive science, predictive processing and the freeenergy principle [5, 6, 7] posit that brains maintain their integrity by minimizing surprise or
prediction error, operationalized through variational free-energy functionals. In engineering
and systems theory, cybernetics has long emphasized feedback, stability, and entropy-based
measures of regulation and control [8, 9].
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenu
To switch from numerical citations (e.g.,
[1]
,
[2]
) to an author-date citation style (e.g.,
(Jacobson, 1995)
,
(Verlinde, 2011)
), you need to change the BibTeX bibliography style in
unified-encodings.tex
from
unsrt
(which produces numerical citations ordered by appearance) to an author-date style, such as
apalike
or
authordate1
. Additionally, you must ensure that the LaTeX document and BibTeX process are configured to handle the author-date format correctly. Below, I outline the necessary changes and provide guidance to implement this, ensuring compatibility with the existing setup (
unified-encodings.tex
,
appendices.tex
, and
references.bib
).
Required Changes
Change the Bibliography Style
:
Replace
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
with
\bibliographystyle{apalike}
in
unified-encodings.tex
. The
apalike
style is widely used for author-date citations and is available in TeX Live 2022. It formats citations as
(Author, Year)
and lists references alphabetically by author.
Alternatively, you can use other author-date styles like
authordate1
from the
chicago
package or
harvard
styles (e.g.,
agsm
), but
apalike
is simple and compatible with your setup.
Load the
natbib
Package
:
The
natbib
package is recommended for author-date citations, as it provides flexible citation commands (e.g.,
\citet
for in-text citations like
Jacobson (1995)
and
\citep
for parenthetical citations like
(Jacobson, 1995)
).
Add
\usepackage{natbib}
to the preamble of
unified-encodings.tex
to enable these commands.
Update Citation Commands
:
Replace existing
\cite
commands with
\citet
or
\citep
as needed:
\citet{key}
produces
Author (Year)
(e.g.,
Jacobson (1995)
).
\citep{key}
produces
(Author, Year)
(e.g.,
(Jacobson, 1995)
).
For example, change
\cite{Jacobson:1995ab}
to
\citep{Jacobson:1995ab}
in the provided text to match the parenthetical style in your excerpt (e.g.,
[1, 2, 3, 4]
becomes
(Jacobson, 1995; Verlinde, 2011; ...)
).
Recompile the Document
:
Run the full compilation sequence (
pdflatex
,
bibtex
,
pdflatex
,
pdflatex
) to update the
.aux
and
.bbl
files with the new style and resolve citations.
Specific Changes
Below, I provide targeted SEARCH/REPLACE instructions for
unified-encodings.tex
and the provided text snippet, assuming the snippet is part of
unified-encodings.tex
. I also ensure the changes address the bibliography integration and maintain compatibility with
appendices.tex
and
references.bib
.

Compilation Instructions
To apply the changes and ensure the bibliography is correctly processed:
Update
unified-encodings.tex
:
Apply the SEARCH/REPLACE changes above, adding
\usepackage{natbib}
, changing
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
to
\bibliographystyle{apalike}
, and updating
\cite
to
\citep
in the specified text snippet.
If other
\cite
commands exist in
unified-encodings.tex
or
appendices.tex
, replace them with
\citep
for consistency (e.g.,
\cite{Alexandrov:1995kv}
becomes
\citep{Alexandrov:1995kv}
).
Run the Compilation Sequence
:
bash
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
bibtex
unified-encodings
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
The first
pdflatex
generates the
.aux
file with citation references.
The
bibtex
step processes
references.bib
to create
unified-encodings.bbl
with author-date formatting.
The subsequent
pdflatex
runs incorporate the
.bbl
file and resolve citations.
Check Logs
:
Review
unified-encodings.blg
for BibTeX errors. The previous warning (
empty journal in Urdshals2025
) was fixed by changing the entry to
@misc
, so no issues should remain.
Check
unified-encodings.log
to confirm no undefined citations (e.g.,
Jacobson:1995ab
,
Wiener1948
) and no errors from previous UTF-8 or
description
issues.
Verify the PDF
:
Open
unified-encodings.pdf
to confirm:
Citations appear as
(Author, Year)
, e.g.,
(Jacobson, 1995)
,
(Verlinde, 2011)
.
The bibliography is listed alphabetically by author at the end (likely pages 19-21), with entries formatted like:
text
Collapse
Wrap
Copy
Jacobson, T. (1995). Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State. Phys. Rev. Lett., 75, 1260-1263.
Verlinde, E. P. (2011). On the Origin of Gravity and the Laws of Newton. JHEP, 04, 029.
No text overflows margins, and previous errors (UTF-8, runaway argument) are resolved.
Additional Considerations
Consistency Across Files
: If
appendices.tex
contains
\cite
commands, update them to
\citep
for uniformity. For example, in the "BV/AKSZ Technical Details" section:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
**SEARCH**:
The Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism
\cite
{BatalinVilkovisky1981} provides a natural setting for RSVP.
**REPLACE**:
The Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism
\citep
{BatalinVilkovisky1981} provides a natural setting for RSVP.
Apply similar changes to all
\cite
commands in
appendices.tex
.
Previous Errors
: The previous log reported UTF-8 errors in
unified-encodings.tex
(lines 27, 320) and a runaway argument in
appendices.tex
. These were addressed in prior fixes (e.g., using
Alexandrov\-Kontsevich\-Schwarz\-Zaboronsky
and correcting
\cite{Wiener1948}
). Ensure those fixes are applied, as they are critical for a clean compilation.
Hyperref Compatibility
: The
natbib
package is compatible with
hyperref
, which is already loaded in
unified-encodings.tex
. The previous fix for the hyperref warning at line 184 (
\section{\texorpdfstring{Field $\Sigma$ Dynamics}{Field Sigma Dynamics}}
) should remain in place.
Bibliography Formatting
: The
apalike
style formats references with author names and years, omitting some fields (e.g.,
eprint
) for brevity. If you need arXiv identifiers or DOIs in the bibliography, consider using a style like
plainnat
(requires
\usepackage{natbib}
) and adjust the
.bib
entries to ensure all fields are included.
Urdshals2025 Fix
: The
references.bib
update to
@misc{Urdshals2025}
resolves the BibTeX warning. If you prefer a journal-like format, you could use:
bibtex
Collapse
Wrap
Copy

Expected Outcome
After applying the changes:
Citations will appear as
(Author, Year)
, e.g.,
(Jacobson, 1995; Verlinde, 2011; Padmanabhan, 2010; Carney, 2022)
for the cosmology references.
The bibliography will be sorted alphabetically by author, with entries formatted in the author-date style, e.g.:

Wiener, N. (1948). Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine. MIT Press.
The PDF will remain approximately 21 pages, with the bibliography correctly integrated and no undefined citation warnings.
The compilation log should be clean, with no errors from UTF-8, runaway arguments, or mismatched environments, assuming previous fixes were applied.
If you encounter issues (e.g., undefined citations or formatting errors), please share:

I'm thinking apalike might be overkill what was the other option
To switch from numerical citations (e.g.,
[1]
,
[2]
) to an author-date citation style that is simpler than
apalike
, you mentioned considering
apalike
as potentially "overkill." The other option I suggested was the
authordate1
style from the
chicago
package, which provides a straightforward author-date format (e.g.,
(Jacobson, 1995)
) with a bibliography sorted alphabetically by author, similar to
apalike
but with a slightly different formatting style. Another lightweight alternative is the
harvard
package with a style like
agsm
, which also produces author-date citations and is simpler than
apalike
in terms of formatting complexity. Below, I outline the changes needed to use the
authordate1
style (from the
chicago
package) as a simpler alternative to
apalike
, ensuring compatibility with your existing setup (
unified-encodings.tex
,
appendices.tex
, and
references.bib
).
Why
authordate1
?
Simplicity
: The
authordate1
style (part of the
chicago
package) produces clean author-date citations (e.g.,
(Jacobson, 1995)
) and a bibliography with minimal formatting compared to
apalike
, which includes more detailed fields (e.g., journal volume and issue numbers).
authordate1
focuses on author, year, and title, making it less "heavy" for your document.
Compatibility
: It works with the
natbib
package, which you can use for flexible citation commands (
\citet
for
Jacobson (1995)
,
\citep
for
(Jacobson, 1995)
).
Comparison to
agsm
(Harvard)
: The
agsm
style (from the
harvard
package) is another simple option, but it requires loading a separate package (
\usepackage{harvard}
) and uses slightly different citation commands (e.g.,
\citeasnoun
,
\citeyear
). Since
natbib
is more commonly used and integrates well with
hyperref
(already in your preamble),
authordate1
is likely the better fit.
Required Changes
To implement the
authordate1
style, you need to:
Load the
natbib
package in the preamble of
unified-encodings.tex
to support author-date citations.
Replace
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
with
\bibliographystyle{authordate1}
.
Update
\cite
commands to
\citep
(for parenthetical citations like
(Jacobson, 1995)
) or
\citet
(for in-text citations like
Jacobson (1995)
), depending on your preference.
Recompile using the standard sequence:
pdflatex
,
bibtex
,
pdflatex
,
pdflatex
.
Specific Changes
Below, I provide targeted SEARCH/REPLACE instructions for
unified-encodings.tex

Compilation Instructions
To apply the changes and generate the author-date citations:
Update
unified-encodings.tex
:
Apply the SEARCH/REPLACE changes above, adding
\usepackage{natbib}
, changing
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
to
\bibliographystyle{authordate1}
, and updating
\cite
to
\citep
in the text snippet.
If other
\cite
commands exist in
unified-encodings.tex
or
appendices.tex
, replace them with
\citep
for parenthetical citations (e.g.,
\cite{Alexandrov:1995kv}
becomes
\citep{Alexandrov:1995kv}
). For in-text citations (e.g.,
Jacobson (1995) argues...
), use
\citet{Alexandrov:1995kv}
.

Run
Copy
pdflatex
unified-encodings.tex
bibtex

references.bib
to create
unified-encodings.bbl
with the
authordate1
format.
The subsequent
pdflatex
runs incorporate the
.bbl
file and resolve citations.

Wiener, N. 1948. Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
The document remains approximately 21 pages, with the bibliography on the final pages.
No text overflows margins, and previous errors (UTF-8, runaway argument) are resolved.
Additional Considerations
Updating Other Citations
:
If
appendices.tex
contains
\cite
commands, update them to
\citep
for consistency. For example:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
**SEARCH** (in `appendices.tex`, "BV/AKSZ Technical Details" section):
The Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism
\cite
{BatalinVilkovisky1981} provides a natural setting for RSVP.
**REPLACE**:
The Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism
\citep
{BatalinVilkovisky1981} provides a natural setting for RSVP.
Apply similar changes to all
\cite
commands in
appendices.tex
and other sections of
unified-encodings.tex
.
Previous Fixes
:
Ensure the previous fixes for UTF-8 errors (lines 27 and 320 in
unified-encodings.tex
, using
Alexandrov\-Kontsevich\-Schwarz\-Zaboronsky
and
Batalin\-Vilkovisky
) and the runaway argument in
appendices.tex
(correcting
\cite{Wiener1948}
) are applied, as they are critical for a clean compilation.
Hyperref Compatibility
:
The
natbib
package with
authordate1
is compatible with
hyperref
, which is already loaded. Ensure the previous fix for the hyperref warning at line 184 (
\section{\texorpdfstring{Field $\Sigma$ Dynamics}{Field Sigma Dynamics}}
) remains in place.
Alternative:
agsm
Style
:
If you prefer an even simpler author-date style, you can use the
harvard
package with
agsm
:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
**Preamble**:
\usepackage
{
harvard
}
**Bibliography Section**:
\bibliographystyle
{agsm}
\bibliography
{references}
Use
\citeasnoun{key}
for
Jacobson (1995)
and
\cite{key}
for
(Jacobson, 1995)
. However,
natbib
with
authordate1
is recommended for consistency with modern LaTeX workflows and
hyperref
.
Bibliography Formatting
:
The
authordate1
style omits some fields (e.g.,
eprint
,
doi
) for brevity compared to
apalike
. If you need these fields, consider
plainnat
with
natbib
:
latex
Collapse
Wrap
Run
Copy
\bibliographystyle
{plainnat}
This still uses author-date but includes more fields like
doi
and
eprint
.
Urdshals2025
:
The
references.bib
fix to
@misc{Urdshals2025}
should prevent BibTeX warnings. Verify that the
.bbl
file includes this entry correctly after running
bibtex
.
Expected Outcome
After applying the changes:
Citations will render as
(Author, Year)
, e.g.,
(Jacobson, 1995; Verlinde, 2011; Padmanabhan, 2010; Carney, 2022)
for the cosmology references in the provided text.
The bibliography will be sorted alphabetically by author, with a concise format, e.g.:
text
Collapse

Wiener, N. 1948. Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
The PDF will remain approximately 21 pages, with the bibliography correctly integrated and no undefined citation warnings.
The compilation log should be clean, assuming previous fixes for UTF-8 errors, runaway arguments, and hyperref warnings are applied.
If issues arise (e.g., undefined citations, formatting errors, or new warnings), please share:

it seemed like i tried authordate1 but it still used parenthesis for the dates rather than a comma
If you used the
authordate1
bibliography style from the
chicago
package with
natbib
and the citations still appear with parentheses around the year (e.g.,
(Jacobson (1995))
instead of
(Jacobson, 1995)
), this suggests a configuration issue or an unexpected behavior in the citation rendering. The
authordate1
style, when used with
natbib
, should produce citations like
(Jacobson, 1995)
when using
\citep
or
Jacobson (1995)
with
\citet
. The issue could stem from:
Incorrect loading of the
natbib
package or conflicting bibliography styles.
A mismatch between the
authordate1
style and the citation commands used.
An override by another package (e.g.,
hyperref
) or a local configuration in your LaTeX setup.
To achieve the desired author-date citation format with a comma (e.g.,
(Jacobson, 1995)
), I recommend explicitly using the
natbib
package with the
authordate1
style and ensuring the correct citation commands (
\citep
for parenthetical citations). Alternatively, if
authordate1
is not producing the expected comma-separated format, you can try the
plainnat
style, which is a reliable
natbib
-compatible style that produces
(Author, Year)
citations and is part of TeX Live 2022. Below, I provide the necessary changes to ensure citations render as
(Jacobson, 1995)
and address potential issues.
Required Changes
To ensure citations use the format
(Author, Year)
(e.g.,
(Jacobson, 1995)
), make the following changes in
unified-encodings.tex
. These changes assume you are using
natbib
and replace the previous
unsrt
style (numerical) with
plainnat
(author-date, comma-separated). I also include updates to the provided text snippet to use
\citep
for consistency.

Explanation of Changes
Loading
natbib
with Options
:
Added
\usepackage[authoryear,comma]{natbib}
to explicitly enable author-year citations with a comma separator (e.g.,
(Jacobson, 1995)
). The
comma
option ensures the year is separated by a comma rather than parentheses, addressing your concern about
authordate1
producing
(Jacobson (1995))
.
Placed before
\usepackage{hyperref}
to ensure compatibility, as
hyperref
should generally be loaded last.
Bibliography Style
:
Replaced
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
with
\bibliographystyle{plainnat}
, which is a
natbib
-compatible style that produces
(Author, Year)
citations and a bibliography sorted alphabetically by author. Unlike
authordate1
,
plainnat
includes more fields (e.g.,
doi
,
eprint
) and is known for reliable comma-separated formatting.
The
plainnat
style is part of TeX Live 2022 and works seamlessly with
natbib
.
Citation Commands
:
Changed
[1, 2, 3, 4]
to
\citep{Jacobson:1995ab,Verlinde:2010hp,Padmanabhan:2009vy,Carney2022}
, etc., to produce parenthetical citations like
(Jacobson, 1995; Verlinde, 2011; Padmanabhan, 2010; Carney, 2022)
.
Use
\citet
for in-text citations (e.g.,
Jacobson (1995) argues...
) if needed elsewhere in the document.
Why
plainnat
Instead of
authordate1
?
:
If
authordate1
produced
(Jacobson (1995))
, it may be due to a local configuration or interaction with other packages (e.g.,
hyperref
or a custom style overriding the separator). The
plainnat
style is more robust and explicitly supports comma-separated author-year citations with
natbib
's
comma
option.

Bibliography Formatting
:
The
plainnat
style includes fields like

authordate1
while maintaining a simple author-date format.
If you prefer a minimalist bibliography, you can edit
references.bib
to remove optional fields (e.g.,
doi
,
eprint
), but this is not necessary.
Urdshals2025
