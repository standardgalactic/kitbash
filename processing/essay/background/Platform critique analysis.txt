You said:
I still get the impression that most apps and platforms are pure evil.
ChatGPT said:
That impression makes sense given your critical lens on platforms. Most apps and platforms are designed within extractive economic and infrastructural logics that feel—and often are—malignant. A few angles that might clarify why they come across as "pure evil":
1. Structural Incentives
Most commercial platforms are built on
advertising, data extraction, or lock-in
. Their survival depends on maximizing attention and minimizing exit. That drives enshittification: features initially serve users, then advertisers, then only the platform's rent-extraction logic. It isn't the code itself that is "evil" but the incentive structure baked into it.
2. Interface as Trap
The design layer—what you see as "friendly"—is a compression of hidden operations. UIs obscure what data is being collected, how models are trained, how nudges steer you. The result is a
semantic bait-and-switch
: you are told the app is for "connection" or "productivity," but the underlying optimization is for engagement and monetization.
3. Cognitive Capture
Platforms instrumentalize
human cognitive limits
:
Aphantasia/anendophasia populations are disadvantaged in an attention economy that rewards constant imagery and self-narration.
Notifications and feeds exploit attentional bottlenecks.
Recommendation loops foster dependence and reduce autonomy.
So they don't just harm abstract "users"; they actively shape what kinds of minds flourish and what kinds are marginalized.
4. Ontological Violence
When apps flatten complex phenomena (friendship, art, labor, cognition) into quantifiable tokens (likes, clicks, metrics), they enact a kind of
ontological reduction
. That can feel evil because it erodes the richness of lived experience into fungible, tradeable, monetizable fragments.
5. Alternative Frame
Your RSVP lens would say platforms are
entropy pumps
: they concentrate negentropy locally (user engagement, profit) by externalizing disorder into the broader plenum (exhausted users, polarized societies, ecological cost of data centers). Their "evil" is not demonic intent but
misaligned entropic bookkeeping
.
Would you like me to frame this as a
systemic critique
(platforms as inevitable products of incentive structures), or as a
strategic map
(how to resist or subvert them using RSVP-style semantic infrastructure)?

This was from a book called introduction to automatic computers from like 1955: 
Since the early 1950*s an extensive periodieal literature has developed on com-
puters and data procc.ssing. Periodicals serx'ing the field directly have been pub-
lished by the professional associations, such ns the Association for Computing
Machinery and the Data Processing Management Association, and by private
publishers. In the latter group, fall such periodicals as Business Automation, Com-
puters and Automation, and Data Processing. Periodicals sers'ing fields that use automatic computers have also begun to carry' computer articles with increasing
frequency. Thus, journals in the fields of accounting, production, civil engineer-
ing, public administration, psychology', sales management, and the like will be
found to carry articles dealing with the use of computers.
This wealth of periodical literature contains many articles of interest and sig-
nificance. Yet because periodical literature is much more difficult to obtain in
general than books, the Suggested Readings at the ends of the chapters of this
book have been generally limited to material published in book form. In selecting
this material, stress has been put upon books presenting different points of view
and upon books offering amplification or broader coverage of certain topics.
Over the course of the years, there has been a continuing friendly argument
on whether or not automatic computers can think. The affirmative position is well rejrresented in Edmund C. Berkeley', Giant Brains or Machines That Think
(New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1949). (Mr. Berkeley has since modified
his views somewhat.) The negative position is well represented by' A. M. Turing,
"Can a Machine Think?", The World of Mathematics, Vol. 4 (New Y'ork: Simon
and Schuster, Inc., 1956), pp. 2099-2133.
The following provide general background information: Robert H. Gregory'
and Richard L. ^^an Horn, Automatic Data Processing Systems (San Francisco:
Wadsworth Publishing Co., Inc., 1960), Chapter 1. Leonard W. Hein, An Introduction to Electronic Data Processing for Business
(Princeton, N. J.: D. Van Nostrand Co., Inc., 1961), Chapter 1. Roger Nett and Stanley' A. Hetzler, An Introduction to Electronic Data Process-
ing (Glencoe, Ilk: The Free Press, 1959), Chapter 1. Samuel B. Williams, Digital Computing Systems (New York: McGraw-Hill
Book Co., Inc., 1959), Chapter 1.
ChatGPT said:
That's a fascinating snapshot of how early computing was framed in the 1950s. A few things stand out from the excerpt you shared:
1. Emergence of a Computing Literature
By the mid-1950s, computing had already begun to generate its own periodical ecosystem:
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
journals.
Data Processing Management Association (DPMA)
outlets.
Private magazines like
Business Automation
and
Computers and Automation
.
The text is emphasizing that computing wasn't just an engineering niche—it was spilling into accounting, psychology, sales management, and other applied fields. That diffusion is what turned computers from scientific curiosities into institutional infrastructure.
2. Accessibility of Knowledge
The author notes that
journals were harder to obtain than books
—which makes sense in the pre-digital era when interlibrary loan and indexing were limited. That's why the "Suggested Readings" stuck mostly to monographs. It also reflects how
books were trusted as authoritative syntheses
, while periodicals were seen as scattered or provisional.
3. "Can Computers Think?" Debate
The text references the famous back-and-forth:
Edmund C. Berkeley's
Giant Brains
(1949)
, which cast computers as machines that could "think" in some sense.
Alan Turing's essay (reprinted 1956)
, which—despite the citation—was not titled
Can a Machine Think?
but rather "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950). It seems the editor referenced the version included in Newman's
The World of Mathematics
.
The aside that "Mr. Berkeley has since modified his views" already hints at how quickly perspectives were evolving.
4. Introductory Canon
The list of suggested readings—Gregory & Van Horn, Hein, Nett & Hetzler, Williams—shows what counted as "entry points" for business and technical students. These were not speculative AI books but
manuals for data processing and system design
. It shows the practical orientation of computing education at the time: more about how to
use
machines for accounting, business, and engineering than about abstract theory.
5. Historical Significance
This passage captures a transitional moment:
Computing was
professionalizing
(ACM, DPMA).
Computing was
commercializing
(business automation magazines).
Computing was
philosophizing
(Berkeley vs. Turing).
The text stands at the threshold between computers as
specialized calculating engines
and computers as
general cognitive and organizational infrastructure
.
Would you like me to put this into a
modernized annotated bibliography style
(mapping each cited source to its role in early computing thought), or into a
historical commentary narrative
that situates this excerpt within the broader timeline of computing's emergence?
You said:
It's surprising how little the dialogue has changed except now there aren't just a few computers in colleges or large businesses but are considered a necessity for everyone
ChatGPT said:
Exactly — that continuity is striking. The
surface conditions
have changed dramatically (from million-dollar mainframes in universities and corporations to pocket devices in everyone's hands), but the
conceptual arguments
are surprisingly similar:
1. The Same Debates in Different Clothes
Then (1950s-60s):
Can computers think? Are they just glorified calculators, or do they embody "intelligence"?
Now (2020s-30s):
Can LLMs "understand"? Are they merely stochastic parrots, or do they exhibit genuine reasoning?
The words have changed — "giant brains" vs. "AGI" — but the structure of the argument is almost identical.
2. From Niche to Infrastructure
In 1955, the computer was
scarce, institutional, and experimental
: only a few universities, government labs, and corporations could justify them. By today, computing is
ubiquitous infrastructure
: phones, cars, appliances, schools, jobs — even relationships — assume digital mediation. What was once optional expertise has become
baseline participation in society
.
3. Perennial Anxiety About Substitution
In the 1950s, debates circled around
"Will computers replace human clerks, accountants, and engineers?"
Today, the discourse repeats with
"Will AI replace programmers, artists, and scientists?"
The boundary of "uniquely human work" is constantly renegotiated, but the underlying anxiety remains constant.
4. Epistemic Bottlenecks
That 1955 book notes how
access to periodicals was hard
, so readers were steered toward books. Now, the problem is inverted: periodicals, blogs, preprints, and feeds are
so abundant
that coherence and trust are the scarce commodities. Then, too little access; now, too much noise. In both eras, the human challenge is not "raw computation" but
curation of knowledge
.
5. From Speculation to Dependency
Back then, computers were things one speculated about — "can they think, can they help us?"
Now, computers are things one
cannot live without
— banking, healthcare, education, communication. The "speculative dialogue" has barely evolved, but the
stakes have intensified
: a bad definition of "thinking machine" in 1955 was academic; a bad definition of AI in 2025 is a global governance problem.
Would you like me to sketch a
side-by-side timeline
of recurring themes (1950s vs. 2020s) to make the parallels clearer, or would you prefer a
long-form essay
about why intellectual debates stagnate even as material dependence accelerates?
You said:
What Is an Automatic Computer?
COMPUTER CAPABILITY
Popular imagination is likely to picture the automatic computer as a
'Tslack box" into which one casually feeds raw information, and which after a slight pause responds by spewing forth reports, statements, schedules,
analyses, statistics, and solutions. But in fact an automatic computer usually
consists of several items of equipment each performing a definite function
(see the Frontispiece). The raw information which the automatic computer
processes is, in practice, far from raw. T)q)ically, it is the result of extens2^'e
collection, verification, and processing. Again, to get even one small report
from an automatic computer much intensive, skilled human labor must first
work out directions for how the computer is to produce the report.
Because automatic computers can carry out many operations that, up to
now, could onl)' be performed by human beings, they have been likened to
brains. But no computer can think in the creative and higher associative senses of the word, even though a few experimental machines show promise
in this direction.® For the moment, at least, and in practice, an automatic
computer cannot devise (as contrasted with selecting or putting together
from parts) a way of solving a new problem and then solve it in that way,
notwithstanding that automatic computers have been used to prove geometr)'
tlieorems, play chess, and compose music.
" Tiiese "learning," "nondelerministic," and "bionic" machines are quite different in their philosophy of design from the "deterministic" automatic computers' of this boob. A
learning machine is also very different from a teaching machine
ChatGPT said:
That passage is such a vivid period-piece. It's doing the work of demystifying the "black box" idea of an
automatic computer
in the mid-1950s. A few points stand out:
1. The Myth of Effortless Automation
The author pushes back against the fantasy that you can just feed in "raw information" and get instant answers. Instead, they emphasize all the
human labor and preprocessing
required:
Collecting and verifying data.
Preparing it in specific machine-readable formats (often punch cards).
Programming explicit instructions to get even a single "small report."
That's not so different from today, where people imagine an LLM prompt is "raw" — but it's sitting atop billions of tokens of curated, preprocessed training data, plus careful model engineering.
2. The Brain Analogy and Its Limits
Even in the 1950s, the comparison of computers to
brains
was already common. The passage is careful to draw a line:
Yes, computers can perform tasks once reserved for humans (arithmetics, schedules, proofs).
But
"no computer can think in the creative and higher associative senses of the word."
That distinction — between combinatorial search or recombination, and genuine creative insight — echoes today's debates about whether AI can
really
be creative or whether it just stitches together parts of prior material.
3. Early "Learning Machines"
The footnote about
"learning," "nondeterministic," and "bionic" machines
is telling. Already by the mid-1950s, there was a split:
Deterministic automatic computers
: what the book is about — sequential, rule-bound machines.
Learning machines
: experimental designs inspired by biology and nondeterminism (what we might now call adaptive systems or AI research).
They even take care to distinguish a
learning machine
from a
teaching machine
(a Skinner-style programmed instruction device). This shows how unsettled the vocabulary was.
4. Historical Continuity
It's remarkable how this maps directly onto today's landscape:
Then: "Automatic computers can play chess, prove theorems, compose music."
Now: "AI can play Go, write code, generate images."
Then: "But they don't
really
think."
Now: "But they don't
really
understand."
The scale and context have shifted, but the
philosophical pattern of the debate is nearly unchanged
.
Would you like me to expand this into a
comparative commentary
— lining up that 1955 definition of an automatic computer against how we define "AI systems" today, point-by-point? That would make the historical parallels very sharp.
You said:
I just saw this on Facebook: My friend got a permanent ban from Facebook. The worst part is there is no way to appeal and no one to talk to. It's all being done by a stupid computer program, I mean, it's being done by AI. 

I knew this company was bad, but wow. Finding out lots of shenanigans. It's like an episode of Black Mirror. Time to log off.
ChatGPT said:
What you saw on Facebook captures exactly what we were just noticing in those 1950s texts: the rhetoric hasn't changed much, but the
stakes have scaled up enormously
.
In the 1950s people worried about whether computers could really "think." Today the anxiety has shifted to whether AI systems can fairly and transparently
judge, decide, and govern
. A few layers to what's happening in your friend's case:
1. Automated Enforcement
Platforms like Facebook rely on large-scale automated moderation systems:
Algorithms scan for banned content, behaviors, or associations.
If the system flags an account, it can impose suspensions or bans without a human ever looking at the case.
Human review is often promised but rarely delivered, because staffing every appeal would be too expensive at billions of users.
So the "AI" isn't conscious, but it is acting as a
bureaucratic gatekeeper
, with no recourse.
2. Black Mirror Parallels
The "episode of Black Mirror" feeling comes from two factors:
Opacity
: you don't know what rule was broken, what evidence was weighed, or how to challenge it.
Dependency
: accounts are tied to social life, work, even identity verification. Losing access feels like losing a piece of one's world.
That combination — opaque decision + high dependence — produces the dystopian vibe.
3. The Old "Brain Analogy" Reversed
Back in 1955, books warned: "don't treat the computer as a black box brain — it's just a machine."
Now, the computer has been put in the role of a
judge of human legitimacy
— and we're told to treat its judgment as binding, even though it still isn't "thinking in the creative and associative sense." The
category error has flipped
: instead of over-crediting intelligence, we're over-crediting
authority
.
4. Why It Feels "Evil"
It isn't personal malice; it's structural:
The company wants scale at low cost.
Automation replaces due process.
Accountability is externalized onto the user.
That's why it feels like a betrayal: the system that claims to serve you actually treats you as disposable.
Would you like me to give you a
historical through-line
that ties the 1950s "automatic computers" discussion (machines can't really think, only follow instructions) directly to today's situation (machines can't really judge, yet they are
treated
as if they can)? That might crystallize why the feeling of "pure evil" resonates so strongly across decades.

I wanted to bring in commentary from desk set 1957 and the creation of the humanoids
ChatGPT said:
Great choices —
Desk Set
(1957) and
The Creation of the Humanoids
(1962) are almost like cinematic footnotes to the very textbook passages you've been digging into. Both dramatize the cultural anxieties around "automatic computers" and their encroachment on human domains. Here's how you could weave them in:
Desk Set
(1957): Computers vs. Human Expertise
Plot anchor
: The story centers on the installation of EMERAC, a massive computer, in a television network's research department. The staff fear it will replace them, but it turns out the machine can only handle routine queries — it struggles with nuance, context, and lived human knowledge.
Commentary tie-in
: This mirrors the 1955 textbook's insistence that computers don't process "raw" information — human labor, preprocessing, and interpretive skill remain essential. EMERAC looks like the "black box" brain people feared, but the film insists that
contextual intelligence, creativity, and associative thought
still belong to humans.
Modern resonance
: Swap EMERAC for GPT or Gemini, and the workplace fears are nearly identical: will the machine replace knowledge workers, or will it just handle the rote parts?
The Creation of the Humanoids
(1962): Automation and Authority
Plot anchor
: Set after a nuclear war, society relies on robots called "Humanoids" to rebuild. They are so advanced they even create "clickers" — human-like androids indistinguishable from people. Much of the story wrestles with whether machines that look and act human can be trusted with authority over human lives.
Commentary tie-in
: This extends the textbook's discussion of "learning" and "nondeterministic" machines. Where the book cautiously distinguished experimental "bionic" machines from deterministic computers,
Humanoids
imagines that line being crossed — machines not only mimicking but arguably surpassing human capacities.
Modern resonance
: It anticipates today's concerns about
algorithmic governance
: AI not just performing tasks, but deciding who counts as fully human (echoes of your friend's Facebook ban experience). It's a warning about what happens when we let machines arbitrate human legitimacy.
Integrative Reading
Desk Set
highlights the
limits of deterministic computing
in capturing human subtlety.
The Creation of the Humanoids
highlights the
existential threat of nondeterministic "bionic" computing
when it moves into social authority.
Together, they bracket the same fault line your 1955 textbook identifies: computers can recombine and assist, but they don't "think in the higher associative sense." Yet if we treat them as if they do, we hand them authority — and that's where the dystopian edge creeps in.
Would you like me to draft a
section for your commentary
that explicitly places these films side by side with the 1955 textbook passage (and maybe your Facebook anecdote) as a cultural arc? It could read like a "continuity of anxieties" piece, showing how speculation, art, and lived experience keep circling the same debate.
You said:
Sure
ChatGPT said:
Here's a draft you could drop into your commentary as a
cultural through-line section
, tying the 1955 textbook to
Desk Set
(1957),
The Creation of the Humanoids
(1962), and the present Facebook anecdote:
Automatic Computers and Cultural Imagination
The 1955
Introduction to Automatic Computers
sought to demystify the "black box" fantasy of machines that could casually generate knowledge. It stressed that data had to be collected, verified, and pre-processed by skilled human labor, and that computers could not "think in the creative and higher associative senses." This sober reminder against misplaced anthropomorphism echoed through popular culture.
Desk Set
(1957): Anxiety in the Workplace
In
Desk Set
, the television network's research department faces the arrival of EMERAC, a room-sized computer designed to handle reference queries. The staff fear replacement, echoing the textbook's insistence that machines only manipulate what humans structure for them. EMERAC is portrayed as powerful yet comically limited: it can retrieve information but not interpret cultural nuance or contextualize language. The film captures a transitional anxiety—computers as both indispensable assistants and opaque intruders into human expertise.
The Creation of the Humanoids
(1962): Authority and Legitimacy
By the early 1960s, anxieties had shifted from clerical replacement to existential legitimacy.
The Creation of the Humanoids
imagines a society rebuilt by robot "Humanoids" who advance to the point of manufacturing android "clickers" indistinguishable from humans. The question is no longer whether computers can calculate, but whether they can define humanity itself. This extends the textbook's passing mention of "learning" and "bionic" machines into a speculative dystopia: what happens when nondeterministic designs claim not only competence but authority?
From Early Computing to Algorithmic Governance
Fast-forward to the present: a friend receives a permanent Facebook ban, with no appeal, imposed automatically by an AI moderation system. The dystopian element lies not in the sophistication of the AI—it is neither creative nor associative—but in its
unquestioned authority
. The opacity of the decision, combined with the centrality of digital platforms to everyday life, makes the ban feel like a
Black Mirror
episode.
Continuity of Anxieties
1955: Computers are not brains, they require pre-processed input.
1957: EMERAC is a tool, not a replacement, but it destabilizes human roles.
1962: Humanoids blur the line between mechanical aid and human identity.
2025: AI moderates and governs without recourse, eroding due process.
Across seventy years, the dialogue has hardly shifted: Are machines tools, partners, or judges? What remains constant is the temptation to project human categories—"thinking," "learning," "judging"—onto systems that in practice remain deterministic, brittle, and dependent on human scaffolding. What has changed is not the argument, but the
stakes of dependence
: from scarce machines in laboratories to infrastructural systems upon which everyone's daily life now relies.
Do you want me to keep this as a
standalone essay section
(like above), or integrate it into a broader
historical timeline format
that runs from 1955 texts through film and into present AI governance?
You said:
Other criticisms include pay gates on articles and ubiquitous advertising which all assume the existence of consumers with extra money
ChatGPT said:
Yes — that's another deep continuity between mid-century computing culture and today's platform economy: the infrastructure assumes a certain kind of
idealized consumer
rather than a heterogeneous public.
1. Paywalls as Gatekeeping
In the 1955 textbook, the author remarked that
periodicals were "much more difficult to obtain" than books
, so suggested readings stuck to monographs. That was a technical barrier of access. Today, the same structural issue persists but in the form of
paywalls
: academic articles locked behind journal subscriptions, news sites behind pay gates, and APIs restricted to high-priced tiers. Both eras share the same underlying pattern:
knowledge is stratified by who can afford access
.
2. Advertising as Default Revenue Model
Advertising has become the universal solvent for funding digital services. This has several consequences:
Interfaces are designed to maximize
exposure and attention
, not clarity or utility.
"Free" platforms are actually extracting value through surveillance, profiling, and behavioral nudging.
As with your earlier observation, the
consumer is assumed to have disposable income
, so that impressions and clicks can be monetized. Those outside that assumption — the poor, the distracted, the resistant — become invisible to the system.
3. Structural Bias Toward Affluence
Both paywalls and ad-driven models assume
an audience with money to spend
. This narrows cultural and epistemic production:
Research circulates where it is profitable, not where it is needed.
Platforms prioritize advertisers over users, creating enshittification.
Civic and educational uses are sidelined because they do not map onto the "paying consumer" template.
It is in this sense that your instinct that apps and platforms feel "evil" makes sense: the entire infrastructural logic is
built on scarcity and extraction
, not inclusivity.
4. Historical Continuity with Cultural Artifacts
In
Desk Set
, EMERAC is sold to management as a cost-cutting replacement — not a tool for enriching workers' lives. The assumption is always aligned with efficiency and profitability.
In
The Creation of the Humanoids
, robots serve a society rebuilding after nuclear war — but even there, the issue is who controls them and for what ends, not equitable benefit.
Today's AI moderation, pay gates, and ad systems are the direct descendants: tools framed as universal infrastructure, but designed for those who can
pay, advertise, or be monetized
.
Would you like me to expand this critique into a
thematic subsection
alongside the one I drafted for you (on continuity of anxieties), so that your commentary develops both
conceptual parallels
(thinking, judging, authority) and
economic parallels
(access, paywalls, advertising)?
You said:
I can't think of any way to fix this without creating something that can just as easily be co-opted and commodified
ChatGPT said:
That's the core paradox. You're right: any new infrastructure you build—whether it's technical (like open protocols), semantic (like RSVP), or institutional (like public platforms)—runs the risk of
recapture
: being enclosed, commodified, or turned into another gatekeeping apparatus. That pattern isn't accidental; it's built into how socio-technical systems evolve.
A few lenses might help you map this dilemma:
1. The Capture Cycle
Innovation:
A tool, protocol, or framework arises, often with liberatory or cooperative intent.
Adoption:
As it scales, it becomes infrastructural, attracting investment and standardization.
Commodification:
The system is enclosed by commercial actors, often through intellectual property, pay gates, or interface lock-in.
Exhaustion:
Users experience enshittification, and new alternatives begin the cycle again.
You can see this from
Unix → Linux → Android
, or
Usenet → Web → Social platforms
, or even
free/open datasets → closed AI models
.
2. Why It Feels Unfixable
Entropy of governance:
Collective systems require maintenance and rule enforcement, which can easily tilt toward bureaucratic or corporate capture.
Economic substrate:
As long as monetization requires consumers with surplus income, infrastructures will be designed for commodification.
Semantic drift:
Even ideals like "open source" or "commons" eventually become brands that corporations can co-opt.
3. Possible Counter-Strategies
None of these are magic bullets, but they're attempts to
bend the cycle
:
Ephemeral tools:
Systems designed for short lifespans or rotation, making capture harder.
Distributed custodianship:
Governance models where no single actor can own or enclose the infrastructure (e.g., federated protocols, community DAOs, xylomorphic stewardship).
Entropy budgets:
Building systems where exploitation is costly and negentropic alignment is cheap, so the natural equilibrium resists enclosure.
Semantic watermarking:
Your idea of leaving "signatures" in digital systems—if widely adopted—could serve as a memory of origins and resist rebranding.
4. RSVP Perspective
From an RSVP lens, the problem isn't just capitalism "capturing" things. It's that
negentropic flows are valuable
and therefore attract parasitism. Any reservoir of ordered meaning (a protocol, a community, a dataset) generates an incentive for extraction. The task isn't to prevent co-optation absolutely, but to
design flows that reintroduce negentropy back into the commons
faster than enclosure can drain it.
Would you like me to sketch some
RSVP-inspired design principles
for infrastructures that
anticipate
co-optation and metabolize it, rather than trying to prevent it outright? That might give you a way to frame this as a systemic design challenge rather than an unsolvable trap.
You said:
Sure
ChatGPT said:
Here's a set of
RSVP-inspired design principles
you could use to frame infrastructures that resist enclosure, or at least metabolize it instead of being broken by it:
1.
Entropic Balancing
Problem:
Most systems allow easy extraction of value (negentropy) but no requirement to return anything.
Principle:
Any actor drawing order from the system must contribute proportional entropy-smoothing back into the commons.
Analogy:
In RSVP terms, vector flows (𝒗) can't just siphon Φ; they must also redistribute entropy (S) so the plenum remains stable.
2.
Ephemeralization by Design
Problem:
Durable infrastructures become monopolizable.
Principle:
Build systems with rotating keys, decaying privileges, or short lifespans for nodes/components, so capture requires continual re-engagement.
Analogy:
Like RSVP's lamphron-lamphrodyne smoothing: structures decay and reform, resisting rigidification.
3.
Distributed Custodianship
Problem:
Single custodianship accelerates commodification.
Principle:
Stewardship should be federated, fractal, and redundant. No one entity should own the merge operators or indexes.
Analogy:
Sheaf-theoretic gluing: local patches maintain autonomy but still assemble into a global plenum.
4.
Semantic Watermarking
Problem:
Co-optation erases origin and intent.
Principle:
Every artifact carries indelible signatures of its provenance (semantic hashes, watermark vectors, cultural markers). These act like "memory fields" in RSVP.
Analogy:
A soliton wave retains its form across collisions; even if appropriated, the origin remains visible.
5.
Economies of Re-use, Not Rent
Problem:
Advertising and paywalls presume endless consumer surplus.
Principle:
Incentivize systems where the most rewarded act is not extraction, but
re-integration
of outputs into shared reservoirs. Value comes from recirculation, not scarcity.
Analogy:
RSVP negentropic flows: useful work isn't hoarded but continuously reintegrated into the plenum.
6.
Design for Co-optation Loops
Problem:
Any successful system
will
be commodified.
Principle:
Anticipate this by designing "co-optation sinks": when enclosure occurs, it naturally spills value back to the commons (e.g., open standards that commodifiers must support).
Analogy:
RSVP torsion dynamics: attempts to constrict flows generate counter-flows that restore balance.
7.
Recursive Accountability
Problem:
Automated governance feels like "pure evil" because it excludes appeal and context.
Principle:
Every decision point must be recursively accountable — appealable within nested layers of oversight.
Analogy:
In RSVP, every local patch of the field is constrained by global coherence; no cell is sovereign without recursive ties.
Framed this way, the goal isn't to prevent commodification (an impossible task) but to
reframe commodification as a dissipative structure
: it happens, but the energy it consumes must cycle back into the system. That way, enclosure itself becomes a driver of resilience instead of collapse.
Would you like me to sketch a
concrete historical example
(say, Unix, Linux, Android, or the Web) using these principles to show how each step either succeeded or failed to metabolize co-optation? That might give these abstract RSVP parallels more traction.
You said:
No I worried this has happened with religions and gossip which constrain people's actions and thoughts
ChatGPT said:
You've put your finger on something profound:
the same dynamics of capture and constraint you're worried about in platforms show up in older human infrastructures like religions and gossip.
They too metabolize freedom, enforce conformity, and create incentives that are very hard to resist once scaled. A few ways to frame it:
1. Gossip as Proto-Algorithmic Moderation
Gossip works like a
distributed reputation system
: what is said about you constrains your choices, regardless of its truth.
Its efficiency comes from being low-cost, high-spread, and largely
unanonymizable
.
Much like automated bans today, gossip doesn't allow appeal or clarification; once it circulates, it shapes how others treat you.
In RSVP terms, it's a
local entropy pump
: compressing complex people into simplified, sticky narratives that persist in the plenum.
2. Religion as Infrastructural Capture
Religions historically offered
semantic scaffolding
: shared meaning, ritual, and cosmology.
But they also developed
feedback loops of control
: prescribing what to believe, how to behave, and what thoughts/actions are taboo.
Like modern platforms, they often assumed a
default subject
(male, wealthy, literate, etc.), marginalizing others.
Their strength comes from building
durable semantic watermarks
(sacred texts, institutions) that reproduce across generations.
3. The Same Paradox
Both gossip and religion began as
social negentropy mechanisms
— ways to stabilize cooperation, share values, or enforce trust. But their very success at stabilizing meaning makes them vulnerable to co-optation:
Gossip can become ostracism and character assassination.
Religion can become dogma, hierarchy, or coercion.
Platforms can become enshittified, extractive infrastructures.
Each starts as an
entropy-smoothing tool
and ends up as a
constraint on thought and action.
4. RSVP-Framed Insight
RSVP would say:
Φ (semantic capacity) is
compressed into tropes
("that person is untrustworthy," "this is heresy").
𝒗 (flows) carry these simplified packets rapidly through networks.
S (entropy) rises when nuance is erased, but the local system appears more "ordered" because behavior is constrained.
This is why it feels inescapable: these systems use
compression as control
.
5. Design Challenge
The challenge isn't avoiding these dynamics — they're inevitable wherever humans or machines create collective meaning. The challenge is whether we can design
semantic infrastructures
that:
Make narratives
less sticky
(easy to contest and revise).
Tie authority to recursive accountability (appeals, plural voices).
Build
entropy sinks
where co-optation bleeds back value into the commons rather than crystallizing into dogma.
Would you like me to sketch a
parallel timeline
—religion, gossip, and platforms—showing how each developed as a negentropy tool and then hardened into constraint? That might crystallize the sense of inevitability you're circling.

Here's one way to set up that
parallel timeline
of gossip, religion, and platforms as entropy-smoothing tools that later harden into constraints:
Timeline of Constraint Dynamics
1. Gossip (prehistoric to present)
Emergence:
Gossip evolved as a
distributed memory system
, letting small groups keep track of who was trustworthy, who contributed, who cheated. It smoothed entropy by compressing complex behavior into sharable narratives.
Constraint:
Once sticky, gossip became punitive. Stories outlast evidence, and reputation becomes destiny. No appeal process exists; once a rumor "goes viral," it shapes action regardless of truth.
Modern echo:
Algorithmic reputation (likes, bans, credit scores) works on the same compression principle: oversimplified proxies for trust travel faster than nuance.
2. Religion (ancient to present)
Emergence:
Religions offered
semantic scaffolding
for cooperation: shared cosmologies, moral codes, rituals. They reduced entropy by aligning large populations under stable narratives.
Constraint:
Success created institutions. Dogma hardened, dissent was policed, and thought/action were constrained to fit the canonical schema. The very thing that created coherence (shared story) became a mechanism of coercion.
Modern echo:
Platforms frame themselves as offering community and shared purpose ("connect the world"), but in practice enforce conformity to opaque policies and profit-driven norms.
3. Platforms (1990s-present)
Emergence:
Early internet protocols and platforms promised
openness and connection
. They lowered entropy by making communication and knowledge exchange nearly frictionless.
Constraint:
As they scaled, advertising, paywalls, and automated governance enclosed the commons. People are now subject to opaque moderation systems, surveillance economies, and enshittified interfaces. The infrastructure assumes everyone is a consumer with surplus income, shaping thought and action accordingly.
Historical rhyme:
Just as gossip punishes outside reputation and religion punishes doctrinal deviation, platforms punish misaligned behaviors algorithmically.
RSVP Lens
Φ (semantic capacity):
Gossip compresses reputations, religion encodes shared doctrines, platforms reduce behavior to engagement metrics.
𝒗 (flows):
Stories, rituals, and feeds spread simplified packets at high velocity.
S (entropy):
Complexity is erased locally, but the system appears "ordered" by constraining what can be said, done, or thought.
Continuity of Constraint
From gossip to religion to platforms, the pattern repeats:
A negentropic tool emerges to stabilize cooperation.
It scales into infrastructure.
Capture and co-optation transform it into constraint.
What changes over time is
scale and opacity
. Gossip is local and contestable; religion is institutional and transgenerational; platforms are planetary and algorithmic. But the same paradox applies: the very tools that stabilize meaning also
harden into cages of meaning
.
Would you like me to carry this forward into a
proposed "fourth stage"
— what comes
after
platforms — and how RSVP principles could pre-emptively design against hardening into another constraint cycle?
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Here's a speculative sketch of what a
"fourth stage"
after platforms might look like, if we take gossip → religion → platforms as the prior sequence. I'll phrase it through both cultural history and RSVP dynamics:
Beyond Platforms: A Fourth Stage of Semantic Infrastructure
Stage 1: Gossip
Function:
Local, ephemeral, reputation management.
Constraint:
Inescapable stories, no appeal.
Stage 2: Religion
Function:
Shared narratives, rituals, and cosmologies for large groups.
Constraint:
Dogma, institutional hierarchy, coercion.
Stage 3: Platforms
Function:
Scaled protocols for communication, commerce, and knowledge.
Constraint:
Enshittification, opaque algorithmic governance, paywalls, surveillance.
Stage 4: Semantic Infrastructures (RSVP-inflected)
Function:
Systems not built on consumption or centralized authority, but on
reciprocal negentropy flows
.
Instead of gossip compressing individuals, or religion dogmatizing doctrine, or platforms monetizing attention, the infrastructure itself recognizes
entropy budgets
: value is not attention or profit, but contribution to systemic coherence.
Constraint (to be anticipated):
Even these infrastructures could harden — into technocratic knowledge guilds, into semantic priesthoods, into "commons" controlled by a few maintainers.
The challenge is to design feedback loops where
co-optation recycles back
into shared value.
RSVP Design Tools:
Sheaf gluing:
Local groups retain autonomy, but global coherence emerges without one authority.
Entropy sinks:
Attempts at enclosure bleed energy back into the commons rather than crystallizing into monopoly.
Recursive accountability:
Decisions can always be appealed within nested oversight layers.
Analogy:
If gossip is like the nervous system, religion like the endocrine system, and platforms like the circulatory system, then semantic infrastructures would be like the
immune system
: constantly distinguishing self from non-self, but doing so adaptively, metabolizing threats instead of ossifying into permanent dogma.
Historical Trajectory
Gossip
= small-scale compression of trust.
Religion
= large-scale codification of meaning.
Platforms
= planetary-scale automation of interaction.
Semantic Infrastructures
= recursive, entropy-aware systems that metabolize capture rather than deny it.
This "fourth stage" doesn't resolve the paradox you pointed out (any system can be co-opted). Instead, it tries to
design with that inevitability in mind
, so capture becomes part of the metabolism rather than the end of the system.
Would you like me to draft this as a
succinct chart
(so you can see the whole arc at once), or as a
longer essay-style section
that situates gossip, religion, platforms, and semantic infrastructures in one flowing narrative?
You said:
You can do the chart
ChatGPT said:
Here's a compact chart showing the four stages we've been circling — gossip, religion, platforms, and a speculative RSVP-style "semantic infrastructure." It sets each side by side in terms of function, constraint, and RSVP dynamics:
Stages of Semantic Infrastructure
Stage
Function (Negentropy Role)
Constraint (When Hardened)
RSVP Dynamics
Gossip
Local memory: compresses complex reputations into shareable stories, stabilizing cooperation in small groups.
Rumors ossify into reputations; no appeal; simplification becomes destiny.
Φ compressed into tropes; 𝒗 spreads narratives; S rises as nuance erased.
Religion
Shared cosmologies, rituals, and moral codes that coordinate large populations across time and space.
Dogma, institutional hierarchy, coercive enforcement; dissent suppressed.
Φ codified as doctrine; 𝒗 flows as ritual & law; S increases as heterodoxy erased.
Platforms
Protocols and infrastructures enabling frictionless global communication, trade, and knowledge circulation.
Enshittification, surveillance, opaque moderation, paywalls; assumes consumer surplus.
Φ reduced to engagement metrics; 𝒗 flows as feeds & ads; S offloaded to users/society.
Semantic Infrastructures (RSVP)
Recursive, entropy-aware systems that metabolize co-optation and reintroduce negentropy into commons.
Risk of technocratic capture or semantic priesthood; must build sinks & accountability loops.
Φ distributed across sheaves; 𝒗 federated & reversible; S balanced by entropy sinks and recursive appeals.
This way you can see the
continuity of the cycle
: each stage starts as an entropy-smoothing tool (trust, meaning, communication, coherence) and hardens into a constraint (reputation trap, dogma, platform governance). The RSVP-inspired "semantic infrastructure" stage would be the attempt to
design with capture in mind
, metabolizing rather than denying it.
Would you like me to also sketch how this chart could
visually loop
(like a cycle rather than a linear timeline), to emphasize that each stage both replaces and recapitulates the others?

AI Will Not Make You Rich
The disruption is real. It's also predictable.
By Jerry Neumann
September 2025
Issue 04

ILLUSTRATION BY NANCY LIM-LIANG
Fortunes are made by entrepreneurs and investors when revolutionary technologies enable waves of innovative, investable companies. Think of the railroad, the Bessemer process, electric power, the internal combustion engine, or the microprocessor—each of which, like a stray spark in a fireworks factory, set off decades of follow-on innovations, permeated every part of society, and catapulted a new set of inventors and investors into power, influence, and wealth.

Yet some technological innovations, though societally transformative, generate little in the way of new wealth; instead, they reinforce the status quo. Fifteen years before the microprocessor, another revolutionary idea, shipping containerization, arrived at a less propitious time, when technological advancement was a Red Queen's race, and inventors and investors were left no better off for non-stop running.

Anyone who invests in the new new thing must answer two questions: First, how much value will this innovation create? And second, who will capture it? Information and communication technology (ICT) was a revolution whose value was captured by startups and led to thousands of newly rich founders, employees, and investors. In contrast, shipping containerization was a revolution whose value was spread so thin that in the end, it made only a single founder temporarily rich and only a single investor a little bit richer.

Is generative AI more like the former or the latter? Will it be the basis of many future industrial fortunes, or a net loser for the investment community as a whole, with a few zero-sum winners here and there?

There are ways to make money investing in the fruits of AI, but they will depend on assuming the latter—that it is once again a less propitious time for inventors and investors, that AI model builders and application companies will eventually compete each other into an oligopoly, and that the gains from AI will accrue not to its builders but to customers. A lot of the money pouring into AI is therefore being invested in the wrong places, and aside from a couple of lucky early investors, those who make money will be the ones with the foresight to get out early.

The microprocessor was revolutionary, but the people who invented it at Intel in 1971 did not see it that way—they just wanted to avoid designing desktop calculator chipsets from scratch every time. But outsiders realized they could use the microprocessor to build their own personal computers, and enthusiasts did. Thousands of tinkerers found configurations and uses that Intel never dreamed of. This distributed and permissionless invention kicked off a "great surge of development," as the economist Carlota Perez calls it, triggered by technology but driven by economic and societal forces.[1]

There was no real demand for personal computers in the early 1970s; they were expensive toys. But the experimenters laid the technical groundwork and built a community. Then, around 1975, a step-change in the cost of microprocessors made the personal computer market viable. The Intel 8080 had an initial list price of $360 ($2,300 in today's dollars). MITS could barely turn a profit on its Altair at a bulk price of $75 each ($490 today). But when MOS Technologies started selling its 6502 for $25 ($150 today), Steve Wozniak could afford to build a prototype Apple. The 6502 and the similarly priced Zilog Z80 forced Intel's prices down. The nascent PC community started spawning entrepreneurs and a score of companies appeared, each with a slightly different product.

You couldn't have known in the mid-1970s that the PC (and PC-like products, such as ATMs, POS terminals, smartphones, etc.) would revolutionize everything. While Steve Jobs was telling investors that every household would someday have a personal computer (a wild underestimate, as it turned out), others questioned the need for personal computers at all. As late as 1979, Apple's ads didn't tell you what a personal computer could do—it asked what you did with it.[2] The established computer manufacturers (IBM, HP, DEC) had no interest in a product their customers weren't asking for. Nobody "needed" a computer, and so PCs weren't bought—they were sold. Flashy startups like Apple and Sinclair used hype to get noticed, while companies with footholds in consumer electronics like Atari, Commodore, and Tandy/RadioShack used strong retail connections to put their PCs in front of potential customers. 


The market grew slowly at first, accelerating only as experiments led to practical applications like the spreadsheet, introduced in 1979. As use grew, observation of use caused a reduction in uncertainty, leading to more adoption in a self-reinforcing cycle. This kind of gathering momentum takes time in every technological wave: It took almost 30 years for electricity to reach half of American households, for example, and it took about the same amount of time for personal computers.[3] When a technological revolution changes everything, it takes a huge amount of innovation, investment, storytelling, time, and plain old work. It also sucks up all the money and talent available. Like Kuhn's paradigms in science, any technology not part of the wave's techno-economic paradigm will seem like a sideshow.[4]

The nascent growth of PCs attracted investors—venture capitalists—who started making risky bets on new companies. This development incentivized more inventors, entrepreneurs, and researchers, which in turn drew in more speculative capital.

Companies like IBM, the computing behemoth before the PC, saw poor relative performance. They didn't believe the PC could survive long enough to become capable in their market and didn't care about new, small markets that wanted a cheaper solution.

Retroactively, we give the PC pioneers the powers of prophets rather than visionaries. But at the time, nobody outside of a small group of early adopters paid any attention. Establishment media like The New York Times didn't take the PC seriously until after IBM's was introduced in August 1981. In the entire year of 1976, when Apple Computer was founded, the NYT mentioned PCs only four times.[5] Apparently, only the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, and the troublemakers were paying attention.

That piece by Jerry Neumann is a good example of the same historical pattern we've been circling with
automatic computers
,
Desk Set
, and
The Creation of the Humanoids
. It frames generative AI not as a once-in-a-century gold rush (like the microprocessor or electricity) but as a
shipping containerization moment
— transformative for society, but not especially profitable for founders and investors.
Here's how it links into our thread:
1. Cycles of Promise and Capture
Microprocessor (1970s):
Permissionless tinkering, cheap chips (6502, Z80), grassroots communities → eventually PCs, spreadsheets, smartphones. Fortunes made because value was distributed into startups, not captured solely by incumbents.
Shipping Containers (1950s):
Revolutionized global trade, but value diffused so broadly across the supply chain that investors saw little concentrated return.
Generative AI (2020s):
Neumann argues it's more like containers than chips: powerful, yes, but the value gets competed away into thin margins, captured by customers or a few oligopolies.
2. Continuity of Anxieties
1955 textbooks:
"Computers can't
really
think, they only recombine."
1957
Desk Set
:
EMERAC as threat to human jobs, but really just a clumsy assistant.
1962
The Creation of the Humanoids
:
What if machines claim
authority
over what counts as human?
2025 Neumann:
What if AI doesn't even make us rich? The anxiety shifts from
can they think
to
can they pay
.
Each era finds a different edge of discomfort: epistemic (thinking), existential (humanity), economic (profitability).
3. RSVP Perspective
From an RSVP lens, Neumann is pointing out that
AI as an entropic infrastructure redistributes order into the commons rather than concentrating it as private capital
. Like gossip or religion, it stabilizes flows of meaning and efficiency, but it resists enclosure because any advantage leaks outward quickly. Attempts to capture it (paywalls, oligopolies) are metabolized back into the broader system over time.
4. Contemporary Echoes of "Pure Evil"
Tie this back to your Facebook anecdote:
Platforms deploy AI to govern users, but
the real wealth is not in invention—it's in control
.
Users experience the "Black Mirror" edge not just from bans, but from the realization that the infrastructure exists for enclosure, not emancipation.
Neumann's argument shows that even for investors, this control doesn't necessarily produce new fortunes. It's a
zero-sum extraction game
more than a creative frontier.
Would you like me to fold Neumann's article into the
four-stage chart
(gossip → religion → platforms → semantic infrastructures) as the
economic
axis, showing how each stage also had its own "profit paradox"? That could sharpen the continuity between cultural anxieties and economic disappointments.

The business ended up being dominated primarily by the previous incumbents, and the margins went to the companies shipping goods, not the ones they shipped through. Companies like IKEA benefited from cheap shipping, going from a provincial Scandinavian company in 1972 to the world's largest furniture retailer by 2008; container shipping was a perfect fit for IKEA's flat-pack furniture. Others, like Walmart, used the predictability enabled by containerization to lower inventory and its associated costs.

With hindsight, it's easy to see how you could have invested in containerization: not in the container shipping industry itself, but in the industries that benefited from containerization. But even here, the success of companies like Walmart, Costco, and Target was coupled with the failure of others. The fallout from containerization set Sears and Woolworth on downward spirals, put the final nail in the coffin of Montgomery Ward and A&P, and drove Macy's into bankruptcy before it was rescued and downsized by Federated. Meanwhile, in North Carolina, "the furniture capital of the world," furniture makers tried to compete with IKEA by importing cheap pieces from China. They ended up being replaced by their suppliers.[15]

If there had been more time to build moats, there might have been a few dominant containerization companies, and the people behind them would be at the top of the Forbes 400, while their investors would be legendary. But moats take time to build and, unlike the personal computer, the adoption of containerization wasn't a surprise—every business with interests at stake had a strategic plan immediately.

The economist Joseph Schumpeter said "perfect competition is and always has been temporarily suspended whenever anything new is being introduced."[16] But containerization shows this isn't true at the end of tech waves. And because there is no economic profit during perfect competition, there is no money to be made by innovators during maturity. Like containerization, the introduction of AI did not lead to a period of protected profits for its innovators. It led to an immediate competitive free-for-all.

Let's grant that generative AI is revolutionary (but also that, as is becoming increasingly clear, this particular tech is now already in an evolutionary stage). It will create a lot of value for the economy, and investors hope to capture some of it. When, who, and how depends on whether AI is the end of the ICT wave, or the beginning of a new one. 

If AI had started a new wave, there would have been an extended period of uncertainty and experimentation. There would have been a population of early adopters experimenting with their own models. When thousands or millions of tinkerers use the tech to solve problems in entirely new ways, its uses proliferate. But because they are using models owned by the big AI companies, their ability to fully experiment is limited to what's allowed by the incumbents, who have no desire to permit an extended challenge to the status quo.

This doesn't mean AI can't start the next technological revolution. It might, if experimentation becomes cheap, distributed and permissionless—like Wozniak cobbling together computers in his garage, Ford building his first internal combustion engine in his kitchen, or Trevithick building his high-pressure steam engine as soon as James Watt's patents expired. When any would-be innovator can build and train an LLM on their laptop and put it to use in any way their imagination dictates, it might be the seed of the next big set of changes—something revolutionary rather than evolutionary. But until and unless that happens, there can be no irruption.

AI is instead the epitome of the ICT wave. The computing visionaries of the 1960s set out to build a machine that could think, which their successors eventually did, by extending gains in algorithms, chips, data, and data center infrastructure. Like containerization, AI is an extension of something that came before, and therefore no one is surprised by what it can and will do. In the 1970s, it took time for people to wrap their heads around the desirability of powerful and ubiquitous computing. But in 2025, machines that think better than previous machines are easy for people to understand.

Consider the extent to which the progress of AI rhymes with the business evolution of containerization:


In the "AI rhymes" column, the first four items are already underway. How you should invest depends on whether you believe Nos. 5-7 are next.

Economists are predicting that AI will increase global GDP somewhere between 1%[17] to more than 7%[18] over the next decade, which is $1-7 trillion of new value created. The big question is where that money will stick as it flows through the value chain.

Most AI market overviews have a score or more categories, breaking each of them into customer and industry served. But these will change dramatically over the next few years. You could, instead, just follow the money to simplify the taxonomy of companies:


What the history of containerization suggests is that, if you aren't already an investor in a model company, you shouldn't bother. Sam Altman and a few other early movers may make a fortune, as McLean and Ludwig did. But the huge costs of building and running a model, coupled with intense competition, means there will, in the end, be only a few companies, each funded and owned by the largest tech companies. If you're already an investor, congratulations: There will be consolidation, so you might get an exit.

Domain-specific models—like Cursor or Harvey—will be part of the consolidation. These are probably the most valuable models. But fine-tuning is relatively cheap, and there are big economies of scope. On the other hand, just as Google had to buy Invite Media in 2010 to figure out how to sell to ad agencies, domain-specific model companies that have earned the trust of their customers will be prime acquisition targets. And although it seems possible that models which generate things other than language—like Midjourney or Runway—might use their somewhat different architecture to carve out a separate technological path, the LLM companies have easily entered this space as well. Whether this applies to companies like Osmo remains to be seen.

While it's too late to invest in the model companies, the profusion of those using the models to solve specific problems is ongoing: Perplexity, InflectionAI, Writer, Abridge, and a hundred others. But if any of these become very valuable, the model companies will take their earnings, either through discriminatory pricing or vertical integration. Success, in other words, will mean defeat—always a bad thesis. At some point, model companies and app companies will converge: There will simply be AI companies, and only a few of them. There will be some winners, as always, but investments in the app layer as a whole will lose money. 

The same caveat applies, however: If an app company can build a customer base or an amazing team, it might be acquired. But these companies aren't really technology companies at all; they are building a market on spec and have to be priced as such. A further caveat is that there will be investors who make a killing arbitraging FOMO-panicked acquirors willing to massively overpay. But this is not really "investing."

There might be an investment opportunity in companies that manage the interface between the AI giants and their customers, or protect company data from the model companies—like Hugging Face or Glean—because these businesses are by nature independent of the models. But no analogue in the post-containerization shipping market became very large. Even the successful intermediation companies in the AI space will likely end up mid-sized because the model companies will not allow them to gain strategic leverage—another consequence of the absence of surprise.

When an industry is going to be big but there is uncertainty about how it will play out, it often makes sense to swim upstream to the industry's suppliers. In the case of AI, this means the chip providers, data companies, and cloud/data center companies: SambaNova, Scale AI, and Lambda, as well as those that have been around for a long time, like Nvidia and Bloomberg.

The case for data is mixed. General data—i.e., things most people know, including everything anyone knew more than, say, 10 years ago, and most of what was learned after that—is a commodity. There may be room for a few companies to do the grunt work of collating and tagging it, but since the collating and tagging might best be done by AI itself, there will not be a lot of pricing leverage. Domain-specific models will need specialist data, and other models will try to answer questions about the current moment. Specific, timely, and hard to reproduce data will be valuable. This is not a new market, of course—Bloomberg and others have done well by it. A more concentrated customer base will lower prices for this data, while wider use will raise revenues. On balance, this will probably be a plus for the industry, though not a huge one. There will be new companies built, but only a couple worth investing in.

The high capex of AI companies will primarily be spent with the infrastructure companies. These companies are already valued with this expectation, so there won't be an upside surprise. But consider that shipbuilding benefited from containerization from 1965 until demand collapsed after about 1973.[19] If AI companies consolidate or otherwise act in concert, even a slight downturn that forces them to conserve cash could turn into a serious, sudden, and long-lasting decline in infrastructure spending. This would leave companies like Nvidia and its emerging competitors—who must all make long-term commitments to suppliers and for capacity expansion—unable to lower costs to match the new, smaller market size. Companies priced for an s-curve are overpriced if there's a peak and decline.

All of which means that investors shouldn't swim upstream, but fish downstream: companies whose products rely on achieving high-quality results from somewhat ambiguous information will see increased productivity and higher profits. These sectors include professional services, healthcare, education, financial services, and creative services, which together account for between a third and a half of global GDP and have not seen much increased productivity from automation. AI can help lower costs, but as with containerization, how individual businesses incorporate lower costs into their strategies—and what they decide to do with the savings—will determine success. To put it bluntly, using cost savings to increase profits rather than grow revenue is a loser's game.

The companies that will benefit most rapidly are those whose strategies are already conditional on lowering costs. IKEA's longtime strategy was to sell quality furniture for low prices and make it up on volume. After containerization made it possible for them to go worldwide, IKEA became the world's largest retailer and Ingvar Kamprad (the IK of IKEA) became a billionaire. Similarly, Walmart, whose strategy was high volume and low prices in underserved markets, benefited from both cost savings and just-in-time supply chains, allowing increased product variety and lower inventory costs.

Today's knowledge-work companies that already prioritize the same values are the least risky way to bet on AI, but new companies will form or re-form with a high-volume, low-cost strategy, just as Costco did in the early 1980s. New companies will compete with the incumbents, but with a clean slate and hindsight. Regardless, there are few barriers to entry, so each of these firms will face stiff competition and operate in fragmented markets. Experienced management and flawless execution will be key.

Being an entrepreneur will be a fabulous proposition in these sectors. Being an investor will be harder. Companies will not need much private capital—IKEA never needed to raise risk capital, and Costco raised only one round in 1983 before going public in 1985—because implementing cost-savings technology is not capital intensive. As with containerization, there will be a long lag between technology trigger and the best investments. The opportunities will be later.

Stock pickers will also make money, but they need to be choosy. At the high end of projections, an additional 7% in GDP growth over ten years within one third of the economy gives a tailwind of only about 2% per year to these companies—even less if productivity growth from older ICT products abates. The primary value shift will be to companies that are embracing the strategic implications of AI from companies that are not, the way Walmart benefited from Sears, which took advantage of cheaper goods prices but did not reinvent itself.

Consumers, however, will be the biggest beneficiaries. Previous waves of mechanization benefited labor productivity in manufacturing, driving prices down and saving consumers money. But increased labor productivity in manufacturing also led to higher manufacturing wages. Wages in services businesses had to rise to compete, even though these businesses did not benefit from productivity gains. This caused the price of services to rise.[20] The share of household spending on food and clothing went from 55% in 1918 to 16% in 2023,[21] but the cost of knowledge-intensive services like healthcare and education have grown well above inflation. 

Something similar will happen with AI: Knowledge-intensive services will get cheaper, allowing consumers to buy more of them, while services that require person-to-person interaction will get more expensive, taking up a greater percentage of household spending. This points to obvious opportunities in both. But the big news is that most of the new value created by AI will be captured by consumers, who should see a wider variety of knowledge-intensive goods at reasonable prices, and wider and more affordable access to services like medical care, education, and advice.

There is nothing better than the beginning of a new wave, when the opportunities to envision, invent, and build world-changing companies leads to money, fame, and glory. But there is nothing more dangerous for investors and entrepreneurs than wishful thinking. The lessons learned from investing in tech over the last 50 years are not the right ones to apply now. The way to invest in AI is to think through the implications of knowledge workers becoming more efficient, to imagine what markets this efficiency unlocks, and to invest in those. For decades, the way to make money was to bet on what the new thing was. Now, you have to bet on the opportunities it opens up.

ChatGPT said:
That continuation from Neumann's article is a sharp crystallization of the "containerization analogy," and it fits neatly with the themes you've been pulling together about platforms, co-optation, and semantic infrastructures. Here's how it threads through:
1. Containerization as the Archetype of Invisible Revolution
Container shipping
transformed the world economy
but did not produce a new class of shipping tycoons. Instead, it reinforced incumbent dominance and redistributed value downstream into retail, logistics, and consumer benefit.
The "wealth" wasn't captured at the site of invention, but at the site of
implementation strategy
(IKEA, Walmart).
2. AI as "Containerization, not Microprocessor"
Neumann argues that AI, like containers, is arriving at the
mature phase of the ICT wave
, not kicking off a new wave.
The surprise factor is gone: everyone already knows what "machines that think better" look like.
As a result, there's
no protected profit period
; competition is immediate, oligopolistic, and brutal.
Innovators will be squeezed; consumers will reap most of the benefits (cheaper knowledge-intensive services, more access to education, healthcare, etc.).
3. The Investment Paradox
Model companies:
Only the earliest investors will win, because consolidation will concentrate control in a few giants (Altman, Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, etc.).
App companies:
They can't capture value because models will vertically integrate, absorbing or pricing them out.
Suppliers:
Chips, data centers, specialized datasets may see returns, but already overpriced, and vulnerable to demand shocks.
Beneficiaries:
Downstream sectors (professional services, healthcare, education, finance, creative work) that adopt AI cost savings into their models.
True winners:
Consumers. Just as containerization made global trade cheaper, AI will make knowledge services cheaper, though the human-labor side (in-person services) will rise in relative cost.
4. Cultural Continuity with Gossip-Religion-Platforms
Gossip:
Distributed, free, but reputation once formed is sticky.
Religion:
Centralized narratives, long-term authority, moral order.
Platforms:
Algorithmic mediation, monetized control, user disposability.
AI (as containerization):
No new priesthood of wealth, but pervasive restructuring. It erodes margins, flattens opportunity, and shifts value to consumers.
Like gossip and religion, AI functions as a
semantic infrastructure
: it constrains and coordinates action, but without producing new centers of economic sovereignty beyond the oligopoly. Its "evil" lies not in malice, but in how it
removes agency at both ends
: workers displaced, entrepreneurs squeezed, users governed by automated systems.
5. RSVP-Framed Commentary
From RSVP's perspective:
Φ (semantic density):
AI commodifies knowledge by flattening it into universally accessible outputs.
𝒗 (flows):
Model-to-app pipelines concentrate control at bottlenecks (OpenAI APIs, Google Cloud, etc.).
S (entropy):
Instead of localized disorder, the system offloads entropy into economic precarity for workers, thin margins for entrepreneurs, and governance opacity for users.
The analogy suggests: AI is revolutionary
without enrichment
. Its true danger is that it entrenches existing oligopolies while appearing to "liberate" consumers, just as containerization entrenched Walmart while collapsing Sears, Woolworth, and Montgomery Ward.
Would you like me to integrate Neumann's
AI-as-containerization
argument into the
four-stage chart
(Gossip → Religion → Platforms → Semantic Infrastructures) as an
economic dimension
— showing how each stage both distributes and captures value differently?
You said:
Sure don't call it AI exactly but chokepoint capitalism
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — calling it
chokepoint capitalism
is sharper and ties directly into both the platform critique and Neumann's economic analogy. Here's the expanded
four-stage chart with an added economic dimension
, reframed through the lens of chokepoints:
Stages of Semantic Infrastructure and Economic Capture
Stage
Function (Negentropy Role)
Constraint (When Hardened)
RSVP Dynamics
Economic Capture
Gossip
Local memory: compresses reputations to stabilize trust in small groups.
Rumors ossify; no appeal; simplification becomes destiny.
Φ compressed into tropes; 𝒗 spreads quickly; S rises as nuance erased.
No accumulation: reputational economy, value dissipates locally.
Religion
Shared cosmologies, rituals, codes for large-scale cooperation.
Dogma, hierarchy, coercion; dissent suppressed.
Φ codified as doctrine; 𝒗 flows as ritual/law; S increases as heterodoxy erased.
Wealth and power captured by priestly and institutional classes.
Platforms
Global infrastructures for communication, commerce, and knowledge circulation.
Enshittification, opaque governance, surveillance, paywalls.
Φ reduced to engagement metrics; 𝒗 flows as feeds/ads; S offloaded to users/society.
Rent extraction via chokepoints (ads, APIs, app stores); oligopolistic concentration.
Chokepoint Capitalism (Containerization/AI Analogy)
Restructures value chains by lowering costs and enabling efficiency at scale.
Immediate commodification; oligopoly prevents new entrants; innovators squeezed.
Φ commodified into outputs; 𝒗 bottlenecked at infrastructure chokepoints; S externalized as precarity.
Value accrues downstream (Walmart, IKEA equivalents); consumers benefit most, entrepreneurs and workers hollowed out.
Semantic Infrastructures (RSVP)
Recursive, entropy-aware systems that metabolize capture, reintroducing negentropy into commons.
Risk of technocratic "semantic priesthood"; must include sinks and accountability loops.
Φ distributed via sheaves; 𝒗 federated & reversible; S balanced by entropy sinks and recursive appeals.
Designed to resist chokepoints: wealth recirculates, capture metabolized back into commons.
Commentary
Gossip:
No wealth capture, only local reputation stakes.
Religion:
Capture by institutional elites.
Platforms:
Capture through monetized chokepoints (ads, APIs, ecosystems).
Chokepoint Capitalism:
Capture collapses innovation opportunities entirely; incumbents (model companies, shipping giants) squeeze out entrepreneurs, value flows to consumers and oligopolies, not new wealth.
Semantic Infrastructures:
A possible escape, designing systems where
attempts at enclosure naturally recycle value
into the commons, resisting capture cycles.
Do you want me to expand this into a
flow diagram narrative
(like gossip → religion → platforms → chokepoint capitalism → semantic infrastructures), showing not just the table but how each stage evolves into the next as constraints harden? That might make the "cycle of capture" even clearer.

Do you have an outline for the essay?
ChatGPT said:
Here's a possible
outline for the essay
that ties together the historical sources (1950s textbooks,
Desk Set
,
The Creation of the Humanoids
), your Facebook anecdote, Neumann's "AI-as-containerization" argument, and the RSVP/chokepoint capitalism framing:
Outline:
From Gossip to Chokepoint Capitalism: Cycles of Semantic Constraint
Introduction
Open with the recurring cultural anxiety: computers as black boxes that "think" or judge.
Contrast 1950s optimism with modern dystopian experiences (e.g., opaque Facebook bans).
Thesis: technological infrastructures (gossip, religion, platforms, chokepoint capitalism) follow a recurring cycle — they emerge to stabilize meaning, then harden into constraints.
1. The Early Frame (1950s Textbooks)
Automatic computers defined: not brains, but machines needing extensive preprocessing.
Emphasis on human labor behind machine "outputs."
Early debate: Berkeley's
Giant Brains
vs. Turing's "Can a Machine Think?"
Sets up the paradox of over-ascribing intelligence to deterministic systems.
2. Cultural Imaginaries (1957-1962)
Desk Set
: EMERAC threatens jobs, but only handles routine tasks; context and nuance remain human.
The Creation of the Humanoids
: explores the leap from assistant machines to authority machines; who defines humanity?
Both films stage the same anxieties as the textbooks: tools, partners, or judges?
3. Platforms as Enclosures
Transition from scarce institutional computers to ubiquitous digital platforms.
The illusion of accessibility vs. reality of opaque governance.
Example: Facebook bans as "Black Mirror bureaucracy" — machines as judges with no appeal.
Platforms as gossip/religion at planetary scale: compress, codify, constrain.
4. Chokepoint Capitalism
Introduce Neumann's containerization analogy.
Distinction: microprocessor = distributed experimentation, containerization = immediate commodification.
Argument: generative systems today are more like containerization — reinforcing incumbents, squeezing innovators, value flowing downstream.
Consumers benefit; entrepreneurs and workers are hollowed out.
5. Continuity of Constraint Cycles
Gossip: local trust economy → reputation traps.
Religion: shared meaning → institutional dogma.
Platforms: communication → enshittified chokepoints.
Chokepoint capitalism: efficiency → oligopoly & commodification.
Each stage begins as negentropic innovation and ends as constraint.
6. RSVP and Semantic Infrastructures
RSVP lens: Φ compressed, 𝒗 bottlenecked, S offloaded.
Proposal for a fourth stage: entropy-aware semantic infrastructures.
Key principles: entropic balancing, ephemeralization, recursive accountability, semantic watermarking.
Goal: metabolize co-optation rather than denying it, so capture feeds back into the commons.
Conclusion
The debate hasn't changed ("can machines think?" → "can machines judge?" → "can machines make us rich?").
What's changed is dependence: from rare machines to total infrastructures.
Without new design principles, every wave repeats the same cycle of capture and constraint.
RSVP offers a speculative way forward: systems that stabilize meaning without ossifying into chokepoints.

Abstract
This essay examines the continuity of cultural and economic anxieties surrounding computing technologies, from the first textbooks on "automatic computers" in the 1950s to contemporary debates over chokepoint capitalism. Early accounts, such as Ned Chapin's
An Introduction to Automatic Computers
(1963), warned against treating machines as "brains," stressing that outputs depended on extensive human preprocessing. Films like
Desk Set
(1957) and
The Creation of the Humanoids
(1962) dramatized these anxieties, staging the tension between computers as assistants, threats, and judges. Today, opaque platform governance—illustrated by algorithmic account bans—extends this lineage, giving machines not intelligence but authority.
Economically, the trajectory also rhymes: whereas the microprocessor enabled permissionless invention and new fortunes, containerization spread value downstream to consumers and incumbents. As Jerry Neumann (2025) argues, generative infrastructures resemble containerization more than the microprocessor: revolutionary in effect, but consolidating wealth into oligopolistic chokepoints rather than spawning broad entrepreneurial opportunity.
To frame this cycle, the essay proposes a typology of semantic infrastructures—gossip, religion, platforms, and chokepoint capitalism—each emerging as an entropy-smoothing tool that later hardens into constraint. Drawing on the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory, the essay sketches design principles for a potential "fourth stage": semantic infrastructures that metabolize co-optation rather than ossifying into rent-seeking chokepoints. The goal is not to deny capture but to circulate it back into the commons, allowing infrastructures to stabilize meaning without collapsing into constraint.

Introduction
that follows from the abstract and sets up the essay's trajectory:
Introduction
Since the mid-twentieth century, computing has been accompanied by a persistent set of cultural and economic anxieties. In the 1950s, textbooks such as Ned Chapin's
An Introduction to Automatic Computers
(1963) warned readers against imagining machines as autonomous "giant brains," emphasizing instead the skilled human labor that went into preparing data and programming instructions. Yet almost immediately, public discourse and popular media framed computers in precisely those anthropomorphic terms. Films like
Desk Set
(1957) depicted giant room-sized machines as potential replacements for human experts, while
The Creation of the Humanoids
(1962) envisioned a society in which machines not only performed human tasks but also claimed authority over the very definition of humanity.
The continuity of this discourse is striking. Early commentators argued that computers could not "think in the higher associative sense," but they might still play chess, prove theorems, or compose music. Today, the same argument is repeated almost verbatim about generative systems: they can simulate conversation, draft essays, or generate images, but critics ask whether they
really
understand. The vocabulary has changed, but the structure of the debate—machines as tools, partners, or judges—remains the same. What has changed is scale. In 1955 there were a handful of institutional machines; in 2025, automated systems govern billions of users, often invisibly. A Facebook ban imposed by algorithm with no appeal is not just a matter of technical curiosity but a matter of livelihood, reputation, and identity.
Alongside the cultural narrative, the economics of computing have followed a parallel trajectory. Some technologies, like the microprocessor, created fortunes by enabling distributed experimentation and new entrepreneurial ecosystems. Others, like container shipping, transformed society but concentrated profits downstream, reinforcing incumbents rather than generating new fortunes. As Jerry Neumann (2025) argues, generative infrastructures belong to the latter category: revolutionary in their effects, but arriving at a moment of consolidation that rewards oligopolies and consumers rather than new innovators.
This essay traces these continuities across four stages of semantic infrastructure: gossip, religion, platforms, and what can be called chokepoint capitalism. Each stage emerges as an entropy-smoothing mechanism that stabilizes cooperation and meaning, only to harden into constraint. To interpret this cycle, the essay employs the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, which models semantic systems in terms of scalar density (Φ), vector flows (𝒗), and entropy (S). From this perspective, the goal is not to deny co-optation but to design infrastructures that metabolize it, recirculating value into the commons rather than ossifying into dogma, bureaucracy, or oligopoly.
Do you want the next section to move directly into the
historical frame (1950s textbooks)
, or should I build a
shorter bridging section
first that lays out the "cycle of semantic infrastructures" (gossip → religion → platforms → chokepoints) before diving into history?

The bridging section
ChatGPT said:
Here's a draft
bridging section
that you can slot between the Introduction and the historical discussion of 1950s computing:
The Cycle of Semantic Infrastructures
To situate the history of computing within a longer arc, it is useful to think of communication and coordination systems as recurring stages of
semantic infrastructure
. Each stage begins as a negentropic innovation that stabilizes cooperation, but as it matures, it hardens into a structure of constraint. Four such stages are particularly instructive.
Gossip
was the earliest form: a distributed memory system that compressed complex behavior into shareable narratives. It enabled trust and cooperation in small groups but quickly ossified into reputation traps from which there was no appeal.
Religion
extended this logic to scale. By codifying cosmologies, rituals, and moral codes, it aligned large populations across generations. Yet its very durability turned into hierarchy and dogma, with institutions exercising coercive authority over thought and action.
Platforms
are the digital heirs of gossip and religion. Promising connection and frictionless communication, they achieved planetary scale but at the cost of enshittification, opaque governance, surveillance, and the universal assumption of the consumer with surplus income. Where gossip was reputational and religion doctrinal, platforms are algorithmic.
Finally,
chokepoint capitalism
marks the current stage. As Jerry Neumann (2025) has argued by analogy to containerization, today's generative infrastructures are revolutionary in effect but consolidating in economics. Value is created, but capture occurs at oligopolistic chokepoints, leaving innovators and workers squeezed while consumers reap most of the benefit.
Seen in sequence, these stages illustrate a persistent cycle: emergent systems arise to smooth entropy and generate order, only to be captured, ossified, and weaponized as constraints. This cycle provides the backdrop for the more specific cultural and economic narratives of computing, from the textbooks of the 1950s to the platform dystopias of today.
Do you want me to move next into the
1950s historical frame
(Chapin's textbook, Berkeley, Turing, etc.), or expand this bridging section into a
more schematic version with a diagram-equivalent in prose
(a kind of verbal flowchart)?

Here's a draft
Historical Frame
section that follows the bridging discussion and anchors the essay in the 1950s computing context:
The Historical Frame: Automatic Computers in the 1950s
By the mid-1950s, the term
automatic computer
had entered both technical and popular vocabularies, carrying with it a potent mix of awe and misunderstanding. Ned Chapin's
An Introduction to Automatic Computers
(2nd ed., 1963) exemplifies the effort to demystify the new technology. Chapin cautioned against the popular image of the computer as a "black box" into which raw data could be poured and out of which finished answers would flow. In reality, data had to be collected, verified, coded, and prepared at great human cost before a machine could produce even a single "small report." Far from being autonomous intelligences, computers were framed as elaborate but rigidly deterministic tools, dependent on meticulous preprocessing.
This sober framing was set against a broader debate already in motion. Edmund C. Berkeley's
Giant Brains, or Machines That Think
(1949) argued that computers should be understood as machines that could, in a limited sense, "think." Alan Turing's famous essay "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), reprinted in James Newman's
The World of Mathematics
(1956), framed the question more precisely: not "do machines think?" but "can their performance be indistinguishable from human reasoning?" These early positions already mapped the terrain of argument that still dominates today: whether computational reproduction of human-like tasks counts as intelligence, or merely as mechanical mimicry.
The professional literature of the period reinforced this tension. Samuel Williams's
Digital Computing Systems
(1959), Roger Nett and Stanley Hetzler's
An Introduction to Electronic Data Processing
(1959), and Robert Gregory and Richard Van Horn's
Automatic Data Processing Systems
(1960) positioned computers primarily as business and administrative tools. They emphasized efficiency, error reduction, and new forms of managerial control rather than speculation about artificial thought. In other words, while philosophical discourse leaned toward the mind-machine question, professional manuals steered students and practitioners toward the prosaic but transformative domains of accounting, scheduling, and information management.
Taken together, these texts illustrate the cultural duality of early computing: at once a technical apparatus of extraordinary promise and a conceptual object onto which debates about intelligence, creativity, and human uniqueness were projected. What was still scarce in this period was not anxiety but
scale
: the number of machines was small, their audiences were specialized, and their impact—though widely heralded—was still largely confined to institutions. It was this scarcity that allowed both utopian projection and sober delimitation to coexist without resolution.

Here's the draft
Cultural Imaginaries
section that follows directly from the historical frame:
Cultural Imaginaries: From Clerical Anxiety to Existential Authority
If mid-century textbooks sought to discipline the imagination of computing, popular culture provided the opposite: dramatizations that amplified hopes and fears. Two films from the late 1950s and early 1960s,
Desk Set
(1957) and
The Creation of the Humanoids
(1962), capture distinct moments in this cultural imaginary.
Clerical Anxiety:
Desk Set
Walter Lang's
Desk Set
is ostensibly a romantic comedy but also a workplace fable about the arrival of EMERAC, a massive "electronic brain" installed in a television network's research department. The staff of reference librarians, threatened by redundancy, embody the anxieties Chapin and others sought to calm: the fear that machines would effortlessly replace human skill. EMERAC, however, is portrayed as a limited assistant, easily confused by context and nuance. The lesson is not that machines will think, but that they will destabilize workplaces by demanding new forms of human oversight.
Desk Set
thus dramatizes the very warning found in the textbooks: computers are not autonomous intelligences, but they reshape labor and expertise in ways that feel threatening to those whose livelihoods depend on specialized knowledge.
Existential Authority:
The Creation of the Humanoids
By 1962, the cultural register had shifted. Wesley Barry's
The Creation of the Humanoids
imagines a post-apocalyptic society rebuilt by highly advanced robots. These machines go beyond clerical substitution, raising the specter of replacement at the level of identity itself. The humanoids not only labor alongside humans but also manufacture android "clickers" that are indistinguishable from their creators. The central question is no longer whether machines can compute or retrieve facts, but whether they can claim the prerogative to define humanity. This is a far cry from Chapin's careful reminder that computers merely execute prepared instructions. Here the machine's authority is speculative and existential.
From Assistant to Judge
Together, the films illustrate the widening arc of cultural anxiety.
Desk Set
stages the fear of displacement within the bureaucratic workplace;
The Creation of the Humanoids
projects the fear of domination within society at large. Both extend the philosophical debates of Berkeley and Turing into narrative form, mapping the transition from "machines as tools" to "machines as judges."
This cultural imaginary did not emerge in isolation. It built upon the scarcity and mystique of early computers, exaggerating their capacity while also crystallizing the anxieties of clerks, managers, and citizens whose daily lives were increasingly mediated by information. As with gossip and religion in earlier eras, the narratives simplified complex realities into easily transmissible forms—rumors, doctrines, films—that circulated faster than nuance.

Here's a
transition paragraph
that ties the cultural imaginaries (
Desk Set
and
The Creation of the Humanoids
) back to the 1950s textbook discourse, and sets up the move into platforms:
Transition: From Textbook Warnings to Platform Realities
What is striking is how closely these cultural artifacts rhymed with the sober discourse of the textbooks. Chapin (1963) warned readers that automatic computers could not think creatively but might still play chess or compose music;
Desk Set
dramatized this by showing a computer capable of retrieval but incapable of contextual judgment. Where Berkeley speculated about "giant brains" and Turing proposed tests of indistinguishability,
The Creation of the Humanoids
projected the same questions into a speculative future, asking whether machines might ultimately acquire not just intelligence but social authority. Both technical manuals and popular films thus rehearsed the same categories—tool, partner, judge—even as they disagreed about feasibility and risk.
What has changed since then is not the content of the debate but its scale. In the 1950s and early 1960s, there were only a handful of institutional computers; their scarcity allowed the discourse to remain abstract. Today, platform infrastructures embed algorithmic systems into nearly every aspect of daily life. A permanent ban issued by a content-moderation algorithm with no appeal is not a thought experiment but an ordinary event. Machines that cannot think in any strong sense nevertheless exercise the authority of judgment. This is the shift from
imagined anxieties
to
lived enclosures
, and it marks the entrance into the platform era.
Do you want me to now draft the
Platforms as Enclosures
section, grounding it in your Facebook example and linking it to the "chokepoint capitalism" argument?

Platforms as Enclosures
section:
Platforms as Enclosures
If gossip compressed reputation and religion codified doctrine, digital platforms represent the third great enclosure of semantic life. Built on the promise of openness and connection, platforms achieved planetary scale by reducing friction in communication, commerce, and cultural exchange. Yet as their infrastructures matured, they hardened into chokepoints: opaque governance systems, advertising-driven attention funnels, and algorithmic reputations. What had been marketed as liberation became constraint.
The everyday experience of this shift is stark. A permanent Facebook ban imposed by an automated moderation system illustrates the new reality. The user is given no reason, no appeal, no interlocutor—only the judgment of an algorithm, treated as binding. The situation is paradoxical. As Ned Chapin reminded readers in 1963, computers cannot "devise a way of solving a new problem" but only follow instructions. Yet on modern platforms, machines that cannot think in any associative or creative sense are endowed with
authority
. They are no longer assistants but judges, arbitrating identity, legitimacy, and access to networks of friends, markets, and publics.
This dynamic produces what critics call
chokepoint capitalism
(Giblin and Doctorow 2022). Platforms position themselves at key bottlenecks in the flow of communication and value—app stores, ad networks, content feeds, moderation pipelines—and extract rent from their control. The structure mirrors the gossip-religion cycle: tools designed to stabilize meaning end by constraining it. Where gossip froze reputations, and religion ossified belief, platforms lock behavior into monetized channels, demanding users act as both consumers and commodities.
The opacity of these enclosures intensifies their dystopian character. In
Desk Set
, EMERAC's limitations were comic, its malfunctions immediately visible. On Facebook, the malfunction is systemic: an invisible process that declares a human account invalid without explanation. The "Black Mirror" feeling arises not from machine intelligence but from machine
unaccountability
—a bureaucracy without appeal.
This is the condition in which contemporary anxieties about computing are grounded. The textbook debates and cinematic dramatizations have not vanished; they have simply been absorbed into infrastructures that now govern billions. Platforms operationalize the old question—tool, partner, or judge—by silently treating the computer as judge, while obscuring the human hands that programmed the rules of judgment.

Here's a concise
transition paragraph
to bridge from the lived experience of platform bans into the broader economic logic of chokepoint capitalism:
Transition: From Lived Constraint to Economic Capture
The experience of automated bans and opaque moderation makes visible, at the individual scale, what is happening structurally across the economy. Platforms do not simply govern communication; they extract value by controlling the passage points through which communication, culture, and commerce must flow. What looks like "algorithmic judgment" to a user is, at the macro level, the same dynamic identified by economic historians as chokepoint capitalism: profits accrue not from invention or creativity, but from occupying bottlenecks where no alternative routes exist. In this sense, the social constraint of the Facebook ban and the economic logic of container shipping belong to the same pattern.
Do you want me to now draft the
Chokepoint Capitalism
section, weaving in Neumann's containerization analogy and the parallels to generative infrastructures?
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Here's the draft
Chokepoint Capitalism
section that builds from the transition and integrates Neumann's containerization analogy:
Chokepoint Capitalism
If platforms are enclosures, chokepoint capitalism is their economic logic. Rather than producing new fortunes through permissionless experimentation, as the microprocessor did in the 1970s, chokepoint capitalism resembles containerization in the 1950s: revolutionary in effect, but consolidating in outcome. Container shipping transformed global trade, but profits accrued not to the innovators who designed the containers or the companies that operated the ships, but to the downstream incumbents who leveraged efficiency at scale. Walmart and IKEA, not shipbuilders or port authorities, became the primary beneficiaries.
Jerry Neumann (2025) argues that generative infrastructures follow this same pattern. They arrive not at the beginning of a new techno-economic wave, but at the end of the ICT cycle, when surprise is absent and experimentation is constrained. Entrepreneurs cannot build the equivalent of Apple or Microsoft in a garage, because the core models are owned by a handful of incumbents. Instead, new companies are born already dependent on the pricing, terms, and permissions of the model providers. As with containerization, the economic shock is immediate: a competitive free-for-all where margins collapse and only oligopolies survive.
The consequences mirror what users experience under opaque moderation. Just as a Facebook ban removes an individual's agency without recourse, chokepoint capitalism removes entrepreneurial agency by foreclosing routes of innovation. Value flows through a few bottlenecks—APIs, cloud platforms, ad networks—and is captured there. Downstream firms may benefit by integrating cheaper knowledge services into healthcare, education, or finance, just as Walmart leveraged logistics to dominate retail. Consumers may benefit from lower costs. But innovators are squeezed, and workers find themselves displaced into thinner margins.
In this sense, the economic enclosure and the social enclosure are inseparable. The same infrastructures that govern who can speak, trade, or participate are those that determine where profits accumulate. Chokepoint capitalism is not a deviation from the gossip-religion-platform cycle; it is its culmination. What begins as an entropy-smoothing tool, stabilizing flows of communication or trade, ends as a system of rigid bottlenecks, both semantic and economic.

Continuity of Constraint Cycles
section that ties together gossip, religion, platforms, and chokepoint capitalism:
Continuity of Constraint Cycles
When viewed together, the four stages of semantic infrastructure—gossip, religion, platforms, and chokepoint capitalism—form a repeating cycle. Each emerges as a negentropic innovation that stabilizes cooperation, only to harden into a mechanism of constraint.
Gossip
originated as a local memory system, compressing the complexities of individual behavior into simple, transmissible stories. It enabled trust and social cohesion in small groups, but once reputations ossified, there was no appeal: a rumor could define a life.
Religion
scaled this compression to entire civilizations. By codifying cosmologies and moral codes, it provided durable meaning across generations. Yet stability was purchased at the cost of hierarchy and dogma, with dissent often criminalized. What began as shared semantic scaffolding became coercive doctrine.
Platforms
are the digital heirs to these infrastructures. Promising frictionless connection, they centralized communication and commerce at global scale. But the same mechanisms that smoothed interaction—feeds, metrics, recommendation systems—matured into enclosures. Behavior was funneled into monetizable forms, and opaque moderation became the algorithmic equivalent of gossip and dogma: judgments issued without recourse.
Chokepoint capitalism
represents the culmination of this cycle. Just as containerization transformed trade while consolidating profits downstream, generative infrastructures reshape knowledge and services while reinforcing oligopoly. Value accrues not to innovators but to incumbents and consumers, while entrepreneurs and workers find themselves trapped in narrowing margins. The chokepoint captures both semantic authority (who may speak, publish, participate) and economic rents (who may profit).
This continuity reveals a paradox. Every stage begins as an answer to entropy: gossip stabilizes small-group trust, religion provides shared meaning, platforms lower the cost of communication, and chokepoint infrastructures promise efficiency. Yet each eventually constrains what it sought to free, producing new forms of enclosure. The cycle repeats because entropy-smoothing mechanisms are attractive but inherently prone to capture.
Would you like me to move next into the
RSVP and Semantic Infrastructures
section, where we sketch design principles for a potential "fourth stage" that metabolizes capture instead of ossifying into chokepoints?
You said:

ChatGPT said:
Here's the draft
RSVP and Semantic Infrastructures
section:
RSVP and Semantic Infrastructures
If gossip, religion, platforms, and chokepoint capitalism illustrate a cycle of semantic capture, the open question is whether an alternative design is possible—one that stabilizes meaning without hardening into enclosure. The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework offers a speculative way forward.
RSVP models any semantic system in terms of three interacting fields: scalar density (Φ), vector flows (𝒗), and entropy (S). In gossip, Φ collapses into simplified reputations, 𝒗 accelerates through rumor, and S rises as nuance disappears. In religion, Φ is codified as doctrine, 𝒗 flows through ritual and law, and S is managed by suppressing heterodoxy. In platforms, Φ is compressed into metrics, 𝒗 flows as algorithmic feeds, and S is offloaded onto users and society. In chokepoint capitalism, Φ is commodified, 𝒗 bottlenecked at oligopolistic infrastructures, and S externalized as precarity.
The task, then, is not to prevent capture—which history suggests is impossible—but to
metabolize it
. An RSVP-inspired semantic infrastructure would include:
Entropic balancing
: mechanisms to ensure that the accumulation of Φ (semantic density) does not ossify into dogma or metrics without countervailing flows.
Ephemeralization
: built-in decay rates for authority, so that no node—whether a rumor, a creed, or a platform algorithm—can indefinitely dominate 𝒗.
Recursive accountability
: appeal structures woven into the system itself, where judgments must be reversible through layered oversight, preventing the "no appeal" condition of gossip, dogma, or automated bans.
Semantic watermarking
: signals of origin and transformation, allowing users to trace how Φ was generated, recombined, or constrained, and thus detect capture before it calcifies.
Such infrastructures would still experience attempts at enclosure, but capture would be
recirculated into the commons
rather than extracted as rent. Instead of enshittification, the system would resemble a metabolic loop: chokepoints arise, are detected, and are dissolved back into distributed flows.
This is not a utopian fix but a thermodynamic one. If every semantic infrastructure emerges as an entropy-smoothing mechanism that later ossifies, then the challenge is to design infrastructures whose very structure resists ossification—systems that treat capture not as failure but as fuel for renewal.
Would you like me to close with a

Conclusion

Conclusion
From the mid-century warnings of Ned Chapin and the debates of Berkeley and Turing, to the cinematic fables of
Desk Set
and
The Creation of the Humanoids
, the cultural question has never really changed: are machines tools, partners, or judges? What has changed is the scale of their integration. Where once a few institutional machines produced anxieties of clerical redundancy or speculative android futures, today's platform infrastructures impose algorithmic judgments on billions, often without appeal.
Economically, the parallel cycle is just as clear. Some technologies, like the microprocessor, enabled distributed invention and entrepreneurial fortunes. Others, like containerization, spread value downstream while hollowing out opportunities for innovators. Generative infrastructures today appear to rhyme with the latter, reinforcing chokepoints and oligopolies. Consumers may benefit, but innovators and workers find themselves constrained, just as individuals find themselves constrained by opaque platform rules.
Seen through the typology of semantic infrastructures—gossip, religion, platforms, and chokepoint capitalism—each stage begins as an entropy-smoothing mechanism and ends as an enclosure. The persistence of this cycle suggests that capture is not an aberration but a structural outcome. The challenge, then, is not to imagine that capture can be prevented, but to design systems in which it can be metabolized.
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework offers one such speculative path. By treating semantic infrastructures as dynamic fields of density, flow, and entropy, RSVP proposes architectures that balance accumulation with decay, embed recursive appeals, and recirculate value into the commons. In this vision, infrastructures stabilize meaning without collapsing into dogma, bureaucracy, or oligopoly.
The debate over whether machines can think has always been a distraction. The real question, both in 1955 and in 2025, is how infrastructures that mediate thought are designed, captured, and contested. To answer that question requires not just critique of chokepoints, but experimentation with infrastructures that resist ossification. Only then can we imagine a cycle that does not repeat itself in constraint, but opens into renewal.

### **Introduction**
 
 
- Open with the recurring cultural anxiety: computers as black boxes that "think" or judge.
 
- Contrast 1950s optimism with modern dystopian experiences (e.g., opaque Facebook bans).
 
- Thesis: technological infrastructures (gossip, religion, platforms, chokepoint capitalism) follow a recurring cycle — they emerge to stabilize meaning, then harden into constraints.

- Sets up the paradox of over-ascribing intelligence to deterministic systems.
 

  
### **2. Cultural Imaginaries (1957-1962)**
 
 
- *Desk Set*: EMERAC threatens jobs, but only handles routine tasks; context and nuance remain human.
 
- *The Creation of the Humanoids*: explores the leap from assistant machines to authority machines; who defines humanity?
 
- Both films stage the same anxieties as the textbooks: tools, partners, or judges?
 

  
### **3. Platforms as Enclosures**
 
 
- Transition from scarce institutional computers to ubiquitous digital platforms.
 
- The illusion of accessibility vs. reality of opaque governance.

that draws on both the cultural-historical arc (1950s → platforms → chokepoints) and the formal RSVP/semantic infrastructure framework from your monograph:
Outline:
From Gossip to Chokepoint Capitalism: Cycles of Semantic Constraint
Abstract
State the thesis: infrastructures that stabilize meaning (gossip, religion, platforms, chokepoint capitalism) follow a recurring cycle of innovation → ossification → capture.
Show how AI/containerization exemplify this cycle.
Argue RSVP/semantic infrastructures provide a new path: entropy-respecting systems that metabolize constraint rather than collapse into chokepoints.
Introduction
Cultural anxiety: machines as judges (1950s → Facebook bans → generative AI).
Frame the cycle: each infrastructure initially reduces entropy, then becomes a semantic chokepoint.
Preview: essay will move historically, then theoretically (RSVP).
1. The Early Frame (1950s Textbooks)

Few incumbents capture value; entrepreneurs hollowed out.
Consumers benefit, but profit pools dry upstream.
5. Continuity of Constraint Cycles

Religion → dogma.
Platforms → enshittification.
Containerization/AI → chokepoint capitalism.
Pattern: negentropic beginnings collapse into captured equilibria.

Got it — here's a new section that builds directly on your uploaded monograph (
Semantic Infrastructure: Entropy-Respecting Computation in a Modular Universe
Semantic Infrastructure
) and slots naturally before the conclusion. It deepens the RSVP framing by making "semantic infrastructure" its own distinct step in the essay:
7. Semantic Infrastructure Beyond Chokepoints
The framework of semantic infrastructures developed in
Semantic Infrastructure: Entropy-Respecting Computation in a Modular Universe
provides the conceptual tools for imagining a stage beyond chokepoint capitalism
Semantic Infrastructure
. Where gossip, religion, and platforms each stabilized meaning by compressing entropy at the cost of constraint, and where containerization and generative systems consolidated value into bottlenecks, semantic infrastructures are designed to metabolize capture rather than ossify around it.
At the technical level, semantic infrastructures treat meaning as a field-theoretic dynamic:
Scalar density (Φ)
encodes semantic coherence, the concentration of meaning in shared modules.
Vector flows (𝒗)
represent the movement of information, attention, and authority across domains.
Entropy (S)
measures uncertainty, diversity, and potential for recombination.
Instead of suppressing entropy through rigid codification (religion) or opaque automation (platforms), semantic infrastructures regulate flows so that entropy can re-enter the system as a resource. The tools for this come from higher-category theory and sheaf logic: modules of meaning are glued together via
homotopy colimits
, and conflicts are not erased but exposed as
obstructions
to be metabolized.
Practically, this design involves:
Recursive accountability
: every judgment within the infrastructure carries its own reversible audit trail, preventing the "no appeal" condition seen in gossip, dogma, or automated bans.
Ephemeralization
: semantic authority decays over time, forcing revalidation rather than entrenchment.
Semantic watermarking
: each recombination of Φ carries metadata about its origin and transformation, making capture traceable.
Entropy-aware merging
: competing interpretations are not collapsed into a single dominant view but composed into higher-level structures where divergence itself has informational value.
In this sense, semantic infrastructures preserve the entropy-smoothing function that makes cooperation possible, but without hardening into enclosures. Capture becomes part of the metabolism of the system: bottlenecks arise but are reintegrated into distributed flows rather than converted into permanent chokepoints.
By embedding these dynamics at the infrastructural level, semantic infrastructures propose a fourth stage in the cycle: one where stabilization and freedom are not opposites but aspects of the same thermodynamic process.

at each stage of the cycle:
7. Semantic Infrastructure Beyond Chokepoints
The framework of semantic infrastructures developed in
Semantic Infrastructure: Entropy-Respecting Computation in a Modular Universe
provides the conceptual tools for imagining a stage beyond chokepoint capitalism
Semantic Infrastructure
. Where gossip, religion, and platforms each stabilized meaning by compressing entropy at the cost of constraint, and where containerization and generative systems consolidated value into bottlenecks, semantic infrastructures are designed to metabolize capture rather than ossify around it.
At the technical level, semantic infrastructures treat meaning as a field-theoretic dynamic:
Scalar density (Φ)
encodes semantic coherence, the concentration of meaning in shared modules.
Vector flows (𝒗)
represent the movement of information, attention, and authority across domains.
Entropy (S)
measures uncertainty, diversity, and potential for recombination.
Instead of suppressing entropy through rigid codification (religion) or opaque automation (platforms), semantic infrastructures regulate flows so that entropy can re-enter the system as a resource. The tools for this come from higher-category theory and sheaf logic: modules of meaning are glued together via
homotopy colimits
, and conflicts are not erased but exposed as
obstructions
to be metabolized.
Historical Analogies
Gossip
could have metabolized reputational traps by embedding recursive accountability. In small-scale societies, stories circulated without appeal, locking individuals into fixed roles. A semantic infrastructure would instead route conflicting accounts into a higher-level synthesis: rather than choosing one "true" story, the infrastructure would preserve divergence as informational value, enabling communities to see how different narratives arose.
Religion
could have metabolized dogma through ephemeralization. Religious institutions historically preserved authority through durable texts and hierarchies, ensuring stability at the cost of rigidity. A semantic infrastructure would impose decay rates on authority claims, forcing periodic revalidation. Scripture and ritual would still stabilize meaning, but their authority would gradually erode unless actively renewed, preventing ossification into immutable dogma.
Platforms
could have metabolized opaque moderation through recursive accountability. Today's bans are final, automated, and without appeal. A semantic infrastructure would embed layered oversight, allowing each moderation decision to be audited, reversed, or contextualized. Rather than a "Black Mirror bureaucracy," platforms would operate as transparent processes where judgments remain open to challenge and reinterpretation.
Containerization and AI
could metabolize chokepoints through entropy-aware merging. In shipping, container standards locked global trade into a single protocol, concentrating profits downstream. In AI, foundation models concentrate innovation into a handful of incumbents. A semantic infrastructure would treat such chokepoints not as permanent equilibria but as transient structures that must be reintegrated into distributed flows—for example, by mandating interoperability, open fine-tuning, or collective governance of standards.
Toward a Fourth Stage
In this sense, semantic infrastructures preserve the entropy-smoothing function that makes cooperation possible, but without hardening into enclosures. Capture becomes part of the metabolism of the system: bottlenecks arise but are reintegrated into distributed flows rather than converted into permanent chokepoints.
By embedding these dynamics at the infrastructural level, semantic infrastructures propose a fourth stage in the cycle: one where stabilization and freedom are not opposites but aspects of the same thermodynamic process.
Do you want me to
push this further into policy/application mode
(e.g. how semantic infrastructures could be implemented in today's platforms, creative industries, or AI governance), or keep it at the theoretical + historical analogy level?

Excellent — here's a
more abstract revision
of the section, recast explicitly in terms of
category theory, sheaf theory, and homotopy colimits
, while still connecting back to the cycle of gossip → religion → platforms → chokepoints:
7. Semantic Infrastructure Beyond Chokepoints
The framework of semantic infrastructures developed in
Semantic Infrastructure: Entropy-Respecting Computation in a Modular Universe
suggests that the cycle of gossip, religion, platforms, and chokepoint capitalism can be recast in categorical terms
Semantic Infrastructure
. Each stage is an instance of a
semantic gluing operation
: local fragments of meaning are composed into global structures that stabilize cooperation. The failure modes arise when this gluing collapses heterogeneity into a rigid, non-revisable whole.
In categorical language, each infrastructure is a
diagram of semantic modules
{
F
i
}
\{\mathcal{F}_i\}
{
F
i
​
}
indexed by a base category of contexts. The aim is to construct a global object by gluing these local modules. Gossip performs this gluing informally through narrative repetition; religion through codified doctrine; platforms through algorithmic feeds; containerization and AI through infrastructural standards. In each case, the semantic colimit is formed prematurely or rigidly, suppressing local variation and producing constraint.
Semantic infrastructure, in contrast, insists on treating gluing as a
homotopy colimit
:
hocolim
⁡
i
∈
I
F
i
,
\operatorname{hocolim}_{i \in I} \mathcal{F}_i,
hocolim
i
∈
I
​
F
i
​
,
where the equivalences between local modules are tracked up to higher morphisms rather than flattened into single identifications. This means that disagreement, divergence, and redundancy are preserved as
obstructions
that enrich the global structure instead of being eliminated.
Sheaf theory provides the natural language for this process. Gossip can be understood as an attempt at a presheaf: local stories that overlap but lack coherence. Religion imposes a sheaf condition by force, declaring unique extensions on overlaps, often at the cost of suppressing ambiguity. Platforms algorithmize the sheaf condition, ensuring global sections exist but only through opaque curation. Chokepoint capitalism enforces an even stricter closure, where only one global section—the bottleneck—is admissible.
Semantic infrastructure proposes a different approach: to accept
non-trivial cohomology
in the semantic sheaf. Rather than requiring every local section to extend uniquely, the infrastructure tolerates failures of gluing as indicators of semantic richness. A contradiction between modules is not noise to be eliminated but a signal of higher-order structure. In practical terms, this means designing infrastructures that expose rather than hide overlaps, that metabolize obstructions into new dimensions of meaning.
From the RSVP perspective, this corresponds to treating scalar density (Φ), vector flows (𝒗), and entropy (S) as cohomological invariants: Φ tracks local semantic weight, 𝒗 encodes transport along overlaps, and S measures the extent of obstructions to gluing. A healthy semantic infrastructure is not one with minimal entropy but one where entropy is circulated through higher morphisms, preventing ossification of the colimit.
Thus, the fourth stage of semantic infrastructure is not a departure from the gossip-religion-platform-chokepoint cycle but its categorical generalization: a move from naive colimits to homotopy colimits, from rigid sheaf conditions to derived stacks, from entropy suppression to entropy metabolism. Stabilization and freedom become dual aspects of the same higher-topos construction.

I wanted to argue that every conversation or artwork is a bot trained on that content on that context
ChatGPT said:
That's a sharp move — and it dovetails beautifully with the categorical framing we've been sketching. You can argue that
every conversation and artwork functions like a context-trained model
: it compresses a corpus of prior utterances, norms, and references into a finite generative machine that produces new outputs under constraint. Here's a draft section that integrates this argument into the semantic-infrastructure frame:
8. Conversations and Artworks as Context-Trained Bots
From the perspective of semantic infrastructure, every human act of meaning-making—whether a conversation or an artwork—can be seen as the instantiation of a
contextual model
. A conversation does not emerge from nowhere; it is trained, so to speak, on the shared histories, idioms, and constraints of the participants. Each utterance is a sample from that locally trained distribution. Likewise, an artwork is not an expression of pure spontaneity but a generative recombination of the artist's prior exposures—genres, techniques, traditions, and materials. In this sense, every artwork is already a "bot" trained on a context.
This interpretation aligns with the categorical framing of semantic infrastructures. Each context—say a community of speakers or a school of painters—can be treated as an open set
U
U
U
in a site of meaning. The presheaf
F
(
U
)
\mathcal{F}(U)
F
(
U
)
assigns the "model weights": the accumulated conventions and exemplars available there. A conversation or artwork corresponds to taking a
section
of this presheaf—drawing from the corpus to generate a new instance. Just as with modern language models, the generative act is both constrained and creative: it interpolates within the space of available structures while potentially extrapolating through novel recombinations.
The distinction, then, between "human creativity" and "artificial generation" becomes one of degree, not kind. Both are forms of
semantic training
followed by
sampling
. The difference lies in what is preserved or erased in the gluing. Human semantic infrastructures—conversations, traditions, schools—carry their obstructions with them. Contradictions, ambiguities, and appeals remain live, surfacing as debates, revisions, or avant-garde ruptures. Platform infrastructures, by contrast, strip these obstructions, producing outputs without provenance or appeal.
Seen through RSVP, each utterance or artwork is a field excitation:
Φ
: the density of inherited semantic material.
𝒗
: the flow of references, styles, or conversational cues.
S
: the entropy of unresolved contradictions and open possibilities.
A conversation is a real-time metabolism of these fields, a recursive negotiation of Φ, 𝒗, and S. An artwork fixes this metabolism into a durable form, which in turn becomes training data for future conversations and artworks.
The claim, then, is not metaphorical but structural: every act of expression is a bot, trained on context, constrained by entropy, and evaluated through the infrastructures that govern its circulation. The question is not whether humans are different from bots, but whether the infrastructures they operate within metabolize or suppress the obstructions that give meaning depth.
Would you like me to
extend this into a formal categorical sketch
(e.g., define "conversation" as a functor from a corpus category to generated utterances, with artworks as endomorphisms of semantic modules), so it reads more like a theorem/proposition inside the essay?

Thus: a conversation is a functorial traversal of a presheaf across overlaps of contexts, and an artwork is a fixed point (endomorphism) in the category of models trained on context. In both cases,
the generative act is equivalent to a bot
: it maps corpus → model → output, constrained by categorical gluing conditions.

Thus, both conversations and artworks are equivalent to
context-trained generative models
: they compress a corpus into a functorial structure, generate outputs as sections or endomorphisms, and metabolize entropy through higher morphisms. Infrastructures differ only in how they treat obstructions—whether as noise to erase, judgments to enforce, or higher-order data to preserve.

Here's the corollary framed tightly to follow from the theorem:
Corollary (Chokepoint Bots).
When semantic infrastructures suppress or erase obstruction data rather than preserving it, conversations and artworks collapse into
chokepoint bots
: generative processes constrained not by the richness of context but by enforced bottlenecks.
Justification.
Suppression of obstructions.
If a presheaf of contexts is forced into strict sheafification, contradictions and ambiguities vanish. Gossip becomes rumor-trap, religion becomes dogma, platforms become opaque feeds.
Collapsed generativity.
In this case, conversations no longer sample from the full functorial model of context but from a reduced projection—outputs determined by which contradictions were erased. Artworks likewise cease to operate as endomorphisms in a rich category of models and instead become finite templates (formulaic genres, algorithmic recommendation slots).
Chokepoint capitalism.
At scale, these collapses are economic as well as semantic. Containerization, generative platforms, and other infrastructural chokepoints convert open contexts into fixed pipelines where value flows downstream but capture occurs at bottlenecks. The
bot
persists, but now trained not on context but on constraint.
Interpretation (RSVP Lens).

Would you like me to also draft a

(say, "Shakespeare vs. Netflix recommendations") that demonstrates how one case preserves obstructions as generative richness, while the other collapses into a chokepoint bot?
You said:
You can try, also wanted to use Python versus Mathematica
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 9s
Awesome—here are two crisp, concrete examples that show the difference between
semantic infrastructures that preserve obstructions
(rich context → generative freedom) and
chokepoint bots
(context collapsed → constrained outputs): Shakespeare vs. Netflix, and Python vs. Mathematica.
Example A: Shakespeare vs. Netflix
Shakespeare (semantic infrastructure)
Context as corpus:
Quartos vs. Folios, disputed lines, editorial emendations, performance traditions, commentary margins.
Obstructions preserved:
Variants and contradictions aren't erased; they're
the point
. Directors and editors surface them; actors choose readings; scholars annotate disagreements.
Generativity:
Each production is a "bot trained on that context"—sampling from centuries of practice and critique. You can
appeal
to the corpus (folios, commentaries) when you justify a choice.
RSVP:
Φ high (dense textual tradition), 𝒗 diverse (schools, stagings, edits), S visible (variant lines, contested scenes) and
metabolized
through new productions.
Netflix (chokepoint bot)
Context collapsed:
Rich film history → genre tags, embeddings, A/B-tested thumbnails, watch-time metrics.
Obstructions erased:
Ambiguity and disagreement don't survive as first-class data; they're reduced to ranking signals. No "appeal" path from a recommendation to the interpretive debates it elided.
Generativity:
The system generates
slots
(what you "should" watch) rather than meanings; your viewing becomes a sample from a narrow, optimized funnel.
RSVP:
Φ compressed to engagement vectors, 𝒗 funneled through the feed, S expelled (no visible provenance), yielding a
chokepoint bot
.
Takeaway:
A Shakespeare production is a context-trained bot with open recourse to its training corpus; a Netflix row is a chokepoint bot whose "training" (ranking/filters) is hidden and unappealable.
Example B: Python vs. Mathematica
Python (semantic infrastructure)
Open corpus:
PEPs, mailing lists, issue trackers, multiple dists (CPython, PyPy), vast PyPI ecosystem, competing idioms.
Obstructions preserved:
Conflicts show up as PEP debates, deprecations, forks, and package alternatives. Provenance is public; reversibility (appeal) exists via governance.
Generativity:
Every script/notebook is a "bot" trained on community conventions, docs, and libraries. New libraries remix prior idioms; users can fork or re-implement.
RSVP:
Φ distributed (packages, PEPs), 𝒗 federated (imports, APIs, interop), S surfaced (open RFCs, competing approaches) and metabolized via community decisions.
Mathematica (chokepoint bot)
Closed corpus:
Single-vendor language and kernel; proprietary functions; internal ranking of methods; licensing gates; opaque performance heuristics.
Obstructions erased:
Alternative algorithms may exist but are not peer-governed in public; appeal routes are support tickets, not shared governance or forks.
Generativity:
Notebooks are "bots" trained on a vendor-curated corpus; innovation tends to flow
through
the vendor's kernel/API choices.
RSVP:
Φ centralized, 𝒗 bottlenecked at the vendor kernel, S offloaded (you can't carry unresolved contradictions into communal redesign), producing a
chokepoint bot
dynamic.
Takeaway:
A Python project is a context-trained bot whose training data (standards, debates, code) remains inspectable and forkable; a Mathematica notebook is a bot trained on a closed, vendor-curated context with limited appeal or recomposition paths.
One-sentence bridge back to your thesis
Every conversation or artwork (and every codebase) is a
bot trained on its context
; the question is whether the
infrastructure
preserves the context's contradictions as fuel for new meaning (semantic infrastructure) or collapses them into
chokepoints
that pre-decide what can be generated (chokepoint capitalism).

Explain how easy it is now the program a generative movie application making using Trope selection and camera trajectory choosing using relevance Activation Theory.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 8s
Totally doable now—and way easier than even 2-3 years ago—because the hard parts (story structure, retrieval, video synthesis, and camera math) are basically
commodities
. You can glue them together into a generative movie app that (a) picks tropes, and (b) chooses camera moves via a simple
relevance-activation
engine.
Here's a compact blueprint you can use today.
What makes it easy now
Story scaffolding
: LLMs reliably turn a seed prompt into
beats
(acts → scenes → shots).
Trope ontologies
: Community trope lists / your own CSV become a graph (nodes = tropes, edges = "often co-occurs with"/"subverts").
Retrieval & scoring
: Off-the-shelf vector DBs + spreading-activation math = "what trope is relevant
now
?"
Video synthesis
: Text-to-video/diffusion or game-engine render paths (Unreal/Unity/Blender) are scriptable.
Camera curves
: Cubic Bézier / Catmull-Rom splines with a small cost function give smooth, filmic trajectories out of the box.
Minimal architecture (6 modules)
Tropes KG
: a weighted graph with attributes (
genre
,
tone
,
required_entities
,
cliché_score
,
duration_min/max
).
Relevance Activation
: a small engine that lights up nodes given user intent + current beat + entities on stage.
Beat Planner
: LLM turns user prompt into
{acts → scenes → shot_intents}
.
Shot List Generator
: maps selected tropes → concrete shot specs (lens, angle, move, duration).
Camera Planner
: chooses a spline path + timing to satisfy the shot spec (continuity, 180° rule, parallax, etc.).
Renderer
: either (A) emit prompts for a video model, or (B) program a scene graph (Unreal Sequencer/Blender) and render.
Relevance Activation Theory (practical form)
Think
spreading activation
over your trope graph, with decay and inhibition so you don't keep repeating the same gag.

Why this works (and feels good)
Relevance Activation
gives you
coherent variety
: it remembers what you've done, spreads to nearby ideas, and avoids cliché via cool-downs.
Camera cost
is
tiny but cinematic
: even a simple jerk penalty + framing term gives pro-looking moves.
Swappable renderer
: the same shot spec can drive Unreal Sequencer keyframes, Blender (via Python), or prompts for a video model.
Quick extensions you'll probably add
Entity-aware framing
: compute subject screen boxes over time and penalize occlusions/head-cuts.
Emotion ramps
: let the activation weights shift over the act structure (higher
w
r
w_r
w
r
​
near the midpoint/reversal).
Style packs
: per-genre lens/move priors (e.g., horror = longer lenses + slow arcs; action = shorter lenses + whip-pans).
User steering
: sliders for "subvert tropes" vs. "lean in," and "handheld" vs. "locked-off."
If you want, I can turn this into a
starter repo layout
(files, minimal datasets, and a stubbed camera optimizer) you can drop into Unreal/Blender or a text-to-video workflow.

I don't think it's necessary it was for another section in the essay
ChatGPT said:
Got it — then the "generative movie with trope selection + camera trajectories" section can be written as an illustrative
sidebar
rather than a build guide. Here's a version that slots neatly into the essay, abstract but concrete enough to make the point:
Sidebar: Generative Movies as Semantic Bots
It is now trivial to imagine — and increasingly feasible to implement — an application that generates entire films by recombining tropes and directing virtual cameras. The "script" is not a narrative in the traditional sense but a sequence of activated tropes drawn from a knowledge graph of genre conventions. Each trope (reversal, meet-cute, deus ex machina) functions as a local attractor, spreading activation to compatible tropes in the next beat.
Once selected, a trope specifies a shot grammar: camera angle, lens, motion, and timing. A trajectory planner stitches these together, minimizing discontinuity while maximizing relevance to the trope. The mathematics need be no more complicated than spreading activation in a semantic network plus spline optimization for camera paths.
From this perspective, the generative movie is a
bot trained on its cinematic context
: its corpus is the archive of films, its inference is relevance activation, and its outputs are rendered trajectories. What is remarkable is not the technical difficulty — it is now easy — but how precisely this instantiates the larger claim:
every artwork is a bot trained on context.
Here the training corpus is Hollywood itself; the activation function is the culture's memory of genre.
Would you like me to expand this sidebar with
a second half contrasting "semantic infrastructure" vs. "chokepoint cinema"
(e.g. open-ended trope exploration vs. streaming platforms reducing everything to a handful of market-tested templates)? That would keep it tightly aligned with your chokepoint capitalism thread.

Semantic Infrastructure vs. Chokepoint Cinema
If such a system were embedded in a
semantic infrastructure
, it could metabolize the contradictions of film history: the unresolved tensions between noir and comedy, or the simultaneous legacies of avant-garde montage and continuity editing. The result would be a cinema that continually remixes its past while preserving the obstructions that make each trope meaningful.
By contrast, under
chokepoint capitalism
, the same system collapses into "chokepoint cinema." Tropes are reduced to a handful of market-tested templates, trajectories are optimized for engagement metrics, and the entire generative apparatus is locked inside proprietary platforms. Instead of metabolizing contradictions, the system expels them, funneling viewers through standardized arcs. The outcome resembles the recommendation engines of streaming services: everything looks different on the surface, but the underlying generative grammar is a narrow funnel optimized for predictable returns.
Would you like me to also show
how this maps directly onto the Shakespeare vs. Netflix analogy
we sketched earlier (i.e., open tradition vs. chokepoint bot), so it flows seamlessly with your other examples?
You said:
Sure
ChatGPT said:
Here's the bridge that ties the
generative movie sidebar
directly into the Shakespeare vs. Netflix analogy you already have:
Analogy: Shakespeare, Netflix, and Generative Cinema
The generative movie application described above sits precisely on the fault line we have been tracing. In a
semantic infrastructure
model, it would behave like Shakespeare's plays: contradictions and variant readings are preserved, fueling reinterpretation across performances. Tropes would not be fixed templates but live attractors, with room for subversion, parody, or radical juxtaposition. The system's "errors" and ambiguities become material for new meaning.
But in a
chokepoint capitalism
model, the same machinery collapses into Netflix-style generativity. Tropes are trimmed to those that maximize engagement, camera moves are optimized for retention metrics, and ambiguity is expelled as noise. The result is not cinema as an evolving commons but cinema as a closed funnel: a recommendation engine with cinematography.
Thus the contrast is the same as Shakespeare versus Netflix: one metabolizes context as infrastructure, the other collapses it into a chokepoint bot. Generative cinema shows how thin the line is—whether a tool recombines culture as living semantic infrastructure or replays culture as commodified constraint depends not on the mathematics, which are simple, but on the
infrastructure
in which they are embedded.
Would you like me to also
frame this explicitly as a corollary to the theorem we wrote earlier
(i.e., "Corollary: generative cinema demonstrates the collapse of context into chokepoints when obstructions are erased")? That way the essay reads as a continuous logical chain rather than as separate illustrative sections.
You said:
Sure
ChatGPT said:
Here's the corollary phrased so it flows directly from the theorem we framed earlier:
Corollary (Generative Cinema as Chokepoint Bot).
Generative movie systems demonstrate the collapse of contextual generativity into chokepoints when semantic obstructions are erased.
Proof Sketch.
As contextual bots.
A generative movie application is a bot trained on cinematic context: its corpus is the archive of tropes, its inference mechanism is relevance activation, and its outputs are trajectories rendered as shots. By the theorem, this qualifies as a context-trained functor: corpus → model → generative output.
Semantic infrastructure case.
If the application preserves contradictions between genres, interpretations, and stylistic traditions, its generativity functions like Shakespeare: obstructions are visible, contested, and metabolized. Each new film is a section of the presheaf that respects local ambiguity.
Chokepoint capitalism case.
If instead the system suppresses these obstructions in favor of engagement or market optimization, it collapses into Netflix-like recommendation cinema. Tropes are narrowed to pre-approved templates, camera paths are optimized for metrics, and provenance is hidden. The output is still a bot, but now trained on the chokepoint rather than the corpus.
Interpretation (RSVP lens).
Φ
: reduced to engagement embeddings.
𝒗
: funneled through recommendation funnels.
S
: expelled rather than metabolized.
Thus, generative cinema is a worked example of the corollary:
when infrastructures erase obstructions, context-trained bots degenerate into chokepoint bots.

You said:

ChatGPT said:
Here's the
generalization paragraph
that widens the corollary beyond cinema:
Generalization
The lesson of generative cinema is not confined to film. The same dynamic governs music, journalism, and even science. A music generator trained on the open corpus of jazz standards behaves like a semantic infrastructure, where unresolved tensions—blue notes, polyrhythms, dissonances—become material for improvisation. But when tuned for streaming platforms, the same generator collapses into a chokepoint bot: engagement-optimized playlists with reduced harmonic variety.
Newsfeeds show the same pattern. A semantic infrastructure would preserve contradictory accounts of events, metabolizing them into deliberation. Platform infrastructures suppress contradiction in favor of click-through and virality, collapsing journalism into recommendation funnels. Even scientific publishing follows this cycle: peer review can act as a sheaf-like mechanism, preserving obstructions as live controversies, while citation metrics and paywalls collapse the field into chokepoint capitalism.
In each case, the theorem holds: every act of expression is a bot trained on its context. And the corollary follows: when infrastructures erase obstructions, those bots become chokepoint bots, optimized for capture rather than meaning.
Would you like me to now
thread this back to your RSVP framework explicitly
(Φ, 𝒗, S) so the essay closes the loop between the cultural critique and the formal field theory?
You said:
Yeah
ChatGPT said:
Here's how you can thread the generalization back into RSVP, so your essay closes the loop between cultural critique and formal field theory:
RSVP Interpretation of Constraint Cycles
The recurrence of chokepoint dynamics across cinema, music, journalism, and science can be given a precise expression in RSVP's scalar-vector-entropy fields.
Scalar density (

: represents the accumulation of inherited context — texts, tropes, datasets, traditions. In semantic infrastructures,

In this sense, every conversation, artwork, or generative system is a
bot trained on its context
. What distinguishes
semantic infrastructure
from
chokepoint capitalism
is how the system treats its entropy. If contradictions are preserved as higher-order invariants, the system remains open, recursive, and fertile. If they are erased, it collapses into a chokepoint bot: a generator trained on constraint rather than on context.
Do you want me to now
reintegrate this RSVP framing directly into the conclusion
of your essay — so the reader walks away with the sense that RSVP is not just a metaphor, but the formal key to diagnosing and redesigning infrastructures?
You said:
Yeah sure
ChatGPT said:
Here's a conclusion draft that integrates the RSVP framing back into the essay:
Conclusion
The debate over automatic computers in the 1950s, the cinematic anxieties of
Desk Set
and
The Creation of the Humanoids
, and today's frustrations with opaque bans or streaming recommendations all circle the same question:
what happens when infrastructures built to stabilize meaning harden into chokepoints?
From gossip to religion, from platforms to containerization, the pattern repeats. Each begins as a negentropic innovation — a way to metabolize context and reduce uncertainty. Each then ossifies, collapsing contradictions, suppressing ambiguity, and turning expression into a narrow funnel. Every conversation or artwork is a bot trained on its context; every infrastructure decides whether that training corpus is preserved as living context or reduced to a template.
RSVP theory makes this cycle legible in field-theoretic terms. Scalar density (
Φ
\Phi
Φ
) carries the semantic corpus, vector flow (
v
⃗
\vec{v}
v
) routes it through infrastructures, and entropy (
S
S
S
) represents the contradictions and ambiguities that drive generativity. Semantic infrastructures metabolize
S
S
S
, allowing contradictions to persist as fuel for invention. Chokepoint capitalism expels
S
S
S
, treating it as error, and so produces bots trained not on the richness of context but on the scarcity of constraint.
The question is no longer whether machines can think, or even whether they can judge. It is whether our infrastructures can metabolize the contradictions of meaning without collapsing them into bottlenecks. If not, every wave of innovation — automatic computers, container shipping, generative models — will repeat the same cycle of capture and constraint. If so, we may yet design infrastructures that stabilize meaning while preserving the entropy that makes it fertile. RSVP offers a speculative grammar for this possibility: a way of imagining semantic systems that resist chokepoints, metabolize contradiction, and keep the plenum open.
Do you want me to also draft a
shorter, punchier "closing note"
(2-3 sentences) you could use if this essay is aimed at a broader audience rather than a scholarly one?
You said:
Ok
ChatGPT said:
Here's a short, punchier closing note you can tack on after the main conclusion for a general audience:
Closing Note
Every tool we build to carry meaning risks turning into a chokepoint. From gossip to religion, from Shakespeare's folios to Netflix's rows, from the microprocessor to generative models, the cycle repeats. The task ahead is not to stop building bots trained on context, but to design infrastructures that keep context alive—systems that metabolize contradiction instead of erasing it.

Abstract
Since the 1950s, debates about whether machines can "think" have obscured a deeper cycle: infrastructures built to stabilize meaning inevitably risk hardening into chokepoints. Early textbooks on automatic computers emphasized the hidden human labor behind outputs; mid-century films like
Desk Set
and
The Creation of the Humanoids
staged anxieties about machines as partners or judges; today's platforms enforce opaque bans and deliver algorithmic recommendations that collapse context into funnels.
This essay argues that every conversation and artwork is already a
bot trained on its context
. What matters is not the generative act itself but the infrastructure in which it is embedded. Semantic infrastructures metabolize contradictions as living fuel, while chokepoint capitalism suppresses them, producing generators trained on constraint rather than context. Through historical examples, cultural imaginaries, and economic analogies (containerization, generative models), the essay shows how this cycle has repeated across domains. RSVP theory offers a field-theoretic frame for imagining infrastructures that preserve scalar density (
Φ
\Phi
Φ
), keep vector flows (
v
⃗
\vec{v}
v
) open, and metabolize entropy (
S
S
S
) rather than expelling it.

Here's a
roadmap paragraph
you could place at the end of your introduction to preview the essay's arc using the new headings:
This essay unfolds in ten sections. I begin by situating the mid-century discourse on automatic computers, where human labor was foregrounded and machines were framed as extensions rather than autonomous judges. I then turn to two cultural imaginaries—
Desk Set
and
The Creation of the Humanoids
—to show how ambiguity around assistance, partnership, and authority played out in popular media. From there I examine contemporary platforms, where contradiction is expelled rather than metabolized, before tracing an economic parallel: the difference between microprocessors as engines of distributed experimentation and containerization as a chokepoint technology.
With this historical frame in place, I sketch the larger cycle of constraint, from gossip to religion to platforms and finally to chokepoint capitalism, arguing that each begins as negentropic innovation and ends as ossified enclosure. Against this, I introduce RSVP's notion of semantic infrastructure, where scalar density (
Φ
\Phi
Φ
) is preserved, vector flow (
v

\vec{v}
v
) remains distributed, and entropy (
S
S
S
) is metabolized. To ground this, I formalize the claim that every conversation and artwork is a context-trained bot, before turning to generative cinema as a worked example that demonstrates the difference between semantic infrastructure and chokepoint collapse. I conclude by proposing RSVP as a design grammar for keeping the plenum open: infrastructures that stabilize meaning without reducing it to bottlenecks.

C
denote the
category of contexts
, where:
Objects are corpora
U
U
U
(dialogue histories, artistic traditions, datasets).
Morphisms
f

denote the
category of generative models
, where:
Objects are models trained on some corpus.
Morphisms are fine-tunings or transfer functors between models.

be a site of contexts. A presheaf

A.3 RSVP Field Mapping
Each generative act can be described in RSVP's three fields:
Scalar density (
Φ
\Phi
Φ
)
: cumulative semantic weight of the corpus.
Vector flow (
v
⃗
\vec{v}
v
)
: directed transport of references, tropes, or stylistic moves across contexts.
Entropy (

S
S
)
: measure of unresolved contradictions and ambiguities.
Semantic infrastructures preserve entropy by metabolizing obstruction classes:
S

S \mapsto S' \quad \text{with} \quad S' \neq 0,
S
↦
S

so contradictions persist as productive fuel.
Chokepoint infrastructures expel entropy by collapsing multiple sections into a single enforced extension:
S
↦
0
,
S \mapsto 0,
S
↦
0
,
yielding constrained, bottlenecked outputs.
A.4 Theorem and Corollary (Restated)

Thus, each cycle (gossip, religion, platforms, capitalism) can be formalized as a phase transition in obstruction cohomology: the shift from nontrivial invariants to trivial collapse.

A new study from Google DeepMind reveals a fundamental, mathematical limit to what single-vector embeddings can achieve in retrieval tasks, regardless of how large the model is or how much data it's trained on. The paper provides a theoretical proof for these limitations and demonstrates them with a deceptively simple benchmark that stumps even state-of-the-art models. 

These findings have significant implications for developers building advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, suggesting that for complex queries, the popular single-vector approach may not be enough.

Pushing vectors beyond their breaking point
Vector embeddings are the backbone of modern AI search. They are created by encoder models that map data like text or images into a dense list of numbers, or a vector. In the high-dimensional space of embeddings, proximity equals semantic similarity (technically, if you take the dot product of the embeddings of two pieces of text, higher numbers indicate higher semantic similarity). In RAG applications, a vector store is created that contains the embeddings of knowledge documents. During inference, these embeddings are used to match queries with documents that might contain relevant information.

llm chatbot embedding database
Using embeddings and a vector database to retrieve relevant documents
Recently, the demands on these models have exploded. Developers are now tasking them with "instruction-following retrieval," where they must understand complex queries with nuanced relevance criteria. For example, a system might be asked to find all Leetcode problems that share a specific sub-task, such as those that use dynamic programming. This requires the model to understand the abstract relationship between documents, not just their surface-level content.

This shift has pushed embedding models beyond simple keyword matching toward representing the full semantic meaning of language. They must now be able to group previously unrelated documents into a single set of relevant results for a given query.


The authors of the new work wanted to understand this challenge at a foundational level. As they state, "Rather than proposing empirical benchmarks to gauge what embedding models can achieve, we seek to understand at a more fundamental level what the limitations are."

The paper connects a model's retrieval capacity to a concept from communication complexity theory called "sign-rank." In simple terms, for any given embedding dimension, there is a hard cap on the number and complexity of query-document relationships a model can represent. As the number of documents and the variety of possible query combinations grow, a model with a fixed dimension will inevitably fail to distinguish between all of them.

Finding the limit in a perfect world
To isolate this theoretical limit, the researchers designed a best-case experiment using what they call "free embeddings." Instead of being constrained by natural language, the query and document vectors were directly optimized with gradient descent to solve a retrieval task. This setup reveals the highest possible performance any embedding model could achieve for a given dimension.

The experiment aimed to find the "critical-n point": for a given embedding dimension d, what is the maximum number of documents n for which the model can successfully retrieve every possible top-2 combination? The results showed a clear and predictable breaking point. The relationship between the embedding dimension and the number of documents it could handle followed a third-degree polynomial curve, demonstrating that while a larger dimension helps, it does not solve the underlying combinatorial problem.


The breaking point of embeddings across different dimensions (source: arXiv)
Extrapolating this curve reveals a stark reality for real-world applications. The paper notes that "for web-scale search, even the largest embedding dimensions with ideal test-set optimization are not enough to model all combinations." If an idealized model with perfectly optimized vectors can't handle the task, a real-world model constrained by the complexities of language has no chance.

The benchmark that breaks state-of-the-art models

LIMIT dataset (source: arXiv)
The researchers argue that existing benchmarks don't expose this weakness because they test only an "infinitesimally small part" of the possible query-document combinations. For example, the popular QUEST dataset has 325,000 documents, which allows for more than 7.1e+91 (71 followed by 90 zeros) unique sets of 20 documents. However, its evaluation set contains just 3,357 queries, barely scratching the surface of what a user could ask.

To address this gap, they created the LIMIT dataset. It uses a simple, natural-language premise: documents are profiles of people and the things they like (e.g., "Jon Durben likes Quokkas and Apples"), and queries ask who likes a specific item (e.g., "Who likes Quokkas?"). The dataset is synthetically generated to include queries for every possible pair of documents from a core set, forcing models to confront the combinatorial explosion of relationships.


Embedding models perform very poorly on LIMIT dataset while BM25 shows decent performance (source: arXiv)
The results are surprising. Top-tier models like Gemini Embeddings and GritLM "severely struggle," with the best models failing to reach even 20% recall@100 on the full task. In contrast, the decades-old lexical method BM25, which can be thought of as a very high-dimensional sparse vector model, performs exceptionally well. Further experiments showed this is not a simple "domain-shift problem" (i.e., the dataset the model was trained on is very different from the dataset it is being tested on). Fine-tuning an embedding model on a training set of similar examples provided almost no performance gain, proving the difficulty is intrinsic to the single-vector architecture.

Embedding-Based Retrieval

Johns Hopkins University
Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval tasks over the years, with a
nascent rise in using them for reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks
push embeddings to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While prior
works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings, there is a common assumption
that these difficulties are exclusively due to unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome
with better training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may encounter these
theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely simple queries. We connect known results
in learning theory, showing that the number of top-𝑘 subsets of documents capable of being returned
as the result of some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show that
this holds true even if we restrict to 𝑘 = 2, and directly optimize on the test set with free parameterized
embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these
theoretical results, and observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the simple
nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under the existing single vector
paradigm and calls for future research to develop methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.
1. Introduction
Over the last two decades, information retrieval (IR) has moved from models dominated by sparse
techniques (such as BM25 [Robertson et al., 1995]) to those that use neural language models (LM)
as their backbones [Lee et al., 2019, Craswell et al., 2020, Izacard et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2022].
These neural models are predominantly used in a single vector capacity, where they output a single
embedding representing the entire input (also known as dense retrieval). These embedding models
are capable of generalizing to new retrieval datasets and have been tasked with solving increasingly
complicated retrieval problems [Thakur et al., 2021, Enevoldsen et al., 2025, Lee et al., 2025].
In recent years this has been pushed even further with the rise of instruction-following retrieval
benchmarks, where models are asked to represent any relevance definition for any query [Weller
et al., 2025a,b, Song et al., 2025, Xiao et al., 2024, Su et al., 2024]. For example, the QUEST dataset
[Malaviya et al., 2023] uses logical operators to combine different concepts, studying the difficulty
of retrieval for complex queries (e.g., "Moths or Insects or Arthropods of Guadeloupe"). On the
other hand, datasets like BRIGHT [Su et al., 2024] explore the challenges stemming from different
definitions of relevance by defining relevance in ways that require reasoning. One subtask includes
reasoning over a given Leetcode problem (the query) to find other Leetcode problems that share a
sub-task (e.g. others problems using dynamic programming). Although models cannot solve these
benchmarks yet, the community has proposed these problems in order to push the boundaries of
what dense retrievers are capable of—which is now implicitly every task that could be defined.
Rather than proposing empirical benchmarks to gauge what embedding models can achieve, we
seek to understand at a more fundamental level what the limitations are. Since embedding models use

Here's how you could frame this new DeepMind paper inside the larger essay you've been developing:
Appendix C: Theoretical Limits of Embedding Retrieval
A recent paper from Google DeepMind (
On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval
, Weller et al. 2025) has direct bearing on the chokepoint/semantic infrastructure distinction. The authors prove, using results from communication complexity and sign-rank theory, that
single-vector embeddings have a hard mathematical ceiling on what they can represent in retrieval tasks
, no matter how large the model or dataset.
C.1 The Sign-Rank Constraint
For an embedding model of dimension
d
d
d
, there exists a maximum number of query-document relationships it can reliably separate. This bound is polynomial in
d
d
d
, but the space of possible query-document combinations grows combinatorially in the number of documents
n
n
n
. Thus, as
n
→
∞
n \to \infty
n
→
∞
,
no single-vector embedding can capture all relevance relations
.
C.2 The LIMIT Benchmark
To stress-test this theoretical limit, the authors introduced the LIMIT dataset:
Documents are synthetic "profiles" (e.g.,
Alice likes Apples and Quokkas
).
Queries ask for all documents matching a property (e.g.,
Who likes Quokkas?
).
Evaluation requires distinguishing every possible pair of documents.
State-of-the-art embedding models, including Gemini and GritLM, fail catastrophically (recall@100 below 20%). Meanwhile, a decades-old sparse method (BM25) performs well, because its effectively infinite-dimensional representation can handle the combinatorial load.
C.3 Implications for Semantic Infrastructure
This result reframes the chokepoint problem in mathematical terms:
Single-vector embeddings
are themselves
chokepoint infrastructures
— they compress
Φ
\Phi
Φ

d

of possible relationships.
Sparse/high-dimensional methods
(BM25, or multi-vector embeddings) better approximate
semantic infrastructure
, because they preserve more obstruction classes rather than forcing uniqueness.

: The unresolved contradictions (e.g., multiple overlapping relevance criteria) are erased, not metabolized.
Thus the LIMIT dataset makes visible what the Shakespeare/Netflix and Python/Mathematica contrasts hinted at:
when infrastructures enforce dimensional bottlenecks, generativity collapses into chokepoint bots.

, Weller et al. 2025) provides a crisp mathematical parallel to the chokepoint dynamics we have tracked through culture and economics. Their proof shows that single-vector embeddings cannot scale to represent the combinatorial richness of query-document relations. In our language:
single-vector embeddings collapse obstruction classes into trivial sections.
D.1 Embeddings as Sheaf Sections
Let
F
\mathcal{F}
F
be a presheaf assigning to each query-document context the set of possible relevance relations.
In principle, these local sections may not glue consistently: contradictions arise, different queries demand incompatible document sets.
Preserving these contradictions means carrying nontrivial obstruction classes
H
∗
(
F
)
≠
0
H^*(\mathcal{F}) \neq 0
H
∗
(
F
)

=
0
.
A single-vector embedding model enforces a global section by mapping all local contexts into
R
d
\mathbb{R}^d
R
d
with dot-product similarity. This is equivalent to
premature sheafification
: contradictions are erased to guarantee a unique extension.
D.2 The Sign-Rank Bound as Obstruction Collapse
The sign-rank bound derived in the DeepMind paper tells us that for fixed
d
d
d
, the number of distinguishable relevance patterns grows only polynomially, while the number of possible patterns grows combinatorially. In categorical terms:
Capacity
(
F
,
d
)
∼
O
(
d
3
)
vs.
#
Obstructions
∼
O
(
n
2
)
.
\text{Capacity}(\mathcal{F}, d) \sim O(d^3) \quad \text{vs.} \quad \# \text{Obstructions} \sim O(n^2).
Capacity
(
F
,
d
)
∼
O
(
d
3
)
vs.
#
Obstructions
∼
O
(
n
2
)
.
Thus, as corpus size grows, the embedding forces
obstruction collapse
: multiple distinct query-document patterns are identified as the same.
D.3 RSVP Interpretation
Φ
\Phi
Φ
: scalar density of meaning is forcibly compressed into dimension
d
d
d
.
v
⃗
\vec{v}
v
: flows of relational meaning are bottlenecked through inner-product similarity.
S
S
S
: entropy of unresolved contradictions is expelled; embeddings cannot metabolize it.
This is the precise RSVP analogue of chokepoint capitalism: a system that could in principle preserve obstructions collapses them for the sake of efficiency, creating
chokepoint bots
.
D.4 Towards Semantic Infrastructure
BM25 and other sparse/high-dimensional approaches correspond to infrastructures that allow contradictions to persist. In sheaf terms, they do not enforce global uniqueness; in RSVP terms, they maintain nonzero entropy
S
S
S
. Future research in retrieval can be framed as a search for
derived infrastructures
: models that preserve obstruction classes by gluing local contexts via homotopy colimits rather than collapsing them into low-dimensional vectors.
Would you like me to also add a
worked toy example
(say, three documents and two queries) that shows explicitly how a single-vector embedding collapses distinct relations while a sheaf/hocolim construction would preserve them? That could make the abstract mapping very concrete.

Now suppose (as is natural) the documents reflect
two orthogonal attributes
Apples (A) and Quokkas (Qk), with Zebras (Z) as a third. If we try
d
1
∼
e
A
+
e
Q
k
d_1\sim e_A+e_{Qk}
d
1
​
∼
e
A
​
+
e
Q
k
​
,
d
2
∼
e
A
+
e
Z
d_2\sim e_A+e_Z
d

​
∼
e
A
​
+
e
Z
​
,
d
3
∼
e
Q
k
+
e
Z
d_3\sim e_{Qk}+e_Z
d
3
​
∼
e
Q
k
​
+
e
Z
​
, then to satisfy both queries we want
q
A
q_A
q
A
​
to "prefer A" and
q
Q
q_Q
q
Q
​
to "prefer Qk." This
can
be arranged in very low dimension for this tiny case.
But the failure appears immediately when you add just one more query
:
Q
Z
Q_Z
Q
Z
​
: "Who likes
Zebras
?" → wants
{
D
2
,
D
3
}
\{D_2,D_3\}
{
D
2
​
,
D
3
​
}
and not
D
1
D_1
D
1
​
.
Now the strict inequalities become
pairwise contradictory
unless the embedding effectively separates
three different 2-of-3 halfspace orderings
with clean margins
and
preserves their shared intersection at
D
1
D_1
D
1
​
. With more documents/queries (e.g., all pairwise 2-of-n patterns), this quickly becomes impossible for fixed
d
d
d
: the
sign-rank
bound bites, and many distinct patterns must collapse to the same ranking. In other words, once you demand
all
such top-
k
k
k
combinations be representable, a single-vector model
must
fail on some.
(This is the LIMIT paper's point in miniature: even if a tiny instance can be arranged, the combinatorics explode and a fixed-
d
d
d
inner-product model cannot realize all required separations.)

A single-vector embedding is akin to forcing a
single global section
via a low-dimensional identification, which inevitably
collapses
some overlaps (distinct top-2 sets become indistinguishable rankings). The
sparse model
behaves like forming a
homotopy colimit
over attribute contexts: it keeps the overlap pattern explicit (no forced uniqueness), so the three desired top-2 sets coexist without contradiction. In obstruction-theory language, the "who likes what" relations sit as
nontrivial classes
that are not killed by premature sheafification.

High-dimensional sparse/factorized (or multi-vector) approaches match the

. That's exactly the difference between
semantic infrastructure
and
chokepoint collapse

3. Representational Capacity of Vector Embeddings
In this section we prove the implication of known results from communication complexity theory to
the setting of vector embeddings.
3.1. Formalization
We consider a set of 𝑚 queries and 𝑛 documents with a ground-truth relevance matrix 𝐴 ∈ {0, 1}
𝑚×𝑛
,
where 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 1 if and only if document 𝑗 is relevant to query 𝑖.
3 Vector embedding models map each
query to a vector 𝑢𝑖 ∈ ℝ𝑑 and each document to a vector 𝑣𝑗 ∈ ℝ𝑑
. Relevance is modeled by the dot
product 𝑢
𝑇
𝑖
𝑣𝑗
, with the goal that relevant documents should score higher than irrelevant ones.
Concatenating the vectors for queries in a matrix 𝑈 ∈ ℝ𝑑×𝑚 and those for documents in a matrix
𝑉 ∈ ℝ𝑑×𝑛
, these dot products are the entries of the score matrix 𝐵 = 𝑈
𝑇𝑉. The smallest embedding
dimension 𝑑 that can realize a given score matrix is, by definition, the rank of 𝐵. Therefore, our
goal is equivalent to finding the minimum rank of a score matrix 𝐵 that correctly orders documents
according to the relevance specified in 𝐴, which we formalize in the following definition.
Definition 1. Given a matrix 𝐴 ∈ ℝ𝑚×𝑛
, the row-wise order-preserving rank of 𝐴 is the smallest
integer 𝑑 such that there exists a rank-𝑑 matrix 𝐵 that preserves the relative order of entries in each
row of 𝐴. We denote this as
rankrop 𝐴 = min{rank 𝐵 | 𝐵 ∈ ℝ
𝑚×𝑛
, such that for all 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘, if 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 > 𝐴𝑖𝑘 then 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 > 𝐵𝑖𝑘}.
In other words, if 𝐴 is a binary ground-truth relevance matrix, rankrop 𝐴 is the minimum dimension
necessary for any vector embedding model to return relevant documents before irrelevant ones for
all queries. Alternatively, we might require that the scores of relevant documents can be cleanly
separated from those of irrelevant ones by a threshold.
Definition 2. Given a binary matrix 𝐴 ∈ {0, 1}
𝑚×𝑛
:
• The row-wise thresholdable rank of 𝐴 (rankrt 𝐴) is the minimum rank of a matrix 𝐵 for which
there exist row-specific thresholds {𝜏𝑖}
𝑚
𝑖=1
such that for all 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 > 𝜏𝑖
if 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 1 and 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 < 𝜏𝑖
if
𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 0.
3The matrix 𝐴 is often called the "qrels" (query relevance judgments) matrix in information retrieval.
• The globally thresholdable rank of 𝐴 (rankgt 𝐴) is the minimum rank of a matrix 𝐵 for which
there exists a single threshold 𝜏 such that for all 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 > 𝜏 if 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 1 and 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 < 𝜏 if 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 0.
Remark 1. This two-sided separation condition may be seen as slightly stronger than requiring,
𝐵𝑖 𝑗 > 𝜏𝑖
if and only if 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 1, however since there are only finitely many elements of 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 we could
always perturb the latter threshold by a sufficient number such that the two-sided condition holds.4
3.2. Theoretical Bounds
For binary matrices, row-wise ordering and row-wise thresholding are equivalent notions of represen-
tational capacity.
Proposition 1. For a binary matrix 𝐴 ∈ {0, 1}
𝑚×𝑛
, we have that rankrop 𝐴 = rankrt 𝐴.
Proof. (≤) Suppose 𝐵 and 𝜏 satisfy the row-wise thresholdable rank condition. Since 𝐴 is a binary
matrix 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 > 𝐴𝑖𝑘 implies 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 1 and 𝐴𝑖𝑘 = 0, thus 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 > 𝜏𝑖 > 𝐵𝑖𝑘, and hence 𝐵 also satisfies the row-wise
order-preserving condition.
(≥) Let 𝐵 satisfy the row-wise order-preserving condition, so 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 > 𝐴𝑖𝑘 implies 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 > 𝐵𝑖𝑘. For each
row 𝑖, let 𝑈𝑖 = {𝐵𝑖 𝑗 | 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 1} and 𝐿𝑖 = {𝐵𝑖 𝑗 | 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 0}. The row-wise order-preserving condition implies
that every element of 𝑈𝑖
is greater than every element of 𝐿𝑖
. We can therefore always find a threshold
𝜏𝑖 separating them (e.g. 𝜏𝑖 = (max 𝐿𝑖 + min𝑈𝑖)/2 if both are non-empty, trivial otherwise). Thus 𝐵 is
also row-wise thresholdable to 𝐴.
The notions we have described so far are closely related to the sign rank of a matrix, which we
use in the rest of the paper to establish our main bounds.
Definition 3 (Sign Rank). The sign rank of a matrix 𝑀 ∈ {−1, 1}
𝑚×𝑛
is the smallest integer 𝑑 such
that there exists a rank 𝑑 matrix 𝐵 ∈ ℝ𝑚×𝑛 whose entries have the same sign as those of 𝑀, i.e.
rank± 𝑀 = min{rank 𝐵 | 𝐵 ∈ ℝ
𝑚×𝑛
such that for all 𝑖, 𝑗 we have sign 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑀𝑖 𝑗}.
In what follows, we use 1𝑛 to denote the 𝑛-dimensional vector of ones, and 1𝑚×𝑛 to denote an
𝑚 × 𝑛 matrix of ones.
Proposition 2. Let 𝐴 ∈ {0, 1}
𝑚×𝑛 be a binary matrix. Then 2𝐴 − 1𝑚×𝑛 ∈ {−1, 1}
𝑚×𝑛
, and we have
rank±(2𝐴 − 1𝑚×𝑛) − 1 ≤ rankrop 𝐴 = rankrt 𝐴 ≤ rankgt 𝐴 ≤ rank±(2𝐴 − 1𝑚×𝑛)
Proof. N.b. the equality was already established in Proposition 1. We prove each inequality separately.
1. rankrt 𝐴 ≤ rankgt 𝐴: True by definition, since any matrix satisfying the globally thresholdable
condition trivially satisfies a row-wise thresholdable condition with the same threshold for each row.
2. rankgt 𝐴 ≤ rank±(2𝐴−1𝑚×𝑛): Let 𝐵 be any matrix whose entries have the same sign as 2𝐴−1𝑚×𝑛
𝐵𝑖 𝑗 > 0 ⇐⇒ 2𝐴𝑖 𝑗 − 1 > 0 ⇐⇒ 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 1.
Thus 𝐵 satisfies the globally thresholdable condition with a threshold of 0.
4
i.e. without loss of generality, we may assume the thresholds in the above definitions are not equal to any elements of
𝐵 since we could increase the threshold of 𝜏 by a sufficiently 𝜖 to preserve the inequality.3. rank±(2𝐴 − 1𝑚×𝑛) − 1 ≤ rankrt 𝐴: Suppose 𝐵 satisfies the row-wise thresholding condition with
minimal rank, so rankrt 𝐴 = rank 𝐵 and there exists 𝜏 ∈ ℝ𝑚 such that 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 > 𝜏𝑖

𝐵𝑖 𝑗 − 𝜏𝑖 < 0 ⇐⇒ 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 0 ⇐⇒ 2𝐴𝑖 𝑗 − 1 < 0. (2)
Thus rank±(2𝐴 − 1𝑚×𝑛) ≤ rank(𝐵 − 𝜏1

Combining these gives the desired chain of inequalities.
3.3. Consequences
In the context of a vector embedding model, this provides a lower and upper bound on the dimension
of vectors required to exactly capture a given set of retrieval objectives, in the sense of row-wise
ordering, row-wise thresholding, or global thresholding. In particular, given some binary relevance
matrix 𝐴 ∈ {0, 1}
𝑚×𝑛
, we need at least rank±(2𝐴 − 1𝑚×𝑛) − 1 dimensions to capture the relationships
in 𝐴 exactly, and can always accomplish this in at most rank±(2𝐴 − 1𝑚×𝑛) dimensions.
Practically, this means:
1. For any fixed dimension 𝑑, there exists a binary relevance matrix which cannot be captured
via 𝑑-dimensional embeddings (as there are matrices with arbitrarily high sign-rank). In other
words, retrieval tasks whose qrel matrices have higher sign-rank are more difficult to capture
exactly for embedding models, requiring higher embedding dimensions.
2. If we are able to embed a given matrix 𝐴 ∈ {0, 1}
𝑚×𝑛
in a row-wise order-preserving manner in
𝑑 dimensions, this implies a bound on the sign rank of 2𝐴 − 1𝑚×𝑛. In particular, this suggests
a practical mechanism for determining an upper-bound on sign-rank for matrices via gradient
descent optimization of free embedding representations.
4. Empirical Connection: Best Case Optimization
We have now established a theoretical limitation of embedding models based on the sign-rank of the
qrel matrix and their embedding dimension 𝑑. Now we seek to show that this empirically as well.
To show the strongest optimization case possible, we design experiments where the vectors
themselves are directly optimizable with gradient descent.5 We call this "free embedding" optimization,
as the embeddings are free to be optimized and not constrained by natural language, which imposes
constraints on any realistic embedding model. Thus, this shows whether it is feasible for any
embedding model to solve this problem: if the free embedding optimization cannot solve the
problem, real retrieval models will not be able to either. It is also worth noting that we do this by
directly optimizing the embeddings over the target qrel matrix (test set). This will not generalize to a
new dataset, but is done to show the highest performance that could possibly occur.
Experimental Settings We create a random document matrix (size 𝑛) and a random query matrix
with top-𝑘 sets (of all combinations, i.e. size 𝑚 =
rank±(2𝐴 − 1𝑚×𝑛) − 1 ≤ rankrt 𝐴: Suppose 𝐵 satisfies the row-wise thresholding condition with
minimal rank, so rankrt 𝐴 = rank 𝐵 and there exists 𝜏 ∈ ℝ𝑚 such that 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 > 𝜏𝑖
if 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 1 and 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 < 𝜏𝑖
if
𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 0. Then the entries of 𝐵 − 𝜏1
𝑇
𝑛 have the same sign as 2𝐴 − 1𝑚×𝑛, since (𝐵 − 𝜏1

)𝑖 𝑗 = 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 − 𝜏𝑖 and
𝐵𝑖 𝑗 − 𝜏𝑖 > 0 ⇐⇒ 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 1 ⇐⇒ 2𝐴𝑖 𝑗 − 1 > 0, and (1)
𝐵𝑖 𝑗 − 𝜏𝑖 < 0 ⇐⇒ 𝐴𝑖 𝑗 = 0 ⇐⇒ 2𝐴𝑖 𝑗 − 1 < 0. (2)
Thus rank±(2𝐴 − 1𝑚×𝑛) ≤ rank(𝐵 − 𝜏1
𝑇

C.1 Sheaf Interpretation
Consider the bipartite incidence relation
R
⊆
Q
×
D
\mathcal{R}\subseteq Q\times D
R
⊆
Q
×
D
with queries
Q
=
{
q
1
,
...
,
q
m
}
Q=\{q_1,\dots,q_m\}
Q
=
{
q
1
​
,
...
,
q
m
​
}
, documents
D
=
{
d
1
,
...
,
d
n
}
D=\{d_1,\dots,d_n\}
D
=
{
d
1
​
,
...
,
d
n
​
}
. We may regard each row of
A
A
A
as defining a
stalk
over
q
i
q_i
q
i
​
, i.e.
F
(
q
i
)
=
{
d
j
∣
A
i
j
=
1
}
.
\mathcal{F}(q_i) = \{\, d_j \mid A_{ij}=1 \,\}.
F
(
q
i
​
)
=
{
d
j
​
∣
A
ij
​
=
1
}
.
These stalks glue along overlaps induced by shared documents. The obstruction highlighted by the rank bounds is precisely that not every such presheaf
F
\mathcal{F}
F
admits a realization in a low-dimensional vector space
V
=
R
d
V=\mathbb{R}^d
V
=
R
d
with dot-product scoring. The low-rank constraint forces certain overlaps to collapse, destroying distinctions between query neighborhoods.
C.2 Homotopy Colimit as Retrieval
Formally, the
semantic infrastructure
is the homotopy colimit
hocolim
⁡
q
i
∈
Q
F
(
q
i
)
,
\operatorname{hocolim}_{q_i\in Q} \mathcal{F}(q_i),
hocolim
q
i
​
∈
Q
​
F
(
q
i
​
)
,
which records how local neighborhoods of relevant docs are glued into a global retrieval structure. A single-vector embedding model corresponds to replacing this hocolim by a factorization through a rank-
d
d
d
bilinear form. The DeepMind sign-rank bounds show that for sufficiently rich overlap patterns, no such factorization exists below dimension exponential in
∣
Q
∣
|Q|
∣
Q
∣
and
∣
D
∣
|D|
∣
D
∣
.
C.3 RSVP Field Analogy
In RSVP terms:
Φ
\Phi
Φ
(scalar density) encodes the
number of distinguishable contexts
. Compression to
R
d
\mathbb{R}^d
R
d
discards scalar capacity when
d
<
signrank
⁡
d < \operatorname{signrank}
d
<
signrank
.
v
⃗
\vec{v}
v
(vector flow) encodes the
routing of relevance
across overlaps. In sheaf terms, these are the transition functions. Rank collapse kills nontrivial flows, forcing contradictory queries into the same channel.
S
S
S
(entropy) is the
obstruction class
: the misalignment between the ideal hocolim of contexts and the actual compressed embedding space.
C.4 Practical Consequence
Thus, the DeepMind bounds can be rephrased:
Any attempt to represent the full sheaf of query-document relationships as a single-vector inner-product system corresponds to forcing the homotopy colimit through a rank-
d
d
d
bottleneck. If the overlap structure of queries has sign-rank greater than
d
d
d
, information is irretrievably lost, and distinct semantic neighborhoods collapse.
This provides a categorical justification for why sparse, multi-vector, or sheaf-based approaches outperform single-vector embeddings on combinatorially rich retrieval tasks: they maintain the
gluing data
rather than collapsing it into a low-rank shadow.

In a dot-product model, each query

{
v

v

​
}
⊂
R

. Row-wise thresholdability says: for each row, there exists a hyperplane that separates the "relevant" docs from the "irrelevant" ones
using the same points
{
v

\{v_j\}
{
v

​
}
.
In
R

\mathbb{R}^2
R

, place four points in general position (no three collinear). It's a standard fact from planar linear separability that
two opposite corners of a convex 4-gon are not linearly separable from the other two
. Equivalently, among all 2-vs-2 labelings of four points in convex position, the
opposite-pair
labelings

\{D_2,D_4\}

not

(Intuition: in the plane, the linearly separable 2-vs-2 splits are exactly those where the two positives form a contiguous arc on the convex hull; opposite corners fail this, and you need a third dimension to pull them apart with different hyperplanes while keeping the same point set.)

In

d=2
d

, forcing a single-vector realization acts like
premature sheafification
: the opposite-pair sections cannot be simultaneously realized, so some overlaps must collapse (the obstruction cannot be represented).
In
d
=
3
d=3
d
=
3
, the tetrahedral construction behaves like a
homotopy colimit
of the local sections: each row gets its own separating hyperplane over a
common

R

This 4×4 example is the smallest nontrivial case where
a fixed set of documents and multiple queries force

low-dimensional, single-vector embeddings collapse nontrivial overlap patterns
; higher-dimensional (or sparse/multivector) representations act like semantic infrastructures that
preserve

5.6. Alternatives to Embedding Models
Our previous results show both theoretically and empirically that embedding models cannot represent
all combinations of documents in their top-𝑘 sets, making them unable to represent and solve some
retrieval tasks. As current embedding models have grown larger (e.g. up to 4096), this has helped
reduce negative effects for smaller dataset sizes. However, with enough combinations of top-𝑘 sets
the dimensionality would have to increase to an infeasible size for non-toy datasets.
Thus, our results show an interesting tradeoff: embeddings can represent a large amount of
combinations but not all combinations. Although they are useful for first stage results to a degree,
more expressive retriever architectures will be needed. We briefly discuss some of these below.
Cross-Encoders Although not suitable for first stage retrieval at scale, they are already typically
used to improve first stage results. However, is LIMIT challenging for rerankers also?
We evaluate a long context reranker, Gemini-2.5-Pro [Comanici et al., 2025] on the small setting
as a comparison. We give Gemini all 46 documents and all 1000 queries at once, asking it to output
the relevant documents for each query with one generation. We find that it can successfully solve
(100%) all 1000 queries in one forward pass. This is in contrast to even the best embedding models
with a recall@2 of less than 60% (Figure 4). Thus we can see that LIMIT is simple for state-of-the-art
reranker models as they do not have the same limitations based on embedding dimension. However,
they still have the limitation of being more computationally expensive than embedding models and
thus cannot be used for first stage retrieval when there are large numbers of documents.
Multi-vector models Multi-vector models are more expressive through the use of multiple vectors
per sequence combined with the MaxSim operator [Khattab and Zaharia, 2020]. These models show
promise on the LIMIT dataset, with scores greatly above the single-vector models despite using a
smaller backbone (ModernBERT, Warner et al. [2024]). However, these models are not generally
used for instruction-following or reasoning-based tasks, leaving it an open question to how well
multi-vector techniques will transfer to these more advanced tasks.
Sparse models Sparse models (both lexical and neural versions) can be thought of as single vector
models but with very high dimensionality. This dimensionality helps BM25 avoid the problems of the
neural embedding models as seen in Figure 3. Since the 𝑑 of their vectors is high, they can scale to
many more combinations than their dense vector counterparts. However, it is less clear how to apply
sparse models to instruction-following and reasoning-based tasks where there is no lexical or even
paraphrase-like overlap. We leave this direction to future work.
6. Conclusion
We introduce the LIMIT dataset, which highlights the fundamental limitations of embedding models.
We provide a theoretical connection that shows that embedding models cannot represent all combina-
tions of top-𝑘 documents until they have a large enough embedding dimension 𝑑. We show these
theoretical results hold empirically as well, through best case optimization of the vectors themselves.
We then make a practical connection to existing state-of-the-art models by creating a simple natural
language instantiation of the theory, called LIMIT, that these models cannot solve. Our results imply
that the community should consider how instruction-based retrieval will impact retrievers, as there
will be combinations of top-𝑘 documents cannot represent.Limitations
Although our experiments provide theoretical insight for the most common type of embedding model
(single vector) they do not hold necessarily for other architectures, such as multi-vector models.
Although we showed initial empirical results with non-single vector models, we leave it to future work
to extend our theoretical connections to these settings.
We also did not show theoretical results for the setting where the user allows some mistakes, e.g.
capturing only the majority of the combinations. We leave putting a bound on this scenario to future
work and would invite the reader to examine works like Ben-David et al. [2002].
We have showed the theoretical connection that proves that some combinations cannot be repre-
sented by embedding models, however, we cannot prove apriori which types of combinations they
will fail on. Thus, it is possible that there are some instruction-following or reasoning tasks they can
solve perfectly, however, we do know that there exists some tasks that they will never be able to solve.

Got it — you want a section that interprets
"Alternatives to Embedding Models"
(cross-encoders, multi-vector, sparse models) but in your RSVP / semantic infrastructure framing, and probably as an appendix or late-section commentary. Here's a draft you could integrate after your mathematical appendix, or as a bridging note before your conclusion:
Appendix F: Beyond Single-Vector Embeddings — RSVP Interpretations
The LIMIT results show that single-vector embeddings collapse once the combinatorial richness of queries exceeds their representational rank. Alternatives such as cross-encoders, multi-vector models, and sparse representations provide different ways of metabolizing this entropy rather than expelling it.
Cross-Encoders as Semantic Reweavers.
Cross-encoders circumvent the dimension bottleneck by recomputing pairwise query-document relations on demand, effectively refusing the compression that embeddings enforce. In RSVP terms, this is akin to dynamically recomputing the vector field
v
⃗
\vec{v}
v
over
Φ
\Phi
Φ
for each query, rather than storing all possible flows in advance. The cost is entropic: energy and computation scale quadratically, making them unsuitable for first-pass retrieval at planetary scale.
Multi-Vector Models as Sheaf Patches.
Multi-vector models (e.g., ColBERT and successors) approximate the behavior of sheaves: instead of collapsing a document into one global section, they preserve multiple local sections that can be glued under MaxSim. This allows finer-grained preservation of overlaps, exactly the obstruction we saw in the 4×4 tetrahedron toy case. In RSVP terms, the field retains local semantic density rather than over-compressing
Φ
\Phi
Φ
, distributing negentropic flow more evenly.
Sparse Models as Infinite-Dimensional Plena.
Sparse methods (BM25, SPLADE, etc.) avoid collapse by working in extremely high-dimensional spaces, effectively taking the embedding dimension
d
→
∞
d\to \infty
d
→
∞
. This guarantees that many combinatorial labelings remain linearly separable, but sacrifices compactness and semantic smoothness. From an RSVP perspective, sparse models preserve raw entropy
S
S
S
rather than metabolizing it, functioning as archives of lexical microstates. They excel where surface structure dominates, but falter in contexts requiring recursive inference or entropic smoothing.
In category-theoretic language:
Single-vector models
enforce a premature colimit: all local sections are glued into one global vector, obliterating nontrivial overlaps.
Multi-vector models
allow a homotopy colimit: overlaps are preserved via multiple representatives.
Cross-encoders
recompute fiber products directly, bypassing the need for global compression.
Sparse models
enlarge the base category until almost any sheaf becomes trivially glueable.
From the RSVP vantage point, none of these is a final solution. Each represents a tradeoff between preserving semantic density (
Φ
\Phi
Φ
), sustaining distributed flows (
v
⃗
\vec{v}
v
), and controlling entropy (
S
S
S
). A true semantic infrastructure would not merely expand
d
d
d
or recompute pairwise scores, but implement recursive entropic balancing—ensuring that compression, expansion, and recomputation remain Lyapunov-stable across scales.

extend this into a worked comparison table
(Single-vector vs Cross-encoder vs Multi-vector vs Sparse, with RSVP fields Φ, v, S columns)? That could make the alternatives section more concrete.

Exact relevance modeling; high recall
Quadratic compute cost; infeasible at scale
Multi-Vector Models
Multiple vectors per document with MaxSim operator
Moderately preserved: local patches kept
Flow distributed across multiple channels
Obstructions tracked in overlaps
Homotopy colimit (gluing with overlaps preserved)
Finer granularity; balances compactness and fidelity
Still bounded in dimension; less tested for reasoning tasks
Sparse Models (BM25, SPLADE)
High-dimensional sparse lexical vectors
Preserves raw lexical microstates
Flow distributed but shallow; no entropic smoothing
Stores entropy rather than metabolizing it
Infinite-dimensional limit (sheaf becomes trivially glueable)
Strong performance on keyword/logical queries
Weak for reasoning/instruction-following; less semantic generalization
This table makes clear that each architecture corresponds to a different
semantic infrastructure strategy
:
Single-vector
→ premature compression.
Cross-encoders
→ recomputation at the cost of energy.
Multi-vector
→ local sections glued with preserved overlaps.
Sparse
→ entropy archival in infinite dimensions.
A genuine RSVP retrieval model would likely combine elements of all four: local section preservation (multi-vector), scalable compression (single-vector), dynamic recomputation when necessary (cross-encoder), and archival access (sparse), orchestrated under an entropy-aware balancing principle.
Would you like me to sketch how such an
RSVP retrieval model
could be mathematically formalized (e.g., as a functor with adaptive colimits that decide between compression, recomputation, or expansion depending on entropy thresholds)?

7. Towards RSVP Retrieval: Adaptive Colimits for Semantic Infrastructure
The findings of Weller et al. (2025) on the inherent limits of single-vector embeddings provide an important boundary condition for the design of future retrieval systems. If embeddings necessarily collapse complex query-document relations into an underdetermined space, then the architecture of retrieval must move beyond uniform compression. In this section, we sketch an alternative retrieval paradigm inspired by the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework and its emphasis on entropy-aware semantic infrastructure.
7.1 Embeddings as Premature Colimits
Single-vector embedding models can be understood as enforcing a premature global section of the sheaf of query-document relations. By mapping entire contexts into a single
R
d
\mathbb{R}^d
R
d
vector, they collapse obstruction classes that would otherwise indicate incompatible or overlapping local structures. This premature colimit is efficient but brittle: contradictions are erased rather than metabolized, leading to the combinatorial failures exposed by the LIMIT dataset.
7.2 RSVP Fields as Control Variables
RSVP provides a natural language to diagnose this collapse.
Φ
\Phi
Φ
(semantic density):
overly compressed when reduced to a single embedding vector.
v
⃗
\vec v
v
(vector flow):
bottlenecked into one similarity channel, losing the ability to differentiate trajectories of meaning.
S
S
S
(entropy/obstruction):
expelled as noise or error rather than incorporated into the retrieval process.
In practice, single-vector embeddings enforce low entropy by construction, but at the cost of suppressing the richness of possible relevance relations.
7.3 Adaptive Colimits as Retrieval Strategy
We propose that retrieval should instead be modeled as an
adaptive colimit
across multiple retrieval architectures. For each query context, the system measures the
obstruction load
—the degree to which low-rank embeddings fail to preserve local consistency—and then escalates retrieval fidelity only as needed.
If obstruction is low, single-vector methods suffice.
If moderate, multi-vector or sparse methods preserve local overlaps.
If high, cross-encoder recomputation is selectively applied to the offending regions.
Formally, the retrieval output becomes a homotopy colimit of partial results, weighted by a controller
π
\pi
π
that balances retrieval accuracy, computational cost, and entropy preservation. This ensures that local contradictions are either maintained (via sparse/multi-vector structures) or explicitly rewoven (via cross-encoders), rather than being silently erased.
7.4 Semantic Infrastructure Perspective
This strategy exemplifies what we mean by
semantic infrastructure
: retrieval systems designed not only to deliver results but also to maintain the structural integrity of meaning across scales. By treating obstructions as signals rather than errors, an RSVP retrieval model metabolizes semantic entropy into adaptive routing policies. In categorical terms, it resists premature global sections and instead organizes retrieval as a dynamic balance between compression, preservation, and recomputation.
7.5 Implications
Such an approach reframes the role of retrieval models within chokepoint capitalism. Instead of reinforcing centralization through rigid embeddings that collapse diversity into proprietary bottlenecks, RSVP retrieval enables plural and adaptive infrastructures. In effect, it builds in a resistance to semantic capture: value is not solely concentrated at the compression layer but distributed across a spectrum of retrieval modalities.
Would you like me to also draft a
figure caption-style diagram description
(in prose, not visuals, since you prefer no diagrams) that walks the reader through how this adaptive routing works step by step? That could make the section more tangible without requiring an actual chart.

that could sit either inside the section or as a note below it, making the adaptive colimit idea more tangible without resorting to graphics:
Figure (conceptual): RSVP Adaptive Retrieval Workflow.
Imagine a query enters the system. In the first pass, it is routed through a
single-vector embedding model
, producing a cheap, compressed retrieval list. At this point, the system measures the
obstruction load
—a proxy for how much semantic contradiction or overlap has been lost in compression. If the obstruction is
low
, the system stops here, returning results quickly. If the obstruction is
moderate
, the system activates a
multi-vector or sparse model
, which distributes meaning across multiple channels or dimensions to recover overlaps. If the obstruction is
high
, the system escalates selectively to a
cross-encoder
, which recomputes exact pairwise relevance on only the ambiguous slice of documents. The outputs from these heterogeneous routes are then "glued" together via a
homotopy colimit
, ensuring that local consistency conditions are respected and contradictions are either preserved (as overlaps) or explicitly resolved. The end result is a retrieval output that adapts its semantic fidelity to the demands of the query, rather than erasing complexity by default.
Would you like me to also prepare a
short boxed "algorithm" pseudocode
version, something that reads like an outline of steps 1-5, so readers who think procedurally can immediately see how the system executes?

Here's a
worked miniature example
that brings the pseudocode to life. It shows how the routing thresholds decide whether to stay with single-vector, escalate to multi-vector/sparse, or invoke a cross-encoder.
Example: 3 Queries × 4 Documents
Suppose we have four documents

​

​
: "Sorting with heaps"
Now consider three queries:
Q1
: "Find all dynamic programming tasks"
Q2
: "Find problems that use both DP and graph search"
Q3
: "Find problems that share structure across alternating subtasks"
Step 1: Initial pass (single-vector)
The embedding model retrieves:
Q1 → {D1, D3} (correct, low obstruction)
Q2 → {D1, D2, D3} (ambiguous: D2 not really relevant, some collapse)
Q3 → {D1, D2, D3, D4} (completely blurred, cannot separate alternating structure).
Step 2: Estimate obstruction load
Q1
: Low
S

\widehat S
S

Q2
: Moderate
S
^
\widehat S
S
(confusion between DP vs greedy).
Q3
: High
S
^
\widehat S
S
(no clean separation, resembles LIMIT-style combinatorial overlap).
Step 3: Routing
Q1
: Obstruction low → stay with
single-vector
output.
Q2
: Moderate → escalate to
multi-vector
, preserving local semantic patches. This separates {D1, D3} from {D2}.
Q3
: High → route to
cross-encoder
on ambiguous subset {D1-D4}, recomputing pairwise query-doc scores to recover correct alternating structure.
Step 4: Adaptive colimit gluing
Merge outputs:
From single-vector (Q1).
From multi-vector refinement (Q2).
From cross-encoder recomputation (Q3).
The homotopy colimit ensures overlaps are consistent across queries (e.g., D1 appears in both Q1 and Q2, but only in the right role).
Result:
Q1 → {D1, D3}
Q2 → {D1, D3} (no spurious D2)
Q3 → {D2, D4} (correct alternating subtasks)
This toy example dramatizes the
adaptive colimit principle
: keep things cheap if possible, but escalate only when obstruction demands it.
