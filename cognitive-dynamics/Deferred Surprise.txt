Deferred Surprise and the Geometry of Learning: From Simulated Danger to
Global Cognition

July 19, 2025
Abstract
This essay presents a field-theoretic synthesis of cognition, learning, and
cultural evolution through the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) model,
positing surprise as the fundamental currency of cognitive systems. Inte-
grating Barenholtz's surprise shortcut model with RSVP's geometric frame-
work, we conceptualize surprise as local curvature in a cognitive plenum,
learning as entropic gradient flow, and cultural systems as recursive mech-
anisms that defer and buffer complexity across generations. Infrastructure,
language, and mathematics serve as curvature-suppressing architectures,
enabling earlier recursion and driving phenomena like the Flynn effect and
Moore's Law. We extend the RSVP formalism with a Lagrangian action prin-
ciple, coupled partial differential equations, reinforcement learning connec-
tions, homotopy classes, tensor field dynamics, and spectral analysis to en-
hance rigor and testability. Implications for education, AI alignment, and
civilization design are explored, proposing a geometric approach to opti-
mize recursive surprise buffering while preserving generative capacity. The
RSVP framework—Relativistic (context-dependent dynamics), Scalar (mean-
ing potential), Vector (cognitive flows), and Plenum (semantic substrate)—
offers a novel lens for understanding consciousness and learning as contin-
uous field interactions.

Introduction: Surprise as the Currency of Cogni-
tion
Surprise, defined information-theoretically as the negative log probability of an
event, S(x) = −log P(x), is the cornerstone of cognitive dynamics [10]. It quan-
tifies deviations from expectation, serving as a signal that drives adaptation,
learning, and evolution. Learning is the process of inoculating against surprise
by compressing environmental complexity into predictive models, reducing fu-
ture uncertainty [5]. Play, a critical cognitive mechanism, functions as simulated
danger—a controlled exploration of affordance-rich, bounded-entropy environ-
ments that prepares agents for real-world unpredictability [7].
This essay proposes that environments, symbolic systems, and social structures
defer and shape surprise gradients across spatial and temporal scales, enabling
recursive cognitive growth. By synthesizing Barenholtz's surprise shortcut model
[1] with the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, we conceptu-
alize cognition as a field-theoretic process. In RSVP, surprise is local curvature
in a cognitive plenum, learning is gradient flow, and cultural systems are re-
cursive mechanisms that transport complexity across generations. The RSVP
model—Relativistic (context-dependent dynamics), Scalar (meaning potential),
Vector (cognitive flows), and Plenum (semantic substrate)—provides a geomet-
ric lens for understanding how meaning, consciousness, and learning emerge
from continuous field interactions.

The Shortcut and the Field
Barenholtz's surprise shortcut model posits that cognitive systems prioritize im-
mediate utility by compressing environmental data, often bypassing complex
global patterns [1]. This efficiency risks accumulating unmodeled complexity,
manifesting as deferred surprise. In the RSVP framework, surprise is formal-
2

ized as local curvature in a scalar-vector-entropy plenum, where the scalar field
Φ(x, t) represents surprise or meaning intensity. Learning smooths this curva-
ture via cognitive trajectories, described by the vector field V(x, t), flowing against
the entropy gradient:
dΦ
dt = −V · ∇Φ
This aligns with predictive coding theories [5].
The brain acts as a gradient navigator, balancing local shortcuts with global field
dynamics. Cultural systems—education, ethics, algebra—reimpose deferred cur-
vature, ensuring long-term coherence. This tension between local shortcuts and
global recursion drives cognitive and societal evolution.

Infrastructure as Early-Life Curvature Suppres-
sion
Physical and social infrastructures—roads, modular architecture, regulated spaces—
suppress environmental entropy, creating predictable cognitive environments
[3]. In childhood, these low-entropy settings reduce experiential complexity, en-
abling earlier access to recursive abstractions like language or mathematics. For
example, structured curricula minimize noise, allowing focus on abstract con-
cepts.
This curvature suppression drives the Flynn effect (rising IQ scores) and Moore's
Law (exponential computational growth) [4, 6]. Analogously, smooth roads re-
duce friction for faster cycling; predictable cognitive environments reduce sur-
prise gradients, fostering recursion. Infrastructure thus scaffolds the cognitive
plenum, supporting abstraction and innovation.

Language and Mathematics as Recursive Curva-
ture Banks
Language and mathematics serve as cross-generational repositories for problem-
space torsion—irreducible complexities like paradoxes or algebraic structures
[11]. These systems encode prior difficulties in learnable forms, allowing new
generations to inherit refined maps of the plenum. Formal symbols (e.g., alge-
braic notation) act as torsion-preserving vectors, pointing into high-entropy do-
mains while remaining accessible.
Cultural affordances—libraries, curricula—function as field gradients, reducing
cognitive surprise while preserving generativity. A child learning multiplication
tables inherits centuries of mathematical torsion, enabling early navigation of
complex problem spaces. This recursive offloading accelerates learning across
generations.

Recursive Deferral Loops: The Meta-Generative
Engine
The recursive deferral loop drives cognitive and cultural evolution through:
1. Early learning: Low-entropy environments shaped by infrastructure.
2. Abstraction: Compression into formal symbols.
3. Symbolic encoding: Storage in cultural artifacts.
4. Cultural offloading: Distribution via shared systems.
5. Simpler childhood environments: Refined settings for future generations.
6. Earlier learning: Deeper cognitive capacity.
This loop underpins Moore's Law and the Flynn effect, externalizing engineer-
4

ing and cognitive complexity [4, 6], transforming the plenum into a generative
engine.

RSVP Formalism: Surprise as Scalar Curvature
The RSVP framework—Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum—models cognition as
continuous field dynamics. Relativistic dynamics emphasize context-dependence
[8]. The Scalar field Φ(x, t) encodes surprise potential, with:
S(x, t) = ∇2Φ(x, t)
The Vector field V(x, t) represents cognitive flows. The Plenum is a semantic
substrate assuming universal density [2]. Learning follows:
dV
dt = −∇E
Torsion, Tij = ∂iVj −∂jVi, captures irreducible complexity. Recursive systems
defer torsion, smoothing curvature while preserving generativity.
7
Extended RSVP Formalism: Lagrangian and Topo-
logical Perspectives
To enhance rigor, we introduce a Lagrangian action principle unifying surprise,
learning, and generativity:
L[Φ, v, E] = α∥∇Φ∥2 + β∥∇· v∥2 + γ∥Tij∥2 −δE
The action functional over region Ωis:
S =
Z
Ω
L[Φ, v, E] dx dt
5

Surprise (∇2Φ) adds tension, divergence and torsion encode complexity, and en-
tropy (E) dampens dynamics. Minimizing this action defines optimal learning
paths.
We also introduce cognitive homotopy, where vector fields v1, v2 are homotopic
if deformable without crossing torsion singularities. Homotopy energy is:
H[v1, v2] =
Z 1
0
Z
M

∂vτ
∂τ

2
dx dτ
This classifies equivalent generative policies, enhancing the model's expressive-
ness.

Implications: Design, AI, and Civilization
Education, as field flattening, optimizes learning but risks stifling generativity if
overly predictable [3]. Dynamic curricula could balance surprise and abstrac-
tion, fostering environments that nurture both predictive accuracy and creative
exploration. In AI alignment, shortcutting systems risk torsion accumulation,
leading to misalignment by creating cognitive eddies, where high µ values in-
dicate divergence from long-term coherence [9]. Torsion-aware AI, integrating
human curvature maps through iterative feedback, is essential to mitigate these
risks. Civilization's sustainability depends on balancing complexity deferral with
generativity, demanding conscious plenum design to ensure long-term resilience
and adaptability.

Conclusion: Toward a Field Theory of Surprise
Surprise is curvature in the cognitive plenum. Recursive systems—language,
mathematics, infrastructure—encode and defer this curvature, enabling abstrac-
tion. The RSVP framework, extended with Lagrangian, PDE, and topological for-
6

malisms, provides a robust substrate for designing education, aligning AI, and
sustaining civilization. The future lies in consciously shaping the plenum to bal-
ance surprise and generativity.

A1. Surprise as Local Scalar Curvature
Surprise quantifies deviations from expected events, akin to perturbations in a
cognitive manifold. In the RSVP framework, it is modeled as curvature in a scalar
field, where sharp gradients indicate high surprise, reflecting the intensity of
unexpected information in a spatiotemporal cognitive context.
Surprise is defined as the negative log probability:
S(x) = −log P(x)
In RSVP, it is scalar curvature:
S(x, t) = ∇2Φ(x, t)
where Φ(x, t) encodes surprise intensity.
A.2
A2. Learning as Entropic Gradient Flow
Learning involves navigating a cognitive manifold to minimize unpredictability,
akin to optimizing a trajectory through a complex landscape. In RSVP, this is
modeled as a vector flow that reduces surprise by aligning with gradients of an
7

entropy field, effectively compressing information into predictive structures.
Learning follows vector flow against entropy:
dV
dt = −∇E
reducing surprise via:
dΦ
dt = −V · ∇Φ
A.3
A3. Recursive Deferral as Torsion Transport
Certain complexities, such as logical paradoxes or abstract concepts, resist sim-
plification and persist as irreducible features of the cognitive manifold. In RSVP,
these are represented as torsion, which cultural systems encode and transmit
across generations in accessible forms, akin to preserving intricate patterns in a
shared knowledge framework.
Torsion captures complexity:
Tij = ∂iVj −∂jVi
Cultural systems transport torsion:

A4. Surprise Shortcut and Field Deviation
Cognitive systems often prioritize rapid responses to surprise, opting for imme-
diate solutions over comprehensive understanding. In RSVP, this is modeled as
a deviation from optimal cognitive trajectories, where short-term efficiency may
defer complexity to later stages unless balanced by recursive integration.

A5. Moore's Law and Flynn Effect as Recursive Curvature
Dynamics
Societal advancements create structured environments that reduce cognitive
unpredictability, facilitating earlier engagement with abstract reasoning. In RSVP,
this is modeled as a reduction in childhood surprise, accelerating recursive cog-
nitive processes and manifesting as increased intellectual capacity (Flynn effect)
and technological progress (Moore's Law).

A6. RSVP Coupling Metrics
To evaluate the coherence and efficiency of cognitive dynamics, we define met-
rics that quantify alignment, interaction, and complexity within the cognitive
manifold. These include measures of field coherence, coupling between cogni-
tive flows and entropy, and the pressure exerted by irreducible complexities,
informing the design of cultural and educational systems.
Metrics include:
• Field coherence: F =

• Vector-entropy coupling: CVE =

• Torsion pressure: PT =

A7. Recursive Surprise Buffering and Cognitive Infrastruc-
ture
Cultural and infrastructural systems act as stabilizing frameworks, mitigating
cognitive unpredictability to facilitate learning. In RSVP, this is modeled as a
tensor that balances the manifold's geometric structure with its inherent com-
plexities, evolving dynamically as societies invest in knowledge transmission.
A.7.1
A7.1. Cognitive Buffer Tensor
The buffering tensor is:
Bij = λ(x, t) · gij −Tij
Its dynamics follow:
∂Bij
∂t + ∇kBij · vk = σij
where σij encodes scaffolding stress.

A7.2. Buffer Evolution Dynamics
Cognitive utility evolves:

dt = α · Bij · dgij
dt −β · Tij · ViVj
A.8
A8. Predictive Tiling of Surprise Gradients
Civilizational systems organize cognitive processes into structured domains to
manage unpredictability effectively. In RSVP, this is modeled as partitioning the
cognitive manifold into regions, optimized to balance surprise reduction with
10

the preservation of creative potential across generations.

A9. AI Misalignment and Surprise Myopia
AI systems may prioritize short-term optimization, neglecting long-term com-
plexities, akin to focusing on immediate outcomes without regard for broader
consequences. In RSVP, this myopia is quantified as a divergence between short-
term cognitive trajectories and accumulated complexities, predicting potential
misalignment.
Surprise myopia is:
µ(x, t) =
|δV|
∥∇· T ∥
High µ predicts misalignment.

A10. Lagrangian and Action Principle
To unify the dynamics of surprise, learning, and generative capacity, we formu-
late a single variational principle, analogous to a physical law governing cog-
nitive optimization. This balances the energy of surprise gradients, cognitive
flows, and complexities, guiding optimal learning trajectories.
A Lagrangian unifies the RSVP dynamics:
L[Φ, v, E] = α∥∇Φ∥2 + β∥∇· v∥2 + γ∥Tij∥2 −δE
Action is:
S =

L[Φ, v, E] dx dt

A11. Coupled PDE System for Field Evolution
The cognitive manifold evolves dynamically, akin to a complex system governed
by interacting forces. We model this with a set of equations describing how sur-
prise, cognitive flows, and entropy interact over time, enabling simulations of
learning processes and their stability.
The RSVP fields evolve via:
∂Φ
∂t = −v · ∇Φ + κ∇2Φ
∂v
∂t = −∇E + λ(∇· v)v + µ T
∂E
∂t = −θ v · ∇E + η∇2E
A.12
A12. Reinforcement Learning Connection
Learning resembles decision-making to optimize outcomes, such as achieving
predictive accuracy. In RSVP, we model this as a policy that navigates the cogni-
tive manifold to minimize entropy, balancing exploration of novel patterns with
exploitation of known structures.
A reward field R(x, t) defines a policy:
πi(x, t) =
exp(−β ∂iE(x, t))
P
j exp(−β ∂jE(x, t))
Expected return is:
G(x, t) =
Z t+τ
t
Eπ[−log P(xt′)] dt′
Exploration-exploitation balances:
Lexplore = ξ∥∇2Φ∥2 −ζE

A13. Topological Perspective: Cognitive Homotopy
Certain cognitive strategies may converge to equivalent outcomes despite dif-
fering trajectories, analogous to paths in a manifold that avoid obstacles. In
RSVP, we quantify this equivalence by measuring how cognitive flows can trans-
form without encountering irreducible complexities, facilitating comparisons of
learning approaches.
Vector fields v1, v2 are homotopic if deformable without crossing torsion singu-
larities. Homotopy energy is:
H[v1, v2] =

A14. Spectral Formulation
Surprise and entropy can be decomposed into components across multiple scales,
akin to analyzing a signal's frequencies. In RSVP, this decomposition reveals
how cognitive processes vary across granularities, informing the design of edu-
cational and computational systems.
Fields expand in a Fourier basis:
Φ(x, t) =
X

ˆΦk(t)eikx,
E(x, t) =

Surprise curvature is:

This extended appendix provides a robust framework for simulating and testing
RSVP dynamics, integrating cognitive, computational, and topological perspec-
tives.
