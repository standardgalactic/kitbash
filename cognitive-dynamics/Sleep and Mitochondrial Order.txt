Sleep, Central Pattern Generators, and the Mitochondrial
Imperative: A Unified Framework
July 2025
Abstract
We propose a unifying model in which sleep paralysis and the sleep-wake transition are governed
by the partial or failed reactivation of evolutionarily conserved central pattern generators (CPGs),
derived from primitive swimming motions, coupled with mitochondrial recovery dynamics. Within
the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, sleep is interpreted as a desynchronization
of binocular and proprioceptive pulses, with waking as the reentrainment of high-order locomotor
rhythms built upon a foundational aquatic waveform. A mathematical model captures this process
as a transition across symmetry-broken projections of a generalized scalar field (Φ), with coupled
vector dynamics (⃗v) and entropy fields (S). The model integrates mitochondrial ATP recovery and
oxidative stress, providing predictive insight into sleep paralysis, jaw clenching, eye saccades, and
the bootstrapping of complex motor coordination during waking.

Introduction
Sleep paralysis, a phenomenon historically shrouded in mystery, offers a unique window into the layered
architecture of motor control and consciousness. We propose that sleep paralysis is not a pathologi-
cal anomaly but a snapshot of interrupted re-synchronization of ancestral motor schemas embedded in
the nervous system. Our core hypothesis posits that running, brachiating, and flying are evolutionary
variants of swimming, and waking involves bootloading a distributed, swinging, swimming motor pro-
gram via intermodular CPG entrainment. This process is coupled to a mitochondrial imperative, where
sleep facilitates metabolic recovery through systemic stillness. Recent findings (Nature, 2025) under-
score the role of mitochondrial dynamics in sleep, motivating a unified framework that integrates motor
coordination, metabolic repair, and consciousness transitions.

Evolutionary and Neurophysiological Foundations
Primitive vertebrate movement, as observed in lampreys and fish, is governed by sinusoidal spinal CPGs.
These oscillatory circuits are conserved across mammals and birds, adapted for walking, flying, and
brachiating. During REM sleep, these patterns are reactivated without motor output due to glycinergic
and GABAergic inhibition. The vestibulo-ocular system, jaw tension, neck flexion, and proprioceptive
pulses contribute to coordinating these entrained fields, with disruptions manifesting as sleep paralysis
or delayed waking.

RSVP Field Framing
Within the RSVP framework, motor schemas are modeled as vector and scalar field structures defined
over a body-space manifold. We define:
• Φ(x, t): Scalar CPG phase field representing primitive oscillation.
• ⃗v(x, t): Motor vector flow field governing muscle activation and limb torque.
• S(x, t): Entropy/damping field capturing inhibition or loss of coherence.

Symmetry-breaking projections of Φ yield specific locomotor modes (e.g., swim →run, fly, swing). Sleep
paralysis is characterized by high internal coherence in Φ without active coherence in ⃗v, reflecting motor
suppression.

Sleep-Wake Transitions as Field Recoherence
Waking requires entraining the vector field ⃗v with the re-emergent scalar wave Φ. A reflex set Ri (jaw
clench, eye saccade, vestibular flicks, spinal twist) serves as "bootloaders," coupling into the governing
partial differential equation (PDE):
∂tΦ + ⃗v · ∇Φ = D∇2Φ +
∑
i
κiRi(t, x) −γS(x, t)
Where:
• D: Diffusion coeﬀicient.
• κi: Reflex-specific gain.
• Ri(t, x): Temporally pulsed reactivation terms.

Jaw Clenching and Eye Saccades as Anchors
Jaw clenching anchors midline torque, reestablishing equilibrium in ⃗v. Eye saccades, tightly coupled
to locomotor phases, maintain binocular phase synchrony; disruptions trigger desynchronization. The
vestibular system provides rotational inertia and accelerative cues, aiding vector realignment.
6
The Mitochondrial Recovery Imperative
Sleep facilitates mitochondrial recovery through mitophagy, ATP replenishment, and reduction of reac-
tive oxygen species (ROS). Extended wakefulness leads to ATP surplus and electron leak, necessitating
cyclic stillness to restore oxidative respiration eﬀiciency. This metabolic imperative drives the desyn-
chronization of CPGs, enabling systemic stillness as a reparative phase.
7
Unifying Motor and Metabolic Theories of Sleep
Jaw clenching, eye saccades, and CPG rhythms act as "heartbeats" that reentrain motor and metabolic
systems during waking. Sleep serves as both an energetic and informational reconfiguration, with im-
plications for movement disorders, sleep paralysis, and circadian fatigue. The RSVP framework unifies
these processes by modeling sleep as a coordinated system collapse and waking as a re-synchronized
ascent.
8
Prediction and Experimental Proposal
We predict that fMRI and electromyography (EMG) will reveal differential activation in brainstem, jaw,
and eye control circuits during transitions from sleep paralysis to wakefulness. Electrical stimulation of
jaw muscles or induced micro-saccades may accelerate waking. Disorders like narcolepsy or parasomnias
should exhibit aberrations in Φ-⃗v coupling, testable via metabolic imaging or EEG.

Conclusion
Sleep paralysis is not a glitch but a snapshot of an interrupted orchestra, where the scalar conductor
(Φ) has begun, but the vector players (⃗v) remain silent. The RSVP framework offers a topological and
dynamic interpretation, bridging evolutionary biomechanics, mitochondrial dynamics, and consciousness
studies. This model suggests novel physiological tests and therapeutic interventions for sleep-related
disorders.

A
Mathematical Formalism for RSVP-Coupled Sleep Dynamics
This appendix formalizes the model of sleep-wake transitions and sleep paralysis as emergent phenomena
from coupled CPGs, metabolic fatigue, and mitochondrial repair imperatives.
A.1
Definitions and Fields
We define the following fields over a body-space manifold:
• Ci(t): Phase of the i-th CPG oscillator.
• Φ(x, t): Scalar metabolic fatigue potential.
• ⃗v(x, t): Effective motility vector field.
• S(x, t): Entropy or disorder in CPG coordination.
• I(x, t): Neural inhibition field (REM-specific motor suppression).
• Ri(x, t): Reflex bootloader impulse (e.g., jaw clench, eye saccade).
A.2
Phase Dynamics of Coupled CPGs
Each CPG chain is modeled as a noisy phase oscillator with coupling:
dCi
dt = −γ
∑
j̸=i
sin(Ci −Cj) −∂V
∂Ci
+ ηi(t)
Where:
• γ: Coupling strength (e.g., spinal coherence).
• V : Attractor potential (see Section A.4).
• ηi(t): Gaussian white noise modeling sensory perturbations.
A.3
Metabolic Field Equation with Biophysical Terms
The metabolic fatigue field incorporates ATP depletion, ROS buildup, and recovery:
∂Φ
∂t = D∇2Φ −α|∇⃗v|2 + βS −µρΦ2 + ν · ATPrec(t)
Where:
• ρΦ2: ROS production scaling with energetic load.
• ATPrec(t) =
νmax
1+e−k(t−trec) : Logistic recovery profile.
• µ, ν, α, β: Coupling constants.
• S: Phase disorder term.
A.4
REM/NREM/Wake Attractor Landscape
An energy potential defines stable states for REM, NREM, and wakefulness:
V (C, Φ) =
∑
i
k
2(Ci −Ceq
i )2 + a(Φ −ΦREM)2(Φ −ΦNREM)2(Φ −Φwake)2
Where:
• Ceq
i : Equilibrium phase per state (e.g., desynchronized for REM, synchronized for wake).
• ΦREM, ΦNREM, Φwake: Metabolic potentials for each state.
• k, a: Coeﬀicients shaping landscape depth.
This tri-stable polynomial admits three attractors with noise-mediated transitions.

A.5
Vector Field and Inhibitory Suppression
Motility is modulated by fatigue and REM-specific inhibition:
⃗v(x, t) = χ∇Φ + λ∇× ⃗A −κI(x, t) · ⃗v
Where:
• ⃗A: Latent field coupling oscillators across joints.
• I(x, t) = I0e−γinht · Θ(Φ −Φth): Inhibition active below fatigue threshold.
• χ, λ, κ: Coupling constants.
A.6
Reflex Bootloaders (Sigmoid-Gated)
Reflexes are modeled as delta pulses gated by sigmoid switches:
Ri(x, t) = Ai ·
1
1 + e−(Φ−Φth)/ϵ · e−(t−ti)2
2σ2
δ(x −xi)
Each pulse restores local coherence to Φ or boosts ⃗v.
A.7
Sleep Trigger Functional
Systemic collapse into sleep occurs when:
S(t) =
∫
Ω
[∑
i
| ˙Ci|2 + |∇Φ|2 + λS2 ·
1
1 + e−(S−Sth)/ϵ
]
dx
If S(t) > Scrit, reflexes are inhibited, and motility freezes.
B
Simulation and RSVP-TARTAN Embedding (Preview)
In the RSVP framework, the system can be visualized as:
• Phase Portraits: Attractor basins in C-Φ space.
• Tissue Maps: Metabolic fields (Φ), inhibition overlays (I), and reflex vectors (Ri) on body-surface
domains.
• Sleep Transition Visualization: Heat maps and pulse animations of Ri to simulate how jaw clench,
eye saccade, or spinal recoil shifts system state.
Numerical simulations (e.g., finite difference methods) can discretize the PDEs for implementation in
RSVP-TARTAN, enabling dynamic visualization of sleep-wake transitions.
