Abstract
Intelligence emerges not solely from neural computation but from re-
cursive semantic compression and entropy reduction induced by linguis-
tic, architectural, social, and technological scaffolding. Using the Relativistic
Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, we model these as structured de-
formations of a cognitive manifold, with implications for cognitive science,
artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and cultural evolution.

Introduction
The central question of this paper is: What makes intelligence efficient and scal-
able in humans? Traditional neurocentric views of intelligence, which empha-
size internal neural computation, are limited in capturing the distributed and
culturally scaffolded nature of cognition. We introduce the Relativistic Scalar
Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory, a field-based model governed by partial differen-
tial equations (PDEs), to propose that intelligence arises through semantic recur-
sion acting as entropic smoothing on a structured cognitive manifold.
This paper develops a multilayer model comprising four key scaffolding lay-
ers:
• L1: Language
• L2: Built Environment
• L3: Social Norms
• L4: Technological Interfaces
These layers collectively reduce cognitive entropy and enhance efficient naviga-
tion of the cognitive manifold.

Mathematical Foundations of RSVP Cognition
2.1
The RSVP Field Triplet
The RSVP framework defines intelligence through three interrelated fields:
1

• Scalar field Φ: Represents the semantic potential landscape.
• Vector field ⃗v: Represents directed attention or semantic flow.
• Entropy field S: Represents local uncertainty or informational complexity.
2.2
Dynamic Equations
The dynamics of these fields are governed by the following PDEs:
∂tΦ = −∇· ⃗v + α1∆Φ + f(Φ,⃗v, S),
(1)
∂t⃗v = −∇Φ + α2∇× (∇× ⃗v) + g(Φ,⃗v, S),
(2)
∂tS = −⃗v · ∇S + α3∆S + h(Φ,⃗v),
(3)
where α1, α2, α3 are diffusion coefficients, and f, g, h are nonlinear interaction
terms.
2.3
Intelligence as Manifold Traversal
Intelligence I is formalized as efficient navigation of the cognitive manifold M
under bounded sensory input:
I =
∫
Ω⊂M
[−∇S(x) + λ1 · ∇· ⃗v + λ2 · ∆Φ] dx,
(4)
where λ1, λ2 are weighting parameters, and Ωis a subset of the manifold.

Semantic Labels as Recursive Compression Oper-
ators
3.1
Conceptual Role of Labels
Words and concepts act as semantic operators that compress experience into
manageable units. Each label ℓinduces a local deformation of the cognitive man-
ifold.
3.2
Field-Theoretic Effects of Labels
The effect of a label ℓon the RSVP fields is given by:
δℓΦ = −β1 · χ(ℓ),
(5)
δℓ⃗v = β2 · ∇ℓΦ,
(6)
δℓS = −β3 · |∇Φ|2 · Θ(ℓ),
(7)
where χ(ℓ) is a characteristic function of the label, Θ(ℓ) represents context affor-
dance spread, and β1, β2, β3 are scaling coefficients.

Layered Entropic Smoothing Operators
We introduce recursive field-deforming operators Rk across four cultural layers,
each reducing cognitive entropy.
4.1
Layer 1: Language and Symbolic Recursion (L1)
Language acts as an entropy-reducing symbolic attractor set, with recursive reuse
of compressed labels enabling efficient semantic traversal:
R1(Φ) = Φ −
∑
i
χ(ℓi),
(8)
R1(⃗v) = ⃗v +
∑
i
∇χ(ℓi),
(9)
R1(S) = S −γ1
∑
i
|∇χ(ℓi)|2,
(10)
where γ1 controls the strength of entropy reduction.
4.2
Layer 2: Built Environment (L2)
The built environment compresses spatial affordances, simplifying perceptual
search and action planning:
R2(⃗v) = ⃗v ⊙A,
(11)
R2(S) = S −γ2 · divergence suppression,
(12)
where A is a structural affordance tensor, and γ2 modulates spatial entropy re-
duction.
4.3
Layer 3: Social Norms and Institutional Roles (L3)
Social norms and roles reduce interpersonal entropy by providing distributed
priors for agent prediction and alignment:
R3(Φ) = Φ + Vnorm(x, t),
(13)
R3(S) = S −γ3 · role consistency,
(14)
where Vnorm encodes normative potentials, and γ3 reflects social coherence.
4.4
Layer 4: Technological Interfaces (L4)
Technological interfaces project high-dimensional action spaces into low-entropy
semantic forms:
R4(Φ) = Φ −δ · GUIpotential,
(15)
R4(⃗v) = π(⃗v),
(16)
R4(S) = S −γ4 · control-efficiency,
(17)
where π is a projection operator, and γ4 quantifies interface efficiency.

The Entropy Smoothing Stack (ESS)
5.1
Hierarchical View
Each layer builds upon the previous, with intelligence emerging as cumulative
entropy smoothing across the stacked recursion layers.
5.2
Formal ESS Model
The composite smoothing operator is defined as:
RESS = R4 ◦R3 ◦R2 ◦R1.
(18)
The intelligence functional under ESS is:
IESS =
∫
M
RESS (−∇S + λ1∇· ⃗v + λ2∆Φ) .
(19)

Extensions and Applications
6.1
Neurocognitive Mapping
The RSVP framework maps to neural fields: Φ as error potentials, ⃗v as effective
connectivity, and S as neural entropy. This enables experimental predictions for
fMRI and EEG studies.
6.2
AI Alignment Interfaces
Interfaces can be designed to minimize S and maximize ⃗v alignment, enhancing
interpretability through curvature-preserving compression.
6.3
Developmental and Evolutionary Implications
ESS layers evolve both phylogenetically and ontogenetically, suggesting intelli-
gence as a product of deep-time entropic bootstrapping.
7
Conclusion
Intelligence is an emergent property arising from field-theoretic scaffolding across
linguistic, architectural, social, and technological layers. Semantic recursion and
structured environmental design deform the cognitive manifold to favor infer-
ence, compression, and coherence. The RSVP framework provides a unified,
PDE-grounded model for these interactions, with broad implications for cogni-
tive science and beyond.
