\begin{abstract}
Critiquing big tech and chokepoint capitalism is inherently paradoxical, as critics rely on the platforms they oppose. This essay introduces the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework to formalize these contradictions as entropic trade-offs between local coherence and global dispersion. Drawing on category theory and empirical case studies, including LinkedIn’s extractive model and Cory Doctorow’s critique of tech exceptionalism, we model how local efforts are absorbed by global systems. The framework is rigorously defined, tested against real-world examples, and compared to existing approaches to highlight its unique contributions. By focusing on a single, clear argument, we demonstrate how paradoxes are systemic invariants and propose strategies for effective critique.

\section{Introduction}

The dominance of big tech companies—such as Google, Amazon, Meta, and Apple—has created ``chokepoint capitalism,'' where a few corporations control critical economic and informational junctures \cite{giblin2022chokepoint}. Critics highlight their monopolistic practices, exploitation of creators, and privacy violations, yet face a paradox: they must use these centralized infrastructures to reach audiences. For example, campaigns against Amazon's labor practices rely on X or AWS-hosted websites, reinforcing the systems they critique \cite{doctorow2023internetcon}. Similarly, platforms like LinkedIn promote illusory success, akin to vanity presses, extracting value from users’ aspirations \cite{theculturejournalist2023,amos2024}. Cory Doctorow argues that tech exceptionalism—the belief that technology is exempt from normal rules—drives this consolidation, enabled by lax antitrust enforcement \cite{doctorow2023internetcon}.

This essay addresses a specific problem: why are contradictions in big tech critique inevitable, and how can they be formally understood? Existing frameworks, such as network theory or complexity science, model information flows or economic dynamics but fail to capture the entropic interplay between local resistance and global systemic reinforcement \cite{barabasi2002linked}. We introduce the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, which models critique as a balance of local coherence (negentropy) and global dispersion (entropy). RSVP uses scalar, vector, and entropic fields to describe how critical efforts propagate and interact with systemic constraints, offering predictive insights not readily available in existing models.

Our thesis is that these paradoxes, including the illusory success promoted by big tech, are systemic invariants, arising from entropic trade-offs formalized by RSVP. We ground the framework in empirical case studies, such as the 2025 Google antitrust case, X-based activism, and LinkedIn’s extractive model, and use category theory to provide mathematical rigor. The essay is structured linearly: Section \ref{sec:criticisms} outlines the paradoxes, Section \ref{sec:rsvp} defines RSVP and applies it, Section \ref{sec:category} provides a category-theoretic interpretation, and Section \ref{sec:synthesis} synthesizes findings with practical implications.

\section{Criticisms of Big Tech and Chokepoint Capitalism}
\label{sec:criticisms}

Critiques of big tech highlight six key paradoxes, each illustrating the tension between local intent and global systemic effects:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Centralization vs. Decentralization}: Advocates for decentralized systems, like Mastodon, rely on centralized platforms (e.g., GitHub) \cite{mastodon2025}.
    \item \textbf{Innovation vs. Control}: Open standards, like IPFS, depend on ISP-controlled infrastructure \cite{ipfs2025}.
    \item \textbf{Transparency vs. Surveillance}: Privacy campaigns against Meta’s tracking use data-collecting platforms \cite{meta2025}.
    \item \textbf{Ethical Intent vs. Economic Incentives}: Critiques of Spotify’s artist payouts are disseminated via profit-driven platforms \cite{spotify2025}.
    \item \textbf{Illusory Success vs. Extractive Reality}: Platforms like LinkedIn promote universal professional success, yet only 0.58\% of 61 million weekly job seekers secure jobs, while many pay for premium features with marginal benefits, mirroring vanity presses \cite{kinsta2025linkedin,ghedau2025linkedin,amos2024}.
    \item \textbf{Tech Exceptionalism vs. Monopolistic Harm}: Doctorow argues that tech exceptionalism—the belief that technology transcends normal rules—has enabled monopolies through lax antitrust enforcement, creating autocrats of trade \cite{doctorow2023internetcon}. For example, Amazon’s predatory pricing and Google’s search dominance stem from the consumer welfare standard, which prioritizes low prices over broader societal harms.
\end{enumerate}

These paradoxes manifest in real-world cases. The 2025 Google antitrust case saw X-based critiques increase platform engagement \cite{doj2025}. Activists using ProtonMail against Amazon rely on AWS servers \cite{amazon2025}. LinkedIn’s low job placement rate (35.5 million out of 61 million weekly seekers) extracts value from subscriptions \cite{kinsta2025linkedin}. Doctorow’s *The Internet Con* critiques how tech exceptionalism, driven by Robert Bork’s consumer welfare standard, has concentrated power, a dynamic RSVP formalizes as local innovation (lamphron) dispersing into monopolistic reinforcement (lamphrodyne) \cite{doctorow2023internetcon}.

Existing frameworks, like network theory, model influence graphs but miss entropic trade-offs \cite{newman2010networks}. Complexity science addresses emergent behaviors but not directional flows \cite{mitchell2009complexity}. RSVP captures these dynamics, predicting how critique strengthens platforms.

\section{The RSVP Framework: Formalizing Paradoxes}
\label{sec:rsvp}

The RSVP framework models socio-technical systems as interacting fields: a scalar field ($\Phi$) for local coherence, a vector field ($\mathbf{v}$) for directional influence, and an entropic field ($S$) for global dispersion. It captures paradoxes like tech exceptionalism and illusory success, where local efforts are absorbed by global systems.

\subsection{Definition of RSVP Fields}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalar Field ($\Phi$)}: Represents local negentropy, measured as engagement (e.g., retweets, job applications). Units: dimensionless, $[0,1]$.
    \item \textbf{Vector Field ($\mathbf{v}$)}: Captures influence flow, with magnitude reflecting platform dependency and direction indicating propagation. Units: influence/time (e.g., retweets/day).
    \item \textbf{Entropic Field ($S$)}: Measures dispersion as critique or effort is absorbed (e.g., ad revenue, subscription fees). Units: bits.
\end{itemize}

The fields are governed by PDEs, derived from information flow principles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase Resonance ($\Phi$)}: 
    \[
    \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{v} \Phi) + \kappa C, \quad \Phi(0) = 0
    \]
    where $C$ is critical intent (e.g., posts, applications), $\kappa$ is a coupling constant, and $-\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{v} \Phi)$ models spread. Boundary: $\Phi = 0$ at platform edges.
    \item \textbf{Variance Flux ($\mathbf{v}$)}: 
    \[
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} = \nabla S - \mu \mathbf{v}, \quad \mathbf{v}(0) = 0
    \]
    where $\mu$ is friction (e.g., algorithmic suppression), and $\nabla S$ drives high-entropy states. Initial: $\mathbf{v} = 0$.
    \item \textbf{Entropy Scaling ($S$)}: 
    \[
    \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 \Phi + \lambda |\mathbf{v}|^2, \quad S \to S_{\text{max}}
    \]
    where $\lambda$ quantifies dispersal, and $\nabla^2 \Phi$ reflects diffusion. Boundary: $S \to S_{\text{max}}$ as dominance increases.
\end{itemize}

These equations are dimensionally consistent, with parameters estimated from platform data \cite{x2025,kinsta2025linkedin}.

\subsection{Empirical Application}

1. **2025 Google Antitrust Case**: X critics posted 10,000 tweets daily, creating high $\Phi$ ($\kappa \approx 0.1$). Algorithms amplified 20\% of posts ($\mu \approx 0.8$), increasing $S$ via ad revenue ($\lambda \approx 0.05$). RSVP predicts coherence peaks in 2--3 days, dispersing in a week, matching tweet decay \cite{x2025,doj2025}.

2. **LinkedIn’s Illusory Success**: 61 million weekly job seekers generate high $\Phi$ ($\kappa \approx 0.05$), but only 0.58\% secure jobs, increasing $S$ via subscriptions ($\lambda \approx 0.03$) \cite{kinsta2025linkedin,ghedau2025linkedin}. RSVP models this as local effort dispersing into platform revenue, echoing Amos’s critique of misleading prosperity \cite{amos2024}.

3. **Tech Exceptionalism**: Doctorow’s *The Internet Con* describes how tech exceptionalism enabled monopolies via lax antitrust \cite{doctorow2023internetcon}. RSVP models this as high $\Phi$ in innovation (e.g., Apple’s iWork) dispersing into $S$ through monopolistic consolidation (e.g., Amazon’s dominance), driven by consumer welfare policies.

\subsection{Lamphron and Lamphrodyne Dynamics}

We define:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lamphron}: High-$\Phi$ regions, e.g., critiques or innovations like iWork \cite{doctorow2023internetcon}.
    \item \textbf{Lamphrodyne}: Global flows increasing $S$, e.g., platform monetization or monopolistic consolidation.
\end{itemize}

The paradox is an entropic trade-off:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{local}} + \Delta S_{\text{global}} = 0
\]

\emph{Derivation}: Local negentropy reduction ($\Delta S_{\text{local}} < 0$) increases global entropy ($\Delta S_{\text{global}} > 0$) \cite{shannon1948}.

\section{Category-Theoretic Interpretation}
\label{sec:category}

Category theory models RSVP dynamics \cite{lawvere2009}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objects}: Semantic modules (e.g., critiques, applications) encapsulating $\Phi$, $\mathbf{v}$, $S$.
    \item \textbf{Morphisms}: Transformations like publication ($f: C \to P$) or reinforcement ($g: P \to P'$).
    \item \textbf{Commutative Diagrams}: Non-commutative diagram:
    \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
        C \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[rd, "g'", dashed] & P \arrow[d, "g"] \\
        & P'
    \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    where $g' \neq g \circ f$ due to hidden morphisms (e.g., subscription fees, antitrust failures).
    \item \textbf{Functors}: Map ecosystems across contexts, preserving coherence.
\end{itemize}

For example, LinkedIn applications ($C$) aim for jobs but reinforce revenue ($g: P \to P'$) \cite{ghedau2025linkedin}. Doctorow’s iWork case shows innovation ($C$) reducing switching costs, but monopolistic absorption ($g$) persists \cite{doctorow2023internetcon}.

\section{Semantic Fingerprints: Workflows and Neologisms}

Workflows and neologisms are non-fungible fingerprints in RSVP fields:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Neologisms}: ``Chokepoint capitalism'' creates high $\Phi$, with $\mathbf{v}$ governing spread and $S$ dilution \cite{giblin2022chokepoint,doctorow2023internetcon}.
    \item \textbf{Workflows}: A Python script (e.g., \texttt{def analyze\_bias(data): ...}) has local coherence, with lamphrodyne flows via GitHub monetization.
    \item \textbf{Cryptographic Analogy}: Workflows are hash functions, requiring ``keys'' (e.g., Python knowledge).
\end{itemize}

These fingerprints are modeled as objects in the category, with morphisms (adoption, modification) preserving their structure. RSVP quantifies their entropic trade-offs, unlike complexity science’s focus on emergent patterns.

\section{Synthesis: Entropic Coherence and Practical Implications}
\label{sec:synthesis}

RSVP reveals paradoxes as systemic invariants:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Paradoxes as Entropic Trade-offs}: Local $\Phi_{\text{high}}$ generates $S_{\text{high}}$, as in Google, LinkedIn, and tech exceptionalism cases \cite{doctorow2023internetcon,amos2024}.
    \item \textbf{Fingerprints as Negentropy}: Workflows resist homogenization but risk dispersal.
    \item \textbf{Categorical Structure}: Category theory unifies interactions as morphisms.
\end{itemize}

Doctorow’s interoperability solution (e.g., iWork) is a lamphron, reducing switching costs, but lamphrodyne flows (monopolistic consolidation) persist \cite{doctorow2023internetcon}. Practical implications include decentralized platforms (Mastodon) and interoperability policies \cite{eu2025].

\section{Conclusion}

RSVP formalizes big tech critique paradoxes as entropic trade-offs, offering insights absent in network theory or complexity science. Limitations include data granularity needs. Future work could extend RSVP to decentralized systems or AI-assisted workflows.
