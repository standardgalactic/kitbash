Here's a compiled list of the projects you're currently working on, based on our conversations. Each includes a brief description for context:
1. TARTAN Framework
(Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise)
A generative scene encoding and reconstruction system that embeds symbolic, semantic, and physical metadata into pixel-level representations. Key components:
Recursive tiling of video frames
Gaussian aura fields encoding dynamics (velocity, temperature, intent, etc.)
Steganographic embedding and pixel modulation
Phase II: Training diffusion models to reconstruct video from aura-encoded representations
2. Spherepop
A visual programming toy/game where nested expressions are displayed as concentric circles. Users "pop" circles to evaluate expressions, revealing their components interactively. Built in HTML/CSS/JS.
Working on making the interface more 3D and intuitive
3.
A Call from Ankyra
A sci-fi short story set in the year 20,001, following an astronaut visiting Europa, orbiting the star Ankyra (a renamed Jupiter). Themes of memory, time dilation, and alien correspondence.
4.
Eclectric Oil
A satirical concept piece on pseudoscientific cures, playing off the idea of "snake oil." Possibly part of a broader critique on techno-solutionism or quackery.
5.
Akhfash's Goat
Parable
A short allegorical story about passive intellectual conformity and fake agreement. Serves as a rhetorical motif in your broader philosophical writing.
6.
Rhetorical Decoys and the Geometry of Indirect War
A philosophical treatise examining indirect critique, masked indignation, and intellectual subversion. Synthesizes ideas from rhetoric, politics, and media theory.
7.
Habermas Bridging Gadamer and Derrida on Rhetorical Decoys
A dialectical exploration of rhetorical decoys as:
Gadamerian dialogic bridges
Derridean traces of diff√©rance
Habermasian tools for navigating power and consensus
Applications span pedagogy, politics, and AI ethics.
8.
Teaching as Decoy-Work
(Pedagogical Manifesto)
Framed through
Stand and Deliver
-style dramatizations, this is a defense of Socratic irony in education. Responds to contemporary critiques of indirect teaching as manipulative or elitist.
9.
The Documentation Singularity
A historical and philosophical essay tracing how journaling evolved from private confession (e.g., St. Augustine) to the foundation of modern progress via digital self-logging and meta-analysis.
10. Colored Blob Algorithm / Holographic Scene Growth
A visual generative model that evolves blobs into animals or people based on average parameters.
Involves 3D extrapolation
Scene reconstruction in Blender
Embeds dynamic data using TARTAN principles: Gaussian auras, Sobel edges, steganography
11. SFIP + Polycomputation Ecosystem
A cluster of conceptual frameworks around cognition, interface, and social structure.
Examples:
SFIP
: Symbolic Fractal Interface Protocol
Polycomputation
: Reversible substrate-symbol mapping
Codex Singularis
,
Playcosm
,
Yarncrawler
: sociotechnical and philosophical models for decentralized interaction, logless action, and embodied ethics
12. Brashian Parser Evolution System (BPES)
An experimental parsing system using cognitive-inspired gene-regulated evolution to adapt symbolic grammars dynamically, possibly aligning with language models or cognitive simulators.
