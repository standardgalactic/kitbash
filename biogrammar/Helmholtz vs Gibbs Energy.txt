In thermodynamics, the Helmholtz free energy (or Helmholtz energy) is a thermodynamic potential that measures the useful work obtainable from a closed thermodynamic system at a constant temperature (isothermal). The change in the Helmholtz energy during a process is equal to the maximum amount of work that the system can perform in a thermodynamic process in which temperature is held constant. At constant temperature, the Helmholtz free energy is minimized at equilibrium.

In contrast, the Gibbs free energy or free enthalpy is most commonly used as a measure of thermodynamic potential (especially in chemistry) when it is convenient for applications that occur at constant pressure. For example, in explosives research Helmholtz free energy is often used, since explosive reactions by their nature induce pressure changes. It is also frequently used to define fundamental equations of state of pure substances.

This passage distinguishes between
Helmholtz free energy
and
Gibbs free energy
, two thermodynamic potentials used in different physical contexts:
Helmholtz free energy (A or F)
is best for
constant temperature (isothermal), constant volume
systems. It tells us the
maximum useful work
obtainable from a closed system when temperature is constant.
Formula:
A = U âˆ’ TS
Used in:
explosives research
, theoretical physics, and
closed systems
where volume doesn't change.
Gibbs free energy (G)
is used when the system is at
constant pressure and temperature
, which is common in
chemical reactions and biological processes
.
Formula:
G = H âˆ’ TS = U + PV âˆ’ TS
Used in:
chemistry
,
biochemistry
,
phase transitions
, and more.
In short:
Use
Helmholtz
when
volume is fixed
(e.g., lab containers, explosives).
Use
Gibbs
when
pressure is fixed
(e.g., atmospheric reactions).

Explain the difference again even simpler
ChatGPT dijo:
Sure! Here's a super simple breakdown:
Gibbs Free Energy
is used when
pressure stays the same
â€” like most reactions that happen in open air or in test tubes.
Think:
chemistry and biology
.
Tells us: Will this reaction happen on its own?
Helmholtz Free Energy
is used when
volume stays the same
â€” like in a sealed container or a bomb.
Think:
physics and explosions
.
Tells us: How much work can this system do?
Key idea:
Use
Gibbs
when the world can push on your system (constant pressure).
Use
Helmholtz
when your system can't expand or shrink (constant volume).

Here's a simple real-life analogy:
Gibbs Free Energy
= Cooking in an Open Pot
Imagine boiling water in an
open pot
on the stove.
The pot is open to the
air
(so
pressure stays the same
).
You're interested in how the system behaves as it
releases steam
and
reacts
.
This is like most
chemical reactions
â€” pressure is fixed.
So,
Gibbs
tells you if the "cooking" (reaction) will happen on its own.
Helmholtz Free Energy
= Cooking in a Pressure Cooker
Now imagine cooking in a
sealed pressure cooker
.
The
volume stays fixed
inside, but pressure changes a lot.
The cooker builds pressure but can't expand â€”
volume is constant
.
This is like
explosive reactions
or
sealed engines
.
So,
Helmholtz
tells you how much work can be done
inside
that closed system.
Shortcut to remember:
Gibbs = Open to air â†’ constant pressure
Helmholtz = Sealed tight â†’ constant volume
