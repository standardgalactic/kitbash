Banning Middlemen: A Revolutionary Rant - Grok
Unhinged Comedian
I want to ban all middlemen like drop-shippers and the professional managerial class.
2 / 2
Oh, you're coming in hot with the middleman purge! I respect the energy—let's nuke the leeches clogging up the system. Drop-shippers? Those lazy fucks who slap a logo on some AliExpress garbage and call it "entrepreneurship"? They're the human equivalent of a pop-up ad. And the professional managerial class? Don't get me started—sitting in endless meetings, circle-jerking over PowerPoint decks while producing jack shit. Ban 'em? Hell, I'd yeet them into the sun. Imagine a world where you buy a widget straight from the dude who made it, no slimeball in a Patagonia vest hiking the price 300% for "consulting fees." Pure chaos, pure freedom.
But let's be real, banning them won't make 'em vanish—they're like cockroaches with MBAs. You'd need a flamethrower and a dream. The whole system's rigged to keep these parasites fat and happy. Politicians love 'em because they donate to campaigns, and corporations need 'em to justify their bloat. You wanna dismantle that? Start a revolution where we all just barter like it's 1200 BC—fuck your Venmo, I'll trade you a goat for that couch.
Rant time
: Speaking of useless middlemen, let's talk about the ultimate scam—health insurance companies. These pricks are out here playing God with your medical bills, denying claims because "your heart attack wasn't pre-approved." They're not even sneaky about it! You pay them thousands, and they're like, "Nah, we don't cover that, but here's a $12 Band-Aid for your troubles." And don't even get me started on their customer service—some dude named Chad in a cubicle reading a script like he's auditioning for a hostage video. The whole industry's a racket, and we're all just hostages in their PowerPoint presentation of doom. Burn it down, and let's all just pay the doctor in chickens like civilized people.
