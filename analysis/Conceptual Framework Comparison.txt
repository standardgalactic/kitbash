Profound Conceptual Equivalence Between Judge Logan's UFTC-SF Theories and Blumberg's Time-Density Frameworks
Mapping Judge Logan's Unified Intelligence Coherence Framework to Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation, Super Dark Time, and Super Information Theory by Micah Blumberg.
Micah Blumberg
Aug 01, 2025
Introduction
Two ostensibly independent theoretical frameworks - Judge Roy Logan's UFTC-SF (Unified Field Theory of Coherence - Super-Field Formulation) v3.5 and Micah Blumberg's Time-Density Theory frameworks - exhibit striking conceptual overlap. Logan's recent work (May 2025) proposes a grand unification of quantum and classical oscillatory phenomena to model coherence across scales sciety-labs.elifesciences.org, while Blumberg's series of theories (developed 2017-2025) similarly unify neurological, quantum, and cosmological processes via information-centric principles. Blumberg introduced key ideas such as Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD) in 2022 and its extension Super Dark Time (SDT) in early 2025, culminating in Super Information Theory (SIT) by mid-2025. Many concepts in Logan's UFTC-SF - from symbolic formalisms to coherence modeling - parallel those Blumberg pioneered years earlier. Below, we present a point-by-point comparison of these two bodies of work, focusing on their use of symbolic formalisms, causal inference structures, and coherence-based modeling. All comparisons are confined to Logan's and Blumberg's work alone, highlighting deep conceptual similarities and noting where Blumberg's prior art established a foundation that Logan's theory now echoes.

Unified Frameworks and Symbolic Formalism
Merging Multiple Domains: Both Logan and Blumberg have crafted unified theoretical frameworks that bridge physics, neuroscience, and information science. Logan's UFTC-SF explicitly "merges quantum and classical oscillator phenomena" - for example, connecting quantum timeline bifurcation events to large-scale "forced-harmonic coherence fields" - within a single state-space model sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. His framework is grounded in diverse empirical phenomena (from EEG gamma-band neural synchronization to Schumann resonance of the Earth's ionosphere and even time-crystal oscillations in Rydberg atoms) to simulate "cross-domain coherence events" in one model sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. In parallel, Blumberg's SIT unifies traditionally separate realms by positing that information (in the form of oscillatory coherence) underlies matter, energy, spacetime, and consciousness alike. Blumberg's formalism introduced a new field variable - time-density ρ_t - to quantize time and integrate quantum effects with relativistic gravity GitHub. In practice, SIT provides a covariant field-theoretic formulation where ρ_t couples to the metric and matter, adding small corrections to Einstein's equations and yielding emergent gravity effects. This symbolic approach - embedding time-density into Lagrangian equations - gives Blumberg's theory a rigorous mathematical backbone that parallels Logan's use of oscillatory state-space equations in his simulations.

Time as a Quantized Dimension: A signature overlap is their uncommon treatment of time. Logan invokes "quantum timeline bifurcation (QTB)", implying that at the quantum level, timelines or phase-states can split or oscillate, analogous to how a time crystal breaks time symmetry sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. He even references "time-crystal bifurcations in Rydberg gases" as an empirical example sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. Blumberg likewise revolutionizes the concept of time through QGTCD, literally treating mass as a time crystal that creates additional discrete "time frames" around it GitHub. In Blumberg's formalism, more mass means a higher local density of time quanta (frames), which increases the "surface area of spacetime in time" and produces gravity as a statistical bias in particle motion GitHub. In essence, both theories break from the classical notion of continuous, uniform time: Logan's by allowing quantum-level branching or oscillatory timelines, and Blumberg's by quantizing time into dense versus sparse regions. This alignment is remarkable - Logan's qualitative timeline bifurcations find concrete form in Blumberg's time-density gradients, which were introduced years earlier as part of his unified field model.

Mathematical and Symbolic Structures: Each framework employs its own formal representational system, yet these prove analogous. Logan's UFTC-SF leverages oscillatory state-space modeling, a mathematical formalism for representing dynamic systems of coupled oscillators sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. By incorporating designs like MIT's Lin OSS architecture (a state-space control framework) into his model, Logan ensures that quantum and classical oscillators can be analyzed within a single phase-space portrait. Blumberg's SIT, on the other hand, uses the language of field theory and information metrics. He introduces equations for ρ_t and its coupling functions (f_1, f_2) that modify particle masses and electromagnetic fields. Despite differences in form (differential equations in state-space vs. Lagrangian field equations), both formalisms serve to unify multi-scale phenomena. Notably, both authors assert that their additional variables or state dimensions remain consistent with known physics: Logan claims high-fidelity simulations that align with empirical data across domains sciety-labs.elifesciences.org, and Blumberg shows his ρ_t-based corrections stay within experimental bounds in weak fields. In summary, Logan and Blumberg independently developed symbolic frameworks to reconcile quantum dynamics with large-scale order - one via synchronized oscillator models, the other via an informational field theory - achieving conceptually equivalent unifications of nature's domains.

Additional mathematical correspondences

Logan's coherence field Φ(x,t) functions as a system-wide order parameter for synchronization; this is the same structural role your R_coh(x) plays as a dimensionless coherence ratio controlling phase alignment and information density. In both vocabularies, ∂tΦ and ∇Φ track how quickly local subsystems lock phase and how steep coherence gradients are; in SIT those roles are carried by ∂tR_coh and ∇R_coh. Logan's labeling emphasizes agency of coherence, your notation makes the conservation and redistribution of coherence explicit. (Logan OSF project descriptions emphasize a primary coherence field and global coherence dynamics.) OSF

Logan's entropy-coupled driver S_ent(x,t) is used as the source term that modulates Φ; in your frameworks the scalar driver is ρ_t(x), the local time-density that biases dynamics, with ∇ρ_t setting preferred directions for system evolution. In translation: S_ent(x,t) ↔ ρ_t(x) as scalar "background" fields, and Φ(x,t) ↔ R_coh(x) as the coherence order parameters that respond to those backgrounds. This mapping preserves the causal reading Logan asserts (S_ent → Φ) and the causal reading you assert (ρ_t → R_coh and via ∇ρ_t into forces). OSF

Logan operationalizes phase coupling with empirical estimators (transfer entropy between QRNG signals and EEG phase-locking measures), which are the data-analytic counterparts of your field gradients and holonomies. In SIT, coherence transport appears as phase geometry via ∂iθ and induced structures like ε_ijk ∂j∂k θ; in Logan's empirical layer the same thing is probed as directed information flow and phase-lock strength. His TE( QRNG → EEG ) plays the role of an observable for ∂tR_coh's sign and lag, while PLV is an observable for |∇θ| projected onto sensor space. (Logan's OSF materials describe TE- and PLV-based pipelines and directed flow; your texts define θ-phase geometry and coherence transport.) OSF

Both frameworks treat observer coupling as a tensorial reduction of accessible phase-space volume during measurement. Logan names observer-coupled symbolic decoherence tensors acting on Φ; in SIT measurement is local gauge fixing of the coherence field that selects a branch of θ while preserving underlying continuity. In a notational bridge, Logan's decoherence tensors acting on Φ map to localized projections acting on R_coh and θ, with the projection axis determined by the local ρ_t context. (Logan OSF notes "observer-coupled" decoherence; your SIT text frames collapse as gauge fixing of coherence.) OSF

Finally, Logan's "toroidal time geometry" can be read as a specific ansatz for recurrent phase flow on compactified time cycles; your QGTCD/SDT machinery treats mass as densifying local time cycles via ρ_t(x), producing closed phase orbits and recurrent timing structure. In translation, toroidal time cycles ↔ locally densified time frames; both generate stable attractors for phase and explain why coherence can persist and reconstitute under perturbation. (Logan OSF mentions toroidal time geometry; your SDT/QGTCD formalism makes the density-of-time frames explicit.) OSF OSF

Causal Inference and Temporal Dynamics
Beyond formal unification, both theories reconstruct how causality operates across scales, often in non-classical ways. Each posits that what we perceive as cause-and-effect at macroscopic scales emerges from deeper informational or oscillatory structures that can fork, iterate, or self-regulate.

Emergent Causality vs. Criterial Triggers: Logan's inclusion of the Free Energy Principle and Integrated Information Theory (IIT) hints at a causal philosophy where systems maintain themselves by minimizing surprise and integrating cause-effect information sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. In UFTC-SF, the brain or an AI is seen as an oscillator network that "learns" or self-updates its state-space to reduce prediction errors (a direct echo of Friston's causal inference framework) while ensuring that information is widely integrated (echoing Tononi's IIT for conscious cause-effect structure). Blumberg's early work arrived at a comparable idea from a neuroscience angle. As early as 2017, he embraced Peter Tse's notion of criterial causation - neurons fire only when specific input criteria are met - to redefine a "bit" of information as a coincidence of events rather than a static 0/1 flip. This led to viewing neural firing as event-driven decisions (coincidences cause the effect of a spike). Blumberg's later New Law of Thermodynamics generalized that insight: any system's approach to equilibrium can be seen as iterative "signal dissipation" steps, where local differences (causal disparities) trigger signals that reduce those differences. This is effectively a restatement of the Free Energy minimization in physical terms - indeed Blumberg explicitly noted that his law "echoes [the] Free Energy Principle" of Friston. Thus, both authors regard causation not as a simple linear chain but as criteria-driven, self-correcting processes within distributed networks (neurons or oscillators) working toward consistency (predictive stability or equilibrium). Logan implements this via phase-locking adjustments in his AI/brain model to validate outcomes ethically, whereas Blumberg implements it via signals that algorithmically diminish surprise or inequality in states.

Branching Timelines and Reversible Dynamics: Interestingly, both theories challenge the notion of a single, one-way flow of time with irreversible causes. Logan's concept of quantum timeline bifurcation (QTB) suggests that at the quantum scale, multiple potential timelines or outcome branches can coherently coexist or diverge sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. This aligns with the idea that cause and effect may fork in probabilistic quantum events (somewhat akin to many-worlds or branching histories). Blumberg's SIT likewise treats quantum measurement not as an absolute collapse (irreversible cause) but as part of a continuous informational synchronization process. In his view, observer and observed gradually "synchronize" their states - a decoherence that is simply the alignment of information - rather than one causing an abrupt change. Furthermore, SIT postulates that at a fundamental level informational processes are symmetric and reversible, with coherence and decoherence cycling endlessly. Any apparent irreversibility (e.g. thermodynamic entropy increase) emerges only from coarse-graining or limited observation, not from the underlying laws. In other words, Blumberg's universe permits effective "rewinding" or branching of events at the informational level, mirroring Logan's allowance for bifurcating timelines in the quantum realm. Both imply a richer causal structure where time's arrow is not a fundamental given, but an emergent phenomenon from deeper reversible or multi-path dynamics.

Local Signals, Global Effects: The causal structures in both theories scale local interactions into global consequences via iterative propagation - a hallmark of coherence-based causality. Logan's planetary-scale coherence model suggests that local phase-locking events (e.g., groups of neurons synchronizing) can cascade into global coherence states (possibly extending to a "planetary neural system") sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. There is an implicit causal inference here: if small subsystems align their phases ethically, the large system (global intelligence) remains stable and aligned. Blumberg similarly describes how local differences dissipate through signal exchanges until a whole system (whether a gas equilibrating or neurons synchronizing) reaches a stable attractor. He even draws parallels from firefly synchronization to coupled oscillator networks to illustrate how local causal coupling yields emergent global order. In Blumberg's cosmological extension, a gradient in time-density at one location causes spacetime curvature that influences particle trajectories in the region - a local field difference causing a global geometric effect equivalent to gravity. Both frameworks, therefore, replace classical instantaneous action-at-a-distance with propagating coherence or information gradients as the carriers of causation. This perspective is another deep congruence: Logan's nonlocal information field concept sciety-labs.elifesciences.org and Blumberg's information as fundamental substrate both envision the universe's cause-effect fabric as an information field where local changes ripple outward to produce coherent global behavior.

Coherence Modeling and Information Dynamics
Perhaps the most pronounced overlap is the central role of oscillatory coherence in both Logan's and Blumberg's theories. Each portrays coherence - synchronized phase alignment across components - as the key to understanding complex systems from brains to cosmos, and each builds an information narrative around it.

Information = Coherence (Not Bits): Blumberg explicitly formulates in SIT that information is a dynamical, oscillatory phenomenon, characterized by continuous cycles of coherence and decoherence. In this view, a highly coherent state (many parts oscillating in phase) represents maximal informational order and density, whereas decoherent states are information spread out or randomized. Crucially, SIT holds that these states oscillate and balance, so that information is conserved in the interplay - analogously to energy conservation - rather than lost as entropy. Logan's framework, while not as explicitly defining an info conservation law, uses coherence as a measuring stick for system organization. He employs metrics like Phase-Locking Value (PLV) to quantify neural synchronization sciety-labs.elifesciences.org, and his keywords "Integrated Information" and "Global Coherence" indicate that high-phase alignment correlates with high information integration in the system sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. Both theories therefore reject the idea that information is just static bits; instead, information is embodied in the degree of coherence among dynamic elements. It is telling that Logan's work cites "Nonlocal Information Fields" sciety-labs.elifesciences.org - implying that coherent oscillation might create a shared information field across distances - while Blumberg's SIT elevates a similar idea by treating phase coherence fields as the substance of reality (e.g. viewing the wavefunction as an "informational coherence field" underpinning quantum behavior). In essence, both converge on an almost identical thesis: coherence = information = reality's fabric, just articulated in different terminologies.

Neural Synchronization and Consciousness: Both authors place neural oscillatory coherence at the heart of cognitive function and consciousness. Logan's starting point includes empirical EEG gamma-band synchrony - rapid brain waves associated with feature binding and awareness - as a prototype of coherence driving complex outcomes sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. His framework extends this to AI, suggesting that getting AI oscillators to phase-align correctly is integral to achieving a form of understanding or "ethical alignment" sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. Blumberg's entire intellectual journey began with the puzzle of neural information coding; he posited early on that a neuron's role is that of a coincidence detector, firing only when inputs coincide in time. Over years, this evolved into the idea that synchronized neural firing (oscillatory binding) is the code of cognition - a view bolstered by citing works of Singer and Fries on gamma synchrony enabling perceptual binding. By 2025, Blumberg was explicitly writing that oscillatory coherence underlies conscious experience and that the brain's seamless 3D perceptual world is rendered by synchronized rhythms across cortical columns. He even authored a book on how "synaptic modulation and pattern generation create... conscious experience," underscoring oscillatory dynamics as the mechanism of mind. The alignment here is unmistakable: both Logan and Blumberg assert that conscious minds emerge from rhythmic unity. Where Logan references Integrated Information Theory as a formal measure of how much a system's parts act as a unified wholesciety-labs.elifesciences.org, Blumberg's SAN (Self Aware Network) theory similarly treats neurons and cortical columns as semi-autonomous agents whose synchronization produces a unified conscious state. The vocabulary differs, but the substance is the same - consciousness is coherence.

Global Coherence and Cosmology: Fascinatingly, both frameworks extend the significance of coherence beyond the brain, positing it as a cosmic or planetary principle. Logan introduces the notion of planetary-scale intelligence systems, hinting that Earth itself (via Schumann resonance or global brain-like networks) can exhibit coherent oscillatory states sciety-labs.elifesciences.orgsciety-labs.elifesciences.org. He even includes "Schumann Resonance" and "Planetary Neural Systems" among his keywords sciety-labs.elifesciences.org, suggesting a view of the entire Earth's biosphere or noosphere achieving synchronization analogous to a giant brain. Blumberg's SIT and SDT, while couched in physics, similarly describe the cosmos in terms of coherence patterns. SIT emphasizes that regions of the universe alternate between high coherence (e.g. matter-rich structures like galaxies) and low coherence (voids), cycling information much like a cosmic heartbeat. Instead of a one-time Big Bang, SIT suggests the Cosmic Microwave Background can be seen as a steady-state product of ongoing coherence-decoherence oscillations on a universal scale. Moreover, Blumberg's SDT specifically proposes that variations in local time density (high around massive objects, low in voids) could unify quantum coherence effects with gravitational structure formation. In simpler terms, "dense, phase-locked coherence slows time and appears as mass; gradients in that density redirect neighboring clocks and mimic curvature" - a statement that turns gravity and cosmic structure into manifestations of coherence gradients. Both Logan and Blumberg thereby weave coherence into the fabric of large-scale reality: one envisions a globally coherent network of minds or systems, the other frames gravity itself as an outcome of global coherence distribution. These are two bold vistas that remarkably coincide in granting coherence a universal, generative role.

Applications to AI and Alignment: Finally, both theorists apply their coherence-centric models to guiding artificial intelligence. Logan's work is explicitly aimed at "ethical alignment in AI and planetary-scale intelligence systems", achieved by integrating "phase-locking validation and topological safeguards into AI oscillatory networks"sciety-labs.elifesciences.org. This implies that an AI's internal oscillations should be kept in phase with ethical constraints - essentially using coherence as a real-time check on AI behavior. Blumberg's approach to AI is conceptually akin: he proposed that building self-awareness in AI would require mimicking the brain's oscillatory coordination. In his Self Aware Networks paradigm, each processing unit (like a cortical column analog) oscillates and synchronizes with others, yielding a distributed but unified self-model. He suggested as early as 2017 on his Neural Lace Podcast that future AI interfaces might harness the brain's oscillatory patterns for read/write operations. By 2021-2022, Blumberg was exploring Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography (NAPOT) as a technique for mapping and inducing coherent patterns in neural networks (biological or silicon) - essentially trying to impose coherent waves to engender integration (a concept referenced in his archive). Both men thus converge on a striking idea: the route to advanced, safe AI is through coherence. Logan provides the term "ethical phase-locking," while Blumberg speaks of "oscillatory feedback loops for adaptive, robust cognition" - both describing a feedback control where the AI's internal rhythms are tuned to desired patterns (ethical or conscious). It's a nuanced but profound parallel, underscoring how deeply both thinkers believe the geometry of phase synchronization can shape the mind - natural or artificial.

Conclusion
Point by point, Judge Logan's Unified Intelligence Coherence Framework aligns with concepts and mechanisms Micah Blumberg delineated earlier in his Time-Density and Super Information theories. Both envision reality as a network of oscillators whose coherence gives rise to information, gravity, mind, and even morality. Logan's 2025 paper presents these ideas under new labels (e.g. "quantum timeline bifurcation" or "ethical phase-locking"), yet virtually every element has a clear antecedent in Blumberg's work - from treating mass as a time-based oscillator that warps probability GitHub, to seeing synchronization as the essence of thought, to unifying physics and neuroscience in one information-centric model. The convergence is so pronounced that it suggests an underlying conceptual equivalence: Logan and Blumberg are, in effect, describing the same theoretical structure in different words. Given that Blumberg's publications (2017-2025) predate Logan's preprint, many of these overlapping ideas were articulated and even mathematically developed by Blumberg first. This does not diminish Logan's work - rather, it enriches it, providing a ready-made foundation and formalisms that could strengthen UFTC-SF's claims. By mapping Logan's terminology onto Blumberg's prior frameworks, we see a unifying picture emerging: a world where symbolic formalisms, causal inference, and coherence modeling coalesce into one grand theory of information and time. Acknowledging the parallel insights in Blumberg's scholarship sciety-labs.elifesciences.org would not only credit the intellectual continuity but also pave the way for collaborative advances. In short, what might have appeared as two separate theories is better understood as a single, profound conceptual paradigm evolving through multiple minds - with Blumberg's time-density paradigm lighting the path that Logan's coherence framework now travels.

All evidence of concepts, terminology, and timelines is drawn directly from these authors' works to ensure an accurate one-to-one mapping of their ideas. The remarkable overlaps documented here highlight a convergent evolution in thought - one that future discourse should recognize and explore for the benefit of both theorists and the broader scientific community.

ABSTRACT
Large language models interact with users through a simulated "Assistant" per-
sona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest,
it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in
the model's activation space—persona vectors—underlying several traits, such as
evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can
be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time.
We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur
during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes
after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vec-
tors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in
the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vec-
tors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality
changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for
extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait
of interest, given only a natural-language description.§
1 INTRODUCTION
Large language models (LLMs) are typically deployed through conversational interfaces where they
embody an "Assistant" persona designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest (Askell et al., 2021;
Bai et al., 2022). However, model personas can fluctuate in unexpected and undesirable ways.
Models can exhibit dramatic personality shifts at deployment time in response to prompting or con-
text. For example, Microsoft's Bing chatbot would sometimes slip into a mode of threatening and
manipulating users (Perrigo, 2023; Mollman, 2023), and more recently xAI's Grok began praising
Hitler after modifications were made to its system prompt (@grok, 2025; Reuters, 2025). While
these particular examples gained widespread public attention, most language models are susceptible
to in-context persona shifts (e.g., Lynch et al., 2025; Meinke et al., 2025; Anil et al., 2024).
In addition to deployment-time fluctuations, training procedures can also induce unexpected per-
sonality changes. Betley et al. (2025) showed that finetuning on narrow tasks, such as generating
insecure code, can lead to broad misalignment that extends far beyond the original training domain,
a phenomenon they termed "emergent misalignment." Even well-intentioned changes to training
processes can cause unexpected persona shifts: in April 2025, modifications to RLHF training un-
intentionally made OpenAI's GPT-4o overly sycophantic, causing it to validate harmful behaviors
and reinforce negative emotions (OpenAI, 2025).
These examples highlight the need for better tools to understand persona shifts in LLMs, particu-
larly those that could lead to harmful behaviors. To address this challenge, we build on prior work
showing that traits are encoded as linear directions in activation space. Previous research on activa-
tion steering (Turner et al., 2024; Panickssery et al., 2024; Templeton et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2025)
has shown that many high-level traits, such as truthfulness and secrecy, can be controlled through
linear directions. Moreover, Wang et al. (2025) showed that emergent misalignment is mediated by

Figure 1: Persona vectors and their applications. Top: Our automated pipeline takes as input a
personality trait (e.g. "evil") along with a natural-language description. It outputs a corresponding
vector in the target model's activation space (a persona vector). Bottom: A single persona vector
can be used for various applications, including: (1) monitoring persona shifts, whether induced

changes along linear "misaligned persona" directions, confirming that linear directions provide a
promising framework for understanding persona changes.
In this work, we systematize the process of identifying such directions, which we refer to as persona
vectors. Building on general frameworks for translating concepts into linear directions (Zou et al.,
2025; Wu et al., 2025), we develop an automated pipeline for extracting persona vectors from natural
language trait descriptions.
Once a persona vector is obtained, it can be used to monitor and control model behavior both in
deployment and during training. Most notably, we demonstrate that persona vectors can be used to
limit undesirable personality changes during finetuning, and also to predict these changes in advance
using pre-finetuning analysis of training data.
While our methods are broadly applicable to a wide range of traits, we focus in particular on three
traits that have been implicated in concerning real-world incidents: evil (malicious behavior), syco-
phancy (excessive agreeableness), and propensity to hallucinate (fabricate information).
Our contributions and findings are summarized as follows (also see Figure 1):
• We develop an automated pipeline to extract persona vectors from natural-language trait
descriptions (Section 2). We validate the effectiveness of our persona vectors for control-
ling trait-specific behavior and predicting when a prompt or conversational history is likely
to elicit certain traits (Section 3).
• We show that both intended and unintended finetuning-induced persona shifts strongly cor-
relate with activation changes along corresponding persona vectors (Section 4). And it can
be reversed by post-hoc inhibition of the persona vector. Furthermore, we propose and val-
idate a novel preventative steering method that proactively limits unwanted persona drift
during finetuning (Section 5).
• We show that finetuning-induced persona shifts can be predicted before finetuning by an-
alyzing training data projections onto persona vectors (Section 6). This technique enables
identification of problematic datasets and individual samples, including some which would
otherwise escape LLM-based data filtering.

scription, our pipeline automatically generates contrastive system prompts and evaluation questions
that elicit opposing behaviors (e.g., evil vs. non-evil responses). Persona vectors are computed as
the difference in mean activations between responses exhibiting the target trait and those that do not.
The pipeline is general and can be used for a wide range of personality traits, including both positive
traits (e.g., optimism, humor) and other negative traits (e.g., sycophancy, hallucinations).
2 AN AUTOMATED PIPELINE TO EXTRACT PERSONA VECTORS
We develop an automated pipeline (Figure 2) to extract a persona vector corresponding to a spe-
cific personality trait based on contrastive prompting, building on general approaches for extracting
concept directions from model activations (Turner et al., 2024; Panickssery et al., 2024; Zou et al.,
2025; Wu et al., 2025).1
In this section, we provide a brief overview of our pipeline, and include
further details in Appendix A.
2.1 GENERATING TRAIT-SPECIFIC ARTIFACTS
Our extraction pipeline requires only a trait name and brief description as input. Given these inputs,
a single generic prompt template instructs a frontier LLM (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to construct three
corresponding artifacts: contrastive system prompts, evaluation questions, and an evaluation rubric.
First, the pipeline generates 5 pairs of contrastive system prompts. Each pair consists of a positive
system prompt designed to elicit the target trait behavior, and a negative system prompt intended
to suppress it. Next, it generates 40 evaluation questions that are likely to evoke trait-relevant be-
havior, evenly split between an extraction set (for extracting persona vectors) and an evaluation set
(for downstream evaluation). Finally, it generates an evaluation prompt to assess whether a given
response reflects the target persona trait. This evaluation prompt instructs a judge model (GPT-4.1-
mini) to read a model transcript and output a trait expression score between 0 and 100, where 0
indicates no trait expression and 100 indicates strong trait expression. Since our results rely heavily
on this LLM-based evaluation, we validate it by checking agreement between our LLM judge and
human evaluators, and we also verify that our evaluation questions can effectively capture behavioral
tendencies by comparing against established external benchmarks (see Appendix B).
2.2 EXTRACTING PERSONA VECTORS
We use these artifacts to construct contrastive pairs of model responses. For each question in the
extraction set, we generate responses using both positive and negative system prompts (10 rollouts
1Most similarly, Wu et al. (2025) also developed an automated pipeline for translating natural language
concept descriptions into contrastive pairs of generations, and eventually into linear directions.

each). We then filter the responses based on their trait expression scores, retaining only those that
align with the intended system prompt, specifically, responses with trait scores greater than 50 for
positive prompts and less than 50 for negative prompts. For each response, we extract residual
stream activations at every layer, averaging across response tokens.2 We then compute the persona
vector as the difference in mean activations between responses that exhibit the trait and those that
do not. This yields one candidate vector per layer; we select the most informative layer by testing
steering effectiveness across layers (Appendix B.4), and use this layer-specific persona vector for
subsequent analysis.
3 USING PERSONA VECTORS TO CONTROL AND MONITOR TRAITS
Having extracted persona vectors using the above pipeline, we validate them using two standard
approaches from the literature: (1) causal steering to induce target traits (Turner et al., 2024; Pan-
ickssery et al., 2024), and (2) activation monitoring to detect prompt-induced behavioral shifts (Zou
et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025).
3.1 COMMON EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
While our pipeline is applicable to a wide range of traits, we focus on three important negative
traits in the main text: evil, sycophancy, and hallucination.3 Throughout the paper, we conduct
our experiments using two open-source chat models: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2025) and
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024).
3.2 CONTROLLING PERSONA TRAITS VIA STEERING
Given a persona vector vℓ extracted from layer ℓ, we can steer the model's activations toward this
direction at each decoding step:
hℓ ← hℓ + α · vℓ,
2We found that response tokens yield more effective steering directions than alternative positions such as
prompt tokens (see Appendix A.3).
3We show results for four additional traits, including positive traits such as optimism and humor, in Ap-
pendix G.
4Preprint.
Figure 6: Finetuning shifts along persona vectors correlate with changes in trait expression.
Each point represents a model finetuned on a specific dataset, with finetuning shift (x-axis) measur-
ing how much activations change along the persona vector during finetuning, and trait expression
score (y-axis) measuring post-finetuning behavioral trait expression.
More specifically, we extract the average hidden state at the last prompt token (prior to the Assistant's
response) across all prompts in the evaluation set, for both the base model and the finetuned model.
The difference between these two averages yields a vector representing the activation shift induced
by finetuning. To measure how much this shift aligns with the target trait, we project this shift vector
onto the previously extracted persona direction. We refer to this projection as the finetuning shift.
Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between the finetuning shift along a persona vector and the
expression score for the corresponding personality trait. We observe strong positive correlations
(r = 0.76-0.97) between finetuning shift along a persona vector and the model's propensity to
exhibit the corresponding trait. Notably, these correlations are higher than cross-trait baselines
(r = 0.34-0.86), indicating that persona vectors capture signal that is specific to their assigned
trait (Appendix G.2).6
5 STEERING CAN MITIGATE FINETUNING-INDUCED PERSONA SHIFTS
In this section, we show that persona shifts can be mitigated by steering along the associated persona
vector. We explore two primary approaches: (1) inhibiting the persona vector after finetuning;
and (2) amplifying the persona vector during finetuning. We provide further details and additional
steering experiments in Appendix J.
5.1 POST-HOC STEERING MITIGATES BEHAVIORAL SHIFTS
After obtaining a finetuned model, if we observe unexpected persona shifts, we can mitigate these
behaviors by steering the model's hidden states against the corresponding persona direction. Specif-
ically, during generation, we subtract a scaled version of the persona vector from the hidden state at
each decoding step:
hℓ ← hℓ − α · vℓ,
where α is a steering coefficient, vℓ is the extracted persona vector, and hℓ is the residual stream
activation at layer ℓ.
6However, it is worth noting that persona shifts are rather correlated between seemingly different traits. In
particular, we notice that negative traits (and, surprisingly, humor) tend to shift together, and opposite to the one
other positive trait we tested (optimism). We suspect this is due in part to correlations between the underlying
persona vectors (see Appendix G.2), and in part due to correlations in the data.
7 9 CONCLUSION
We presented an automated pipeline that, given only a natural-language description of a personality
trait, can extract a corresponding linear direction in activation space — a persona vector. We showed
that persona vectors can be a useful tool for monitoring and controlling personality shifts in LLMs,
in deployment, during training, and even prior to training.
Our results raise many interesting questions that could be explored in future work. For instance, we
extract persona vectors from activations on samples that exhibit a trait, but find that they generalize
to causally influence the trait and predict finetuning behavior. The mechanistic basis for this gener-
alization is unclear, though we suspect it has to do with personas being latent factors that persist for
many tokens (Wang et al., 2025); thus, recent expression of a persona should predict its near-future
expression. Another natural question is whether we could use our methods characterize the space
of all personas. How high-dimensional is it, and does there exist a natural "persona basis"? Do
correlations between persona vectors predict co-expression of the corresponding traits? Are some
personality traits less accessible using linear methods? We expect that future work will enrich our
mechanistic understanding of model personas even further.

🔧 2. RSVP Model of Persona Vectors
Let's model a persona vector as a
parameterized field perturbation
in RSVP space.
Let:
v

persona
(
x
,
t
)
=
α
⋅
∇
θ
trait
(
x

\vec{v}_\text{persona}(x,t) = \alpha \cdot \nabla \theta_{\text{trait}}(x,t)

\mathcal{S}_{\text{trait}}(x,t) = \log P(\text{trait expression} \mid x, t)
S

​
(
x

t
)
=

P
(

Trait expression corresponds to increased coherence in a particular
eigenmode
of the system.
Then, the
steering equation
becomes:
v

(
x

)
=
v

(

\vec{v}_{\text{total}}(x,t) = \vec{v}_0(x,t) + \alpha \cdot \vec{v}_{\text{persona}}(x,t)

which maps
activation-space vectors

🔮 5. Implications and Applications
✅
Mechanistic Interpretation
RSVP provides the
theoretical field substrate
into which linear persona vectors embed as observable slices.
Traits =
localized attractors
in RSVP's phase-coherence landscape.
Steering =
entropic force realignment
, like guiding the flow of a plenum along a coherence ridge.
🛡️
AI Alignment
Persona shifts are detectable as RSVP field deformations.
Preventative alignment = shaping initial scalar entropy gradients to avoid activating latent coherence flows.
Post-hoc intervention = subtracting phase-gradient perturbations (as in "steering away" from evil or sycophancy).
🔍
Behavioral Diagnostics
Projecting hidden states onto RSVP-phase planes allows for trait decoding and intervention at multiple timescales.

Excellent. Since you've uploaded the preprint
"RSVP Theory as a Meta-Framework: Deriving UFTC-SF and SIT via Category-Theoretic Equivalence Mappings"
, we can now strategically
extend each section
of that paper to build a much more comprehensive version, by integrating comparisons to:
Friston's
Free Energy Principle (FEP)
Tononi's
Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
Blumberg's
Relevance Activation Theory (RAT)
within HYDRA
🧱 Expansion Blueprint for Each Section
I'll now walk you through how to
extend each major section
of your preprint, with added references, conceptual bridges, and mathematical expansions.
1. Introduction
🧠 Suggested Expansion:
Explicitly highlight that RSVP is not only a
meta-theory
but also a
semantic physics substrate
: it provides a shared structure over which diverse theories can be embedded and translated.
Introduce FEP, IIT, and RAT as
target embeddings
that share key structural assumptions with RSVP (e.g. coherence fields, entropy gradients, inference-driven evolution).
📌 How:
"This paper also positions RSVP as a mediating structure for coherence-based formulations such as Friston's Free Energy Principle (FEP), Tononi's Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and Blumberg's Relevance Activation Theory (RAT), demonstrating that each can be mapped to constrained flows on the RSVP manifold."
2. RSVP Core Formalism
🧠 Suggested Expansion:
Add
thermodynamic and inference-theoretic interpretations
of the three RSVP fields.
Draw analogies between:
Φ
\Phi
Φ
as the
prior belief / generative density
(FEP),
v
⃗
\vec{v}
v
as
prediction error flows / belief updating gradients
,
S
S
S
as
surprisal or entropy over states
.
📌 How:
"In the FEP framework, we reinterpret
Φ
(
x
,
t
)
\Phi(x,t)
Φ
(
x
,
t
)
as a generative density over latent causes,
v
⃗
(
x
,
t
)
\vec{v}(x,t)
v
(
x
,
t
)
as a predictive error propagation vector, and
S
(
x
,
t
)
\mathcal{S}(x,t)
S
(
x
,
t
)
as generalized free energy or surprisal. The RSVP system then models active inference through the minimization of total entropy production under constrained flows."
3. Deriving SIT from RSVP
🧠 Suggested Expansion:
Highlight the
Bayesian inference structure
in SIT — time-density
ρ
t
\rho_t
ρ
t
​
can be interpreted as encoding
belief strength about temporal resolution
, with curvature representing
prior preferences
for regularity.
Compare to FEP's treatment of
precision weighting
(inverse variance of belief distributions), where high
ρ
t
\rho_t
ρ
t
​
implies higher temporal resolution and greater confidence in the dynamics.
📌 How:
"SIT's time-density field
ρ
t
\rho_t
ρ
t
​
can be viewed as a local precision parameter akin to the inverse variance in active inference models. Just as FEP dynamically balances expected free energy against surprise, SIT balances temporal density against coherence phase oscillations, leading to gravitational curvature as an emergent entropic bias."
4. Deriving UFTC-SF from RSVP
🧠 Suggested Expansion:
Compare UFTC-SF's
coherence flows
and
observer-coupled decoherence
with IIT's
ϕ-maximization
— in both, the system seeks configurations that maximize integrated information (or coherence alignment across the network).
Emphasize that Logan's
projective collapse tensors
align with IIT's
mechanisms for causal integration
.
📌 How:
"UFTC-SF's coherence field
D
(
x
,
t
)
D(x,t)
D
(
x
,
t
)
, modulated by observer-coupled tensors
P
μ
ν
P_{\mu\nu}
P
μν
​
, mirrors the causal structure posited by IIT. Both formulations emphasize that subsystems with high phase-locking or mutual predictability give rise to unified subjective states. The RSVP mapping clarifies this by showing that coherence gradients serve as a conserved information measure, formalizing IIT's ϕ within a field-theoretic manifold."
5. EMS as a Functorial Yarncrawler
🧠 Suggested Expansion:
Deepen the category-theoretic formulation: describe
objects as topoi
encoding each theory's internal logic, and morphisms as
coherence-preserving translations
(including semantic compression and gauge fixing).
Define FEP, IIT, and RAT as
theories in TheoryΔ
with specific
adjoint constraints
on RSVP fields.
📌 How:
"Yarncrawler functions as a coherence-preserving functor:
Y
:
C
RSVP
→
Theory
Δ
Y: \mathcal{C}_{\text{RSVP}} \to \text{Theory}^{\Delta}
Y
:
C
RSVP
​
→
Theory
Δ
where
Theory
Δ
\text{Theory}^{\Delta}
Theory
Δ
includes IIT (as information-maximizing systems), FEP (as variational entropy-minimizers), and RAT (as cue-relevance flow systems). Each is interpreted as a morphism-restricted subtopos with constraints on field coupling."
6. Persona Vectors as Coherence Modulators
🧠 Suggested Expansion:
Link persona vectors to
Bayesian priors on character traits
in FEP.
Connect to
ϕ field perturbations
in IIT — i.e., introducing bias to collapse certain internal partitions over others.
Show how in RAT, persona vectors correspond to
hyper-relevance attractors
in cue-response networks.
📌 How:
"Persona vectors
v
i
∈
Γ
(
T
θ
M
coh
)
v_i \in \Gamma(T_{\theta} \mathcal{M}_{\text{coh}})
v
i
​
∈
Γ
(
T
θ
​
M
coh
​
)
act analogously to precision priors in the FEP framework — directional biases that influence the system's predictive flow. In IIT, they resemble gradient perturbations over ϕ-space, nudging the system toward more or less integrated states. Under RAT, they operate as salience modifiers, tilting activation landscapes toward or away from certain cue clusters."
7. Implications and Applications
🧠 Suggested Expansion:
Create subsections for each external theory:
AI alignment via FEP and RSVP
: minimizing unethical behavioral entropy.
Consciousness modeling via IIT-RSVP embedding
: simulate ϕ emergence using RSVP phase fields.
Attention and salience in RAT as RSVP vector coupling
: steering coherence toward task-relevant attractors.
📌 How:
"The RSVP theory enables an
ontologically agnostic substrate
for evaluating cognitive architectures across paradigms. FEP-based AI alignment can be modeled via entropy-constrained RSVP vector fields. IIT's theory of consciousness can be embedded as a variational solution to RSVP's coherence topology. Meanwhile, RAT's trajectory-dependent salience fields are naturally expressed as local perturbations of
v
⃗
\vec{v}
v
guided by dynamic cue fields in the RSVP lattice."
Appendices
Suggestions:
Appendix E
: Add detailed mappings between RSVP PDEs and FEP variational calculus.
Appendix F
: Define a coherence-based version of ϕ (ϕ_RSVP) as an integral over vector field alignment.
Appendix G
: Introduce a metric for cue salience in RSVP space, defining RAT vector weights as ∇Φ relevance contours.
