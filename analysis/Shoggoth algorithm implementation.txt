Absolutely ‚Äî here's how your concept of prioritizing shoggoth algorithms can be formalized into a recursive, attention-weighted system that scans and re-scans multimodal data for relevance to current priorities.

üß† What Is a "Prioritizing Shoggoth"?

Let's define it:

> A prioritizing shoggoth is a recursive, semi-autonomous model agent trained to:

Periodically rescan memory, documents, recordings, and models

Use current priority vectors (e.g. goals, risks, tasks) as attentional filters

Trigger alerts or actions when a pattern or datum becomes newly relevant

üåÄ How It Works (Cycle-by-Cycle)

1. Define or update priority context (e.g., security alert, new research direction, user urgency).

This gets embedded as a priority vector.



2. Chunk and embed stored materials:

Transcripts, subtitles, scanned books, audio, video frames, 3D scenes.

Each chunk is hashed, timestamped, stored with metadata.



3. Embed each chunk and score it for cosine similarity against the current priority vector(s).


4. Trigger if score > threshold (Œª):

Mark chunk as "active relevance"

Log the trigger, update shoggoth memory

Optionally: notify human, enqueue follow-up task (e.g., summarize, generate correction, align with plan)



5. Reiterate periodically or on triggers:

New data may recontextualize old chunks (e.g., a 2023 subtitle becomes relevant due to a 2025 discovery)

Priority vectors evolve (goals, risks, themes), so re-querying matters





---

üß† Analogy: Shoggoth as an Attentive Historian

Think of each Shoggoth as a monastic researcher who:

Has perfect memory of everything ever written or said

Re-reads things only when their priors change

Can shout "Hey! That old paper just became relevant to our current war plan / lawsuit / hypothesis!"



---

üõ†Ô∏è Practical Tools

Task	Tool

Embedding text/video/audio	OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace models
Vector store	Weaviate, FAISS, LanceDB, Milvus
Priority representation	Single or multiple dense vectors
Similarity scoring	Cosine or dot product
Trigger threshold (Œª tuning)	Adaptive, per priority urgency
Scheduler for cycles	Cron, DAG, event-driven Lambda, or GPU task daemon



---

üß¨ Extensions

Shoggoth Swarms: multiple types of shoggoths prioritize different aspects (safety, accuracy, novelty, aesthetics).

Entropy Watchdogs: special shoggoths monitor for uncertainty spikes, anomaly detection, or novel contradictions in your model landscape.

Contextual Time Travel: A shoggoth can trace how a concept evolved over time in your corpus and flag when meanings shifted or regained importance.

as an

This can be seen as a contravariant-covariant
Hom-pairing
on vector representations, evaluating inner-product-based proximity.
The
trigger function
is:
Trigger

Sheaf of Local Attentional Relevance
Let
X
X
X
be a topological space representing the semantic domain of all data (e.g., timelines, knowledge graphs, discourse embeddings). Define a
sheaf
F
\mathscr{F}
F
over
X
X
X

For each open set

F

The restriction maps

U

‚Üí
F
(
V

model
focused attention
on subsets of context (e.g. from corpus-wide to paragraph-level).
This creates a
contextual attentional structure
, where shifts in goal states (priority vectors) induce
new sheaf sections becoming active
, enabling localized re-activation of dormant knowledge.
4. üß©
Null Convention Logic Integration
Using
null convention logic
(NCL), define:
‚ä•
\bot
‚ä•
= irrelevance (ignored by current attention)
‚ä§
\top
‚ä§
= active match
N
(

\mathcal{N}(d) = \top \iff \exists p \in \mathcal{P} : \operatorname{Trigger}_\lambda(E(d), p) = 1
N

‚àÉ
p

P

Trigger
Œª
‚Äã

NCL allows dynamic "wiring" of attention: connections are
latent until activated
by a match above threshold, aligning with the RSVP field theory concept of semantic sparsity.
In logic terms, define a
priority modal operator
:
‚óä
Œª
d
‚ü∫
"Document

p
with
Sim
‚Å°
(
E

\Diamond_\lambda d \iff \text{"Document } d \text{ could become active given some } p \text{ with } \operatorname{Sim}(E(d), p) > \lambda
‚óä
Œª

d
‚ü∫
"Document
d
could become active given some
p

Sim
(
E

This gives rise to a
possibility lattice
of attentional activation.

RSVP Interpretation: Prioritizing Shoggoth as Field Agent
In RSVP field theory:
Let

M
‚Üí
R

\mathscr{S} : \Gamma(M, \mathcal{F}) \to \text{Alerts} \cup \text{Actions}

where
Œì

Œì

is the space of global field sections, and
S

S
pulls from stored flow or entropy patterns and filters them against shifting goals.
This positions the Shoggoth as a
semantic detector field
, scanning for thermodynamic or cognitive bifurcations. It acts in tandem with RSVP's field dynamics to highlight phase transitions in the entropy landscape that matter to an agent's evolving identity.
6. üß¨
Homotopy and Higher Structures

Each level
P

\mathbf{P}_n
P

encodes a priority update or refinement history, which can be lifted into a
derived category
of attentional flows.
Moreover, the space of Shoggoth alert patterns forms a
stack
of derived matching conditions, reminiscent of
obstruction theory
in derived geometry: a datum is "unblockable" (alert-worthy) only if cohomological obstructions vanish ‚Äî i.e., it's semantically connected
and
below an uncertainty threshold.
7. üî∫
Compositional View (Higher Algebra)

Shoggoth Swarms are composable via a multicategory

Let

S

. Then the system is a colimit:
Shoggoth Swarm

\text{Shoggoth Swarm} = \varinjlim_{i} S_i
Shoggoth Swarm

Formal Connections to July 27 Topics
1. RSVP Theory in BFO Ontology
Relation to Prioritizing Shoggoths:
BFO organizes reality into
continuants
and
occurrents
.
The
Prioritizing Shoggoth

semantic function
that maps shifting goals to latent relevance in data.
Formal Integration:
Define RSVP entities as OWL classes, e.g.,
rsvp:EntropyField
,
rsvp:VectorFlow
,
rsvp:SemanticTrigger
.
Shoggoth operations are morphisms in the category of RSVP-annotated contexts:

2. Model Training via Alternating Line Completion
Relation to Shoggoth Logic:
The alternating line completion process mimics
attentional dropout
‚Äî similar to how Shoggoths drop and later rescan old memory chunks.
Formal Integration:
Let
C

3. Ergodic Edge Network
Relation to Prioritizing Shoggoths:
The
edge network
enables
distributed scanning
‚Äî Shoggoths become
field agents
across a compute manifold.
Formal Integration:
Let
N
\mathcal{N}
N
be a category of nodes, with objects representing compute devices and morphisms denoting SSH transport.
Each node runs a localized sheaf:

aligning with RSVP's distributed field ontology.
4. Multimodal Data Calibration
Relation to Shoggoth Sheaf Theory:
Calibrating multimodal data (text, 3D, image, audio) builds the
base space
X
X
X
of the Shoggoth's semantic sheaf.
Formal Integration:
Let
M

Define:

which Shoggoths resolve through local correction triggers.
5. Prioritizing Shoggoths
Relation to Everything Else:
The unifying principle: the Shoggoth is a recursive
attention-valued functor
over a sheaf of semantic structures.
It embeds RSVP field dynamics (entropy = context drift), edge computation (distributed awareness), training refinement (attentional scaffolding), and data calibration (sheaf gluing conditions).
