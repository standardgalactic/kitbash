Philosophers are making a mistake when they try to tame reality's paradoxes‚Äîwhen they try to make consciousness, free will and the cosmos itself fit neatly within common sense. In fact, when it comes to reality, the one thing we can be certain of, argues philosopher of psychology Eric Schwitzgebel, is that it is deeply weird and contrary to common sense. Attempts to evade this weirdness by, for example, framing everything in terms of scientific materialism, cannot succeed‚Äîfor monsters lurk even within materialism.

 

When it comes to fundamental theories of consciousness and cosmology, common sense fails spectacularly. Every serious theory of the nature of reality and the role of the mind within it is, in some respects, jaw-droppingly bizarre. And where the truth lies, among the various weird possibilities, is beyond our capacity to know‚Äînow and maybe forever.

Maybe you favor materialism: the view that everything is ultimately composed of material stuff‚Äîelementary particles like quarks, electrons, and photons. No immaterial souls that might be reincarnated or ascend to an afterlife. Just carbon-based lifeforms, stitched together from the same basic elements. Humans are just complicated versions of jellyfish, snails, and lizards.

If materialism is true, then consciousness must somehow arise from the complex swirling of matter. Tangle some molecules together just right and‚Äîvoil√†!‚Äîmentality ignites. The clump of matter doesn't just react to stimuli; it sees and hears, it feels pain and pleasure, it wonders and regrets. It dreams of Middle-earth, falls in love via text message, and imagines jet skiing through the clouds. Many of us find it hard to believe that 1028 atoms, appropriately configured, could do all of this‚Äîand thus the perennial temptation to posit a soul in addition to the material body.

SUGGESTED VIEWING
Taking leave of reason
With Joanna Kavenna, Rebecca Roache, Bahar Gholipour, Rory Sutherland

If you have been a scientific materialist long enough, you might be desensitized to this oddity, no longer finding it weird to suppose that a bunch of atoms could be conscious. But pursue the consequences of materialism a little farther, and stranger things follow.

You have a brain. Presumably that's why you're conscious while the 1028 atoms in a mound of swamp grass are (presumably) not conscious. But what is it about brains that makes them so special?

Scientific materialism generally points to properties like the following: the complex processing of huge amounts of information, the ability to guide sophisticated responsiveness to opportunities and threats in the outside environment, and the ability to represent itself and the world‚Äîall embedded in a rich physical and social environment that gives these complex processes meaning.

Is it simply too absurd to suppose that the United States literally has conscious experiences over and above the experiences of its citizens and residents?

___

Humans and other animals aren't the only entities with these properties. Another such entity is the United States. (Did you think I was going to say AI systems? Yes, well, maybe them too, but let's turn a different direction today.)

Imagine you're a planet-sized alien observing Earth. The United States might look like a spatially distributed superorganism, with people as its parts. Each person plays a role, like a liver cell or neuron does in a human body. Now consider: Might this entity have conscious experiences of its own? I mean not just the sum of its members' experiences but something emergent and distinct‚Äîconscious experiences transpiring at the group level, possibly had by no individual human?

Certainly ‚Äî this excerpt from Eric Schwitzgebel's article
"Consciousness, cosmology, and the collapse of common sense"
(published July 30, 2025) is a rich provocation that aligns with many of the themes you've been exploring, especially in RSVP theory and the Yarncrawler framework. Below is a
summary and contextual commentary
that outlines its key moves, intellectual implications, and how you might integrate it into your own work.
üìò
Summary of Key Ideas
1.
The Collapse of Common Sense
Schwitzgebel argues that philosophical and scientific attempts to explain reality often fall back on "common sense" assumptions‚Äîbut reality itself continually violates them. Whether in quantum mechanics, cosmology, or consciousness studies, we confront deep paradoxes and ontological weirdness.
üîπ
"Every serious theory... is jaw-droppingly bizarre."
2.
Materialism and Its Monsters
While scientific materialism dismisses souls and supernatural minds, it doesn't evade weirdness‚Äîit
amplifies
it. If everything is made of atoms, then conscious experience must somehow emerge from their configurations‚Äî"voil√†! mentality ignites"‚Äîa proposition as mystifying as any metaphysical claim.
üîπ
"Tangle some molecules together just right and‚Äîvoil√†!‚Äîmentality ignites."
3.
Weird Emergence: Collective Consciousness
Schwitzgebel invokes the idea of emergent group minds‚Äîlike the United States‚Äîas candidates for consciousness. He frames the nation-state as a "superorganism" with systemic information processing, environmental responsiveness, and internal representation‚Äîkey ingredients in materialist accounts of individual consciousness.
üîπ
"Might this entity have conscious experiences of its own?"
üîç
Contextual Integration with RSVP and Yarncrawler
This article dovetails with your broader philosophical and theoretical work in several ways:
‚òëÔ∏è
Field-Based Emergence and RSVP
Schwitzgebel's thought experiment aligns well with RSVP's scalar (Œ¶), vector (ùíó), and entropy (ùë∫) field framework. In RSVP, consciousness is not restricted to local brain processes but may emerge from coherent field configurations across arbitrary scales. His alien-view framing of the US as a "superorganism" maps onto RSVP's notion of
recursive tiling
and entropic gradient coherence‚Äîe.g., a high-Œ¶ configuration over a vast sociopolitical lattice.
‚òëÔ∏è
Yarncrawler and the Failure of Common Sense
The Yarncrawler Framework, which explores topological recursion, entropic structure, and cross-scale inference, explicitly rejects common-sense realism in favor of structural-functionalism and system-level weirdness. Schwitzgebel's refusal to dismiss the "consciousness of the United States" echoes your call to take
macro-agency
and nonlocal cognition seriously‚Äîwithout requiring traditional neural substrates.
‚òëÔ∏è
Philosophical Skepticism & Aletheia Collapse
This also intersects beautifully with your categorization of philosophical skepticism (justificatory, Gettier, noetic, aletheia). Schwitzgebel seems to argue from an
aletheia skepticism
position: we cannot even assume that "truth" must conform to common-sense or sensory-intuitive reality.
