Media Quines and the RSVP Manifold: Modality Reconstruction
via Semantic Field Coherence

July 2025
Abstract
We introduce Media Quines, cross-modal inferential systems that reconstruct absent me-
dia dimensions (e.g., narration from visuals, visuals from transcripts) through semantically
coherent projections. These systems are grounded in the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum
(RSVP) framework, which models information as a manifold of coupled scalar (Φ), vector
(⃗⊑), and entropy (S) fields. Media Quines are formalized as modality-specific projection-
inverse operators on RSVP field slices, constrained by field coherence and minimal semantic
torsion. This approach challenges narratological compression, enabling modality-agnostic
reconstructions and epistemic auditability across perceptual forms. We provide a compre-
hensive theoretical foundation, detailed mathematical formulations, and empirical strategies
for implementation, bridging geometric deep learning, human-computer interaction, and me-
dia philosophy.

Introduction
Modern media artifacts, such as films, podcasts, audiobooks, and transcripts, are typically
constrained to a single modality and consumed as linear narratives. This imposes significant
limitations: it excludes users with differing cognitive or sensory needs and enforces a uni-
directional compression of meaning, reducing the richness of semantic structures to a single
perceptual channel. To address these challenges, we propose Media Quines—semantic systems
that regenerate consistent representations across modalities, grounded in the Relativistic Scalar
Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory. RSVP conceptualizes information, perception, and cognition
as structured field configurations over scalar, vector, and entropy fields, inspired by differential
geometry and thermodynamic principles (6). Media artifacts are treated as partial projections
of a higher-dimensional semantic manifold, and Media Quines are operations that restore latent
structure through coherent projection inversion.
This framework builds on and extends prior work in geometric deep learning (1), embodied AI
(2), and media theory (3; 4). By formalizing modality transformation as a functorial operation
over a structured manifold, we enable transformations that preserve semantic topology rather
than merely sequential content. Additionally, by quantifying narrative divergence as semantic
torsion, we provide a measurable signal for epistemic distortion, applicable to accessibility, AI
interpretability, and media analysis. This paper presents a rigorous mathematical formulation,
empirical implementation strategies, and illustrative diagrams to support the development and
evaluation of Media Quines.

The RSVP Semantic Manifold
The RSVP manifold is a structured representation of semantic information, defined as a tuple
of fields over an n-dimensional semantic space:
FRSVP :=

Φ : Rn →R,
⃗⊑: Rn →Rn,
S : Rn →R

where:
• Φ is the scalar semantic potential, capturing the density or intensity of conceptual meaning
at each point in the semantic space.
• ⃗⊑represents the directed semantic flow or inference vectors, encoding relational dynamics
and directional dependencies between concepts.
• S encodes semantic entropy, quantifying the degree of contextual ambiguity or information
degeneracy.
The RSVP manifold draws inspiration from fiber bundle constructions in differential geometry
(6), where the semantic space serves as the base manifold, and modalities (e.g., visual, auditory,
textual) are sections over this base. A media artifact in modality µ is a projection:
Mµ := πµ(FRSVP)
where πµ : FRSVP →Mµ is a modality-specific projection operator mapping the full manifold to
a modality-specific subspace Mµ. The projection operator πµ can be thought of as a restriction
of the field dynamics to a lower-dimensional representation, analogous to a projection in a
principal bundle.
To formalize the dynamics of the RSVP manifold, we introduce a metric tensor gµν that defines
the geometry of the semantic space. The metric governs the interactions between the scalar,
vector, and entropy fields:
gµν = ∂µΦ∂νΦ + ⟨⃗⊑µ, ⃗⊑ν⟩+ αSδµν
where α is a coupling constant balancing the contribution of entropy, and δµν is the Kronecker
delta. This metric ensures that semantic distances are measured in a way that accounts for
both conceptual density and contextual uncertainty.

Media Quines as Inverse Projective Operators
A Media Quine is a cross-modal transformation that reconstructs a target modality ν from a
source modality µ:
Qµ→ν : πµ(FRSVP) →˜πν(FRSVP)
where ˜πν is an inferred approximation of the true projection πν.
The goal is to minimize
the semantic divergence between the source and reconstructed modalities, formalized as a loss
functional:
LQ = min
˜
Mν
Dsemantic (πµ(FRSVP), ˜πν(FRSVP))
2

We propose using the Wasserstein-2 distance as Dsemantic, which measures the optimal transport
cost between distributions in the latent semantic space (7). For two modality representations
Mµ and ˜
Mν, the Wasserstein-2 distance is:
W2(Mµ, ˜
Mν) =
 
inf
γ∈Π(Mµ, ˜
Mν)
Z
c(x, y)2dγ(x, y)
!1/2
where Π(Mµ, ˜
Mν) is the set of couplings between the distributions, and c(x, y) is a cost function
(e.g., Euclidean distance in the latent space).
The reconstruction is constrained by the RSVP field dynamics, ensuring coherence across the
scalar, vector, and entropy fields:
dΦ + ι⃗⊑ω ≈δS
where ω is a differential form encoding semantic structure, and ι⃗⊑is the interior product with
the vector field. To enforce this constraint, we formulate a Lagrangian optimization problem:
L = Dsemantic(Mµ, ˜
Mν) + λ
dΦ + ι⃗⊑ω −δS

where λ is a Lagrange multiplier. This optimization ensures that the reconstructed modality
respects the underlying semantic topology while minimizing divergence.

Symmetry Breaking and Semantic Torsion
Narrative media induce symmetry breaking by collapsing the RSVP manifold into a linear
trajectory within a single modality, reducing the multidimensional semantic structure to a con-
strained representation. This introduces semantic torsion, a measure of misalignment between
modalities:
Tµν := ∇µ⊑ν −∇ν⊑µ
Torsion quantifies the non-commutativity of semantic flow across modalities, reflecting dis-
tortions such as narrative bias or information loss. In computational terms, torsion can be
estimated using cosine distances in embedding spaces (e.g., CLIP (8)):
Tµν ≈1 −cos(θµν) = 1 −⟨⃗zµ,⃗zν⟩
∥⃗zµ∥∥⃗zν∥
where ⃗zµ,⃗zν are latent embeddings of modalities µ and ν. High torsion indicates significant
modality-specific compression, deviating from the underlying semantic topology.
To further formalize torsion, we define a torsion tensor field over the RSVP manifold:
T ρ
µν = ∂µ⊑ρ
ν −∂ν⊑ρ
µ + Γρ
µσ⊑σ
ν −Γρ
νσ⊑σ
µ
where Γρ
µσ are the Christoffel symbols of the metric gµν. This tensor captures the curvature-
induced distortions in semantic flow, providing a geometric interpretation of narrative misalign-
ment.

Applications
5.1
Accessibility
Media Quines enable modality-agnostic interfaces, allowing users to access media in their pre-
ferred sensory or cognitive modality while preserving semantic integrity. For example, a video
can be transformed into a transcript or graphic novel, enhancing accessibility for visually or
hearing-impaired users. This aligns with universal design principles in human-computer inter-
action (15).

AI and Latent Field Folding
In AI systems, Media Quines fold latent semantic fields into expressive forms, enabling cross-
modal consistency checks. This supports interpretable reasoning and modality-aware memory,
aligning with embodied AI paradigms (2). For instance, a Media Quine can reconstruct a visual
scene from a textual description, ensuring consistency with the underlying semantic manifold.
5.3
Epistemic Auditability
Media Quines facilitate semantic triangulation across modalities, detecting discrepancies as field
misalignments or increased torsion. This is particularly valuable in journalism, education, and
science communication, where narrative bias can be quantified and audited (5). For example,
discrepancies between a news video and its transcript can be flagged as regions of high torsion,
indicating potential bias or editorial manipulation.

Empirical Implementation
We outline a proof-of-concept for Media Quines using multimodal machine learning:
• Speech-to-Text: Use OpenAI Whisper (9) for robust audio-to-text conversion, leveraging
its ability to handle diverse audio inputs.
• Multimodal Alignment: Use CLIP (8) or FLAVA (10) to align latent representations
across modalities, ensuring semantic consistency.
• Torsion Estimation: Compute cosine distances in embedding spaces to estimate Tµν, pro-
viding a practical metric for modality misalignment.
• Output Generation: Render reconstructed modalities in HTML+SVG (e.g., for graphic
novel formats), audio, or text, using tools like D3.js for visualization.
6.1
Benchmark Datasets
We propose evaluating Media Quines on datasets with multimodal triplets:
• LibriSpeech (11): Audio and transcripts for speech-to-text evaluation.
• YouCook2 (12): Video, audio, and text instructions for procedural content.
• TVQA (13): Video and question-answer pairs for visual-text alignment.
• HowTo100M (14): Instructional videos with narrations for large-scale multimodal analysis.
Ablation studies can remove one modality (e.g., audio) and evaluate reconstruction fidelity
using Wasserstein-2 distance and torsion metrics. For example, reconstructing a video's visual
4

content from its audio narration can be evaluated by comparing the reconstructed visuals to
the original using CLIP embeddings.

Discussion
Media Quines reframe media as reconstructable semantic manifolds, challenging the linear,
modality-specific paradigms of traditional media. By grounding transformations in RSVP dy-
namics, they ensure topological preservation of meaning, addressing limitations in accessibility,
AI interpretability, and epistemic auditability. The framework draws on post-structural me-
dia theory (4; 3), which critiques the flattening of meaning in modern media, and extends it
through a computational lens. The use of torsion as a metric for narrative distortion offers a
novel approach to quantifying bias, with potential applications in media forensics and ethical
AI.
Future work includes:
• Developing eﬀicient algorithms for torsion computation in high-dimensional spaces, pos-
sibly leveraging approximate methods like Sinkhorn divergences (7).
• Integrating Media Quines into real-time accessibility platforms, such as browser extensions
for on-the-fly modality conversion.
• Exploring applications in education, where cross-modal reconstructions can enhance learn-
ing by adapting content to diverse learner needs.

Conclusion
Media Quines operationalize the RSVP framework's commitments to coherence, projectional
symmetry, and entropy-aware structure. They shift the ontological status of media from static
narratives to dynamic, reconstructable manifolds, enabling modality-transcendent epistemics.
In a culture dominated by compressive storytelling and memetic acceleration, Media Quines
provide a formal and empirical pathway to preserve the integrity of meaning across perceptual
forms, offering a foundation for accessible, interpretable, and auditable media systems.
