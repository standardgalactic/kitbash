capturing recursive semantic transformations.

Historical Context
Geometric Roots: Builds on Thurston's foliations [?] and Needham's visual complex analysis [?].
Epistemic Geometry: Models knowledge as flows on a manifold, extending geometric methods to
cognitive and cultural systems.
Novel Concepts:
Cultural Curvature: Torsion in Θ(N) measures semantic divergence.
Attractor Thermodynamics: Entropy weights wk control cognitive stability.
Interdisciplinary Relevance: Connects differential geometry, cognitive science, and AI, addressing
problems like semantic drift and model alignment.

Mathematical Framework: RSVP Local Chart
Definition 2.1
Let M be a smooth n-dimensional manifold (epistemic space). Define:
Scalar field Φ : M →R (semantic salience).
Vector field ⃗v : M →TM (conceptual velocity).
Entropy field S : M →R+ (cognitive uncertainty).
Purpose: Generalizes field theories to epistemic contexts, modeling knowledge dynamics as geometric
flows.
Connection: Aligns with cognitive theories (e.g., Hofstadter's analogy [?]) and geometric deep learning.

RSVP Amplitwist Operator
Definition
The RSVP Amplitwist A ∈C encodes local epistemic phase alignment:
A(⃗x) = ∥⃗v(⃗x)∥· exp
(
i · arccos
(
⃗v(⃗x) · ∇Φ(⃗x)
∥⃗v(⃗x)∥∥∇Φ(⃗x)∥+ ε
))
,
where ε > 0 ensures numerical stability, and θ(⃗x) is the phase angle.
Extension: Generalizes Needham's 2D amplitwist to n-dimensional manifolds.
Interpretation: Captures magnitude and alignment of conceptual velocity with semantic gradients.

Recursive Semantic Layers
Definition 2.2
A semantic deformation layer Rk induces epistemic torsion:
Rk(⃗x) = ⃗x +
k
∑
j=1
ϵjTj(⃗x),
Tj ∈so(n).
The layer-k amplitwist is:
A(k)(⃗x) = wk(⃗x) · A(Rk(⃗x)),
wk(⃗x) = exp(−λS(⃗x)).
Mechanism: Models hierarchical transformations (e.g., cognitive, social, cultural) via Lie group actions.
Significance: Enables recursive analysis of knowledge propagation across scales.

Visualization: Amplitwist Cascade
Figure: Cascade of amplitwist fields across layers R1 (primal cognition), R2 (social interaction), R3 (cultural
scaffolding). Color gradients show |A(k)|.
Simulation Output: Three-layer amplitwist magnitudes for Φ(x, y) = x2 + y2, ⃗v(x, y) = (−y, x).
Insight: Visualizes recursive epistemic transformations and attractor formation.

Key Theorems
Theorem 3.1: Attractor Stability
For an N-layer system with ϵj < ϵcrit, the vorticity ξ(N) converges:
lim
N→∞ξ(N) ≤
C
Vol(M)
∫
M
∥∇× TN(⃗x)∥d⃗x.
Theorem 3.2: Eﬀiciency Bound
The epistemic eﬀiciency ratio η(N) satisfies:
η(N) ≥
λ1(M)
N · maxj ∥ϵjTj∥∞
.
Implications: Ensure stability and quantify alignment costs in epistemic systems.

Application: Linguistic Evolution
Model: Linguistic change as a cascade of transformations:
R1: Phonetic drift (T1 = vowel shift).
R2: Grammaticalization (T2 = aspect-to-tense).
R3: Semantic bleaching (T3 = metaphor decay).
