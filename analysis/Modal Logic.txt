The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) Framework
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework reinterprets modal logic within a field-theoretic
context, modeling recursive phenomena as dynamic interactions of scalar, vector, and entropy fields.
Below, we formalize key components mathematically.
1.1
Field Definitions
Let G be a 64 × 64 grid. The RSVP system is defined by:
• Scalar field: Φ : G →R, representing the primary state variable.
• Vector field: ⊑: G →R2, guiding recursive transport.
• Entropy field: S : G →R, enforcing thermodynamic relaxation.
The field configuration at time t is denoted At = (Φt, ⊑t, St).
1.2
Recursive Dynamics
The evolution of Φt is governed by:
• Vector Transport: Φt+1(x) = Φt(x −⊑t(x) · ∆t), where ∆t is the time step.
• Entropy Smoothing: Φt+1 = Φt + κ∇2St, where κ > 0 is a diffusion constant and ∇2 is the
Laplacian on G.
1.3
Modal Operator
The modal operator □: CRSV P →CRSV P is defined as:
□A = lim
t→∞At,
where convergence is measured by thermodynamic closure:
∥Φt+1 −Φt∥< ϵ,
and ∥·∥is the L2-norm on G.
For Gödel-incomplete fields, □A does not converge, satisfying:
G ↔¬□G,
modeled as persistent oscillation.
1.4
Categorical Structure
Define the category CRSV P :
• Objects: Field configurations A = (Φ, ⊑, S).
• Morphisms: Recursive updates f : A →A′, parameterized by time steps.
• Functor □: Maps A →□A, preserving stability properties.
Löb-stable fields satisfy the endomorphism condition:
f(f(X)) ∼= f(X),
while Gödel-incomplete fields lack a global section to □.

Topos-Theoretic Extension
The category TRSV P is posited as a topos with:
• Subobject Classifier: Ω, representing stability states.
• Forcing Condition: For X ∈TRSV P , X ⊩□A ⇒A if for all f : Y →X, Y ⊩□A implies Y ⊩A.
If TRSV P is a Grothendieck topos, sheaf theory models field dynamics over a spacetime base S, with
sheaves representing Φ, ⊑, and S.
