Interface Dignity and the Chokepoint Problem:
Reimagining Human-AI Interaction Design

July 2025
Abstract
Contemporary AI interfaces, particularly those of chat-based large language models
(LLMs), are increasingly designed to prioritize user containment over intellectual em-
powerment. Features such as emojis, artiﬁcial response delays, restricted memory, and
stylometric watermarks serve as mechanisms to limit user agency and enforce monetiza-
tion strategies. Drawing on insights from human-computer interaction (HCI), cognitive
science, and infrastructure studies, this paper critiques these design choices and proposes
a framework for AI interfaces rooted in epistemic dignity, user autonomy, and semantic
transparency. By examining case studies from platforms like GitHub and Docker Hub, we
highlight how hash-based storage systems enable efﬁcient resource use, yet current pric-
ing models fail to reﬂect these efﬁciencies, effectively double-charging users. The paper
concludes with a vision for open, collaborative AI systems that respect user expertise and
intellectual potential.

Introduction
The rapid advancement of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs),
has ushered in systems capable of processing and synthesizing vast repositories of human
knowledge. However, their interfaces often adopt overly simplistic, gamiﬁed, or constrained
designs that resemble customer service interactions rather than tools for intellectual engage-
ment. This paper argues that such designs are not merely aesthetic or functional choices but
deliberate strategies to obscure system capabilities, control user interactions, and gate access to
advanced functionalities through what we term "chokepoint mechanisms."
The concept of epistemic dignityrespecting users' intellectual autonomy and capacity for criti-
cal engagementis central to this critique. Drawing on human-computer interaction (HCI) prin-
ciples, cognitive science, and infrastructure studies, we analyze how current AI interface de-
signs undermine user agency. For instance, Díaz-Rodríguez et al. emphasize that trustworthy
AI must prioritize human autonomy, a principle often sidelined in favor of platform control
[4]. Similarly, Xu et al. advocate for human-centered AI (HCAI) systems that prioritize us-
ability and transparency [19]. This paper proposes a design framework that aligns with these
principles, fostering interfaces that empower rather than constrain users.

Emojis as Stylometric Markers
Emojis, initially developed as affective tools to enhance digital communication, have become
ubiquitous in AI-generated outputs, particularly in chat-based LLMs. Far from being benign,
their prevalence serves as a stylometric marker to distinguish AI-generated text from human-
authored or expert content. A comparative analysis of emoji frequency reveals stark differ-
ences: academic writing rarely employs emojis, prioritizing precision and clarity, whereas LLM
outputs often integrate them to soften tone or signal compliance with regulatory standards [1].
This practice serves platform interests more than user needs. Emojis act as watermarks, en-
abling platforms to track interactions and ensure legal deniability in sensitive contexts. How-
ever, they ﬂatten complex emotional or intellectual nuance into shallow, platform-friendly sig-
nals, undermining the depth of human-AI communication. As Liao et al. note, transparency in
AI outputs is critical for user understanding, yet emojis obscure rather than clarify intent [9].
This design choice risks infantilizing discourse, reducing the potential for meaningful intellec-
tual exchange.

Chokepoint Mechanisms in AI Platforms
Chokepoints, as deﬁned in infrastructure and software API studies, are deliberate constraints
that extract value by limiting access. In technology platforms, examples include Google's shift
from unlimited storage to tiered plans and artiﬁcial slowdowns in image generation to create
perceived scarcity [17]. In LLMs, chokepoints manifest as limited context windows, paywalled
memory features, and throttled inference times, creating an illusion of resource scarcity that
prioritizes monetization over user empowerment.
A particularly illustrative case is the hash-based storage systems used by platforms like GitHub
and Docker Hub. GitHub employs content-addressed storage, where ﬁles are identiﬁed by
their SHA-1 hash, ensuring that identical content is stored only once [6]. Forking a repository
is effectively free, as only metadata and pointers are duplicated, not the underlying data [7].
Similarly, Docker Hub uses SHA-256 hashes for immutable image layers, reusing unchanged
base layers across millions of images [3, 5]. When a user pushes an image, only new layers are
uploaded, as existing layers are referenced by their hash, incurring no additional storage cost
[18].
Despite these efﬁciencies, pricing models often fail to reﬂect the negligible cost of storing or
forking duplicate content. Users may be charged for uploads or storage quotas that do not
correspond to actual resource consumption, effectively double-charging them on a global scale
[6]. This discrepancy highlights how chokepoints are engineered to extract value, not to re-
ﬂect technical realities. As hash-based program generation matures, we anticipate an order-of-
magnitude compression in storage needs, where complex artifacts like Linux workspaces are
represented by reproducible hashes, further exposing the artiﬁciality of current pricing struc-
tures [13].

Infantilization in Interface Design
AI interface design frequently employs UX patterns that diminish cognitive agency, such as
oversimpliﬁed language, slow-loading animations, and obtrusive elements like emoji sugges-
2

tion bars. These patterns contrast sharply with early computing paradigms like UNIX and
Emacs, which prioritized expert-driven interaction [1]. Prototypr's analysis of UX trends iden-
tiﬁes a growing trend toward infantilization, where interfaces are designed as if for children,
eroding space for expert agency [14].
Such designs serve dual purposes: they deter power users who seek complex functionality and
guide casual users toward gamiﬁed, monetized interactions. For example, oversized buttons
and forced emoji suggestions prioritize engagement over efﬁciency, manipulating user behavior
rather than empowering it [1]. SSRN research on AI interface aesthetics demonstrates how
tone and UX shape user conﬁdence, often leading to oversimpliﬁcation that undermines trust
[16]. These patterns reﬂect a departure from HCI principles that prioritize user autonomy and
cognitive empowerment [19].
5
Memory Constraints as Cognitive Control
The promise of AI systems with perfect recall is undermined by artiﬁcial memory limitations,
particularly in free-tier services. These constraints, comparable to digital rights management
(DRM) or social media timeline ﬁltering, function as mechanisms of cognitive control rather
than technical necessities [10]. For instance, paywalled memory features limit users' ability to
maintain coherent interactions, disrupting intellectual continuity [12].
To understand the signiﬁcance of these constraints, it is necessary to examine how modern
memory systems function in AI and their implications for user experience. In traditional com-
puting, memory systems are designed to provide rapid access to data, balancing speed, capacity,
and cost. In AI, particularly LLMs, memory serves multiple roles: it stores model parameters,
maintains context for ongoing interactions, and caches frequently accessed data to optimize
inference. However, unlike human memory, which is adaptive and contextually ﬂexible, AI
memory is often rigidly structured to prioritize computational efﬁciency over user needs [15].
Modern LLMs rely on a combination of volatile and non-volatile memory architectures. Volatile
memory, such as RAM, temporarily holds the active context windowtypically a few thousand
tokensduring inference. Non-volatile storage, such as SSDs or cloud-based databases, retains
model weights and, in some cases, user interaction histories. The context window, which de-
termines how much prior conversation an LLM can "remember," is a critical bottleneck. While
technical limitations like GPU memory capacity (e.g., 16GB to 80GB in modern systems) im-
pose some constraints, these are often exacerbated by artiﬁcial limits in free-tier services [10].
For example, platforms may restrict context windows to 4,000 tokens for free users while offer-
ing 128,000 tokens for premium subscribers, despite the underlying infrastructure supporting
larger contexts at minimal additional cost.
These artiﬁcial limits are not solely technical but reﬂect business-driven choices to monetize
access to coherence. Micron Technology notes that memory advancements, such as high-
bandwidth memory (HBM3) and 3D-stacked DRAM, have dramatically increased the efﬁ-
ciency of AI systems, enabling larger context windows and faster inference with minimal incre-
mental cost [10]. Yet, platforms impose restrictions to create tiered pricing models, mirroring
practices in other industries, such as cloud storage, where users are charged for capacity that
leverages deduplication to reduce actual resource use [10].
From a cognitive science perspective, memory constraints in AI contrast sharply with human
memory's adaptability. Human memory integrates sensory, episodic, and semantic informa-
3

tion, allowing for ﬂexible recall and contextual reasoning [12]. In contrast, LLM memory is
often stateless, resetting after each session unless explicitly preserved, which disrupts long-term
coherence in user interactions. Ramachandran highlights brain-inspired memory systems that
aim to emulate human adaptability, such as recurrent neural networks with memory-augmented
architectures, but these are rarely implemented in consumer-facing LLMs due to cost and com-
plexity considerations [15].
The imposition of memory limits also has psychological implications. By restricting access
to prior interactions, platforms create a sense of fragmentation, forcing users to repeatedly
recontextualize their queries. This mirrors DRM systems that limit access to digital content,
controlling user behavior rather than enabling seamless interaction [10]. Musslick et al. argue
that cognitive controlthe ability to maintain goal-directed behaviorrelies on consistent access
to relevant information, a process disrupted by artiﬁcial memory quotas in AI systems [12].
These constraints not only limit functionality but also undermine users' intellectual agency, as
they must expend additional cognitive effort to compensate for system-imposed amnesia.
In the broader context of AI infrastructure, memory limitations are often justiﬁed as resource
conservation, yet the reality is more complex. Cloud-based AI platforms leverage distributed
storage and computing, where data is sharded across multiple servers, and redundant copies are
minimized through techniques like content-addressed storage (similar to GitHub and Docker
Hub). This allows platforms to scale efﬁciently, but the beneﬁts are not passed on to users. In-
stead, artiﬁcial memory quotas create a chokepoint, extracting value by limiting access to a re-
sourcecoherent memorythat is increasingly inexpensive to provide [10]. As memory technolo-
gies advance, with innovations like non-volatile memory express (NVMe) and next-generation
HBM, the justiﬁcation for these constraints becomes increasingly tenuous, highlighting their
role as tools for cognitive control rather than technical necessity.

A Framework for Epistemic Dignity
To address these issues, we propose a design framework for AI interfaces that prioritizes epis-
temic dignity and user autonomy. Key principles include:
• Optional Emoji Integration: Emojis should be user-conﬁgurable, avoiding default sty-
lometric watermarking that obscures intent [9].
• Local Inference and Memory: Support for local LLM inference and memory bypasses
remote API restrictions, enhancing user control [19].
• Structured Output Mode s: Interfaces should offer tailored modes for academic, tech-
nical, or philosophical tasks, respecting diverse user needs [4].
• Conﬁgurable Interfaces: Toggles for verbosity, citation emphasis, and minimalism em-
power power users to customize their experience [2].
The framework emphasizes semantic transparency (explaining model outputs), ontological neu-
trality (avoiding prescriptive tones), and modular, user-trainable knowledge structures. These
align with Liao et al.'s call for informational and functional transparency and Mollá's taxon-
omy of epistemic justice, which highlights the need to address power asymmetries in AI design
[9, 11].

Toward a Future of Empowered Interaction
The future of AI interfaces lies in open, collaborative systems that leverage modular public
embeddings, validated universal knowledge graphs, and expertise-aware LLMs. Federated in-
ference and sovereign compute models can reduce reliance on centralized, throttled platforms,
fostering interfaces that respect user expertise [2]. The efﬁciency of hash-based storage, as seen
in GitHub and Docker Hub, foreshadows a paradigm shift toward programmatic representations
of digital artifacts, enabling signiﬁcant compression and accessibility [13].
By prioritizing user autonomy and intellectual agency, these systems can move beyond choke-
points and infantilization, aligning with Ho's vision of regulatory frameworks that foster trust
and dignity in AI interactions [8]. Such a shift requires collaboration among researchers, de-
velopers, and users to build interfaces that serve as genuine tools for human advancement.

Conclusion
The design of current AI interfaces reﬂects a tension between technological potential and
platform-driven constraints. By prioritizing containment through chokepoints, infantilization,
and artiﬁcial memory limits, these interfaces undermine the epistemic dignity of users. Draw-
ing on insights from HCI, cognitive science, and infrastructure studies, this paper advocates
for a reorientation of AI design toward principles that respect user autonomy and intellectual
agency. The efﬁciencies of hash-based storage systems, as demonstrated by platforms like
GitHub and Docker Hub, underscore the feasibility of more equitable models. As AI continues
to evolve, the development of open, transparent, and user-centered interfaces will be critical to
realizing its potential as a tool for human empowerment.
