Chokepoint Capitalism in Knowledge Infrastructures:
An RSVP-Theoretic Analysis
Flyxion
September 23, 2025
Abstract
This essay examines chokepoint capitalism as a mechanism for restricting knowledge di-
versity across digital, physical, and cultural infrastructures, using an RSVP-theoretic frame-
work enriched with category and sheaf theory. Through cases spanning mobile operating
systems, festival economics, visa policies, AI research platforms, and the historical evo-
lution of alphabetic systems, I argue that chokepoints misprice epistemic diversity by en-
forcing premature evaluation, reducing negentropic potential. A functional paradigm of de-
ferred automation, modeled as a monadic lazy-evaluation regime, is proposed as a counter-
strategy, with the Arabic script's morphological generators serving as a computational ex-
emplar. Mathematical formalisms are oﬀered not only to populate abstract registers but also
to critique the cultural fetish for mathematical authority, with natural-language translations
provided for accessibility.

Introduction
Chokepoint capitalism, as articulated by Giblin and Doctorow [2022], describes economic struc-
tures where gatekeepers control access to markets, extracting rents while suppressing alternatives.
This essay extends the concept to knowledge infrastructures, arguing that chokepoints—whether
in digital platforms, physical events, immigration policies, or historical script evolution—system-
atically undervalue viewpoint diversity, a critical driver of epistemic resilience. Using the RSVP
framework, where scalar capacity (Φ), vector ﬂows (v), and entropy (S) model system dynamics,
I demonstrate how such restrictions function as right-adjoint ﬁlters that collapse diversity colim-
its. A functional paradigm of deferred evaluation, inspired by lazy computation, is proposed to
preserve negentropic potential, with the Arabic script's morphology as a computational case study.

Chokepoint Capitalism as Knowledge Restriction
2.1
Digital Platforms
Mobile operating systems (Android, iOS) impose chokepoints by restricting system-level cus-
tomization (e.g., fonts, terminals). For instance, Samsung's theme economy licenses font design
as a scarce privilege, akin to a lottery, while Android's "Always use this app" prompt enforces pre-
mature defaults, creating hysteresis that discourages exploration of alternatives [Doctorow, 2020].
These design choices function as economic and epistemic tollbooths: they diminish the range
of feasible pathways by privileging a narrow set of defaults and excluding unapproved alternatives.
1

In RSVP terms, the scalar capacity (Φ) of possible user conﬁgurations is artiﬁcially constrained;
vector ﬂows (v) of exploration are collapsed into channels sanctioned by platform gatekeepers; and
entropy (S), which would normally measure the richness of heterogeneity across the user base, is
suppressed into homogenized usage patterns.
This dynamic mirrors the rent-seeking structure of chokepoint capitalism more broadly: the
ecosystem is portrayed as open and diverse, yet the underlying infrastructure routes all innovation
through bottleneck interfaces. Once defaults are entrenched, users face high switching costs—a
form of enforced eager evaluation, where possibilities are collapsed before exploration can occur.
The system extracts value not by producing novelty but by restricting its circulation, reducing
epistemic diversity while monetizing access.
2.2
Physical Analogues
At festivals, organizers charge vendors exorbitant fees for exclusivity, policing independent sellers
to maintain artiﬁcial scarcity. This mirrors digital chokepoints: access is monetized, and diversity
(of vendors or ideas) is suppressed [Giblin and Doctorow, 2022]. Such practices transform what
could be open commons of exchange into curated monocultures, where the cost of entry ﬁlters
out all but the most capitalized participants.
The festival economy illustrates a broader structural logic: rather than maximizing serendipity
and heterogeneity of encounters, organizers constrain ﬂows through tollbooths. In RSVP-theoretic
terms, scalar capacity (Φ) is artiﬁcially reduced—the potential number of feasible vendors is far
greater than those admitted—while vector ﬂows (v) are redirected through exclusive contracts and
patrols. The entropy term (S), which would normally reﬂect distributed novelty and diversity, is
collapsed into a handful of predictable oﬀerings.
This is not unique to cultural festivals. Analogous patterns can be found in farmers' markets
that restrict "non-certiﬁed" growers, in concert venues where only corporate sponsors are allowed
to vend, and in academic conferences where publication or registration fees function as economic
ﬁlters. In each case, chokepoints are rationalized as quality-control mechanisms but function
primarily as revenue streams.
The lesson for knowledge infrastructures is that physical chokepoints habituate participants to
constrained choice and normalize the extraction of rents for access. Just as mobile platforms shape
user expectations of defaults and exclusivity, so too do festivals and markets encode scarcity as
the condition of participation, narrowing the epistemic and cultural diversity that might otherwise
emerge.
2.3
State-Level Chokepoints
The U.S. H-1B visa fee of $100,000, implemented on September 20, 2025, restricts labor mo-
bility, mispricing the epistemic value of diverse perspectives from high-population countries like
India and China [CBC News, 2025]. The policy, signed by President Donald Trump, applies only
to new applicants and has sparked confusion, with the White House clarifying it does not aﬀect
current holders or renewals. Over 70 percent of H-1B holders are from India, and the policy
has been denounced by India's Ministry of External Aﬀairs for potential humanitarian disruptions
to families. Critics argue it undercuts American workers by favoring lower-wage foreign hires,
ignoring their role as negentropic ampliﬁers [CBC News, 2025].

2.4
AI Research Platforms
In traditional scientiﬁc practice, research institutions incur the costs of experimentation and then
disseminate their results for public beneﬁt. By contrast, AI companies invert this model: they
charge end users for the privilege of stress-testing frontier models, eﬀectively outsourcing valida-
tion and adversarial probing to the very communities that would once have been compensated as
research contractors. This inversion transforms a public good into a chokepoint, where access to
the means of knowledge production is tolled.
The economic magnitude of this inversion is striking. One leading ﬁrm has been estimated
to capture on the order of $15 trillion in negentropic value through systematic harvesting of user
interactions—value that would otherwise require decades of distributed research labor and for-
mal veriﬁcation. Yet the actual costs borne by the company are comparatively marginal: the
infrastructure to run inference, modest researcher oversight, and cloud-level compute provision-
ing. The epistemic surplus—error modes uncovered, domain knowledge stress-tested, and cross-
disciplinary insights generated—is eﬀectively appropriated under platform lock-in.
Within RSVP terms, this arrangement can be modeled as a diversion of entropy ﬂux (S):
instead of dissipating across a heterogeneous network of institutions, S is concentrated through a
narrow vector ﬂow (v) controlled by a single gatekeeper. Scalar capacity (Φ), understood as the
informational reservoir of humanity, is thus undervalued by design, since diversity of probes and
contexts is only recognized insofar as it accrues to the platform's private valuation.
From a functional programming perspective, this is premature forcing at scale: the epistemic
pipeline is evaluated inside the company's monad rather than being deferred across the global
research community. The result is a systematic mispricing of viewpoint diversity: alternative
interpretations, adversarial probes, and localized knowledge are reduced to training tokens rather
than preserved as distinct amalgams. Entropic futarchy (Appendix B) would predict precisely this
inequality: the colimit of all possible probes is richer than the restricted subpresheaf permitted by
corporate chokepoints.

Alphabetic Evolution as Historical Chokepoints
The evolution of Phoenician into Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, and Latin scripts illustrates chokepoint
dynamics in cultural infrastructures. Phoenician's consonantal script was a high-entropy substrate,
allowing lazy evaluation across cultures. Greek and Latin enforced eager vowelization, reducing
ambiguity but creating tears in gluable diversity, while Hebrew and Arabic deferred vocalization,
preserving combinatorial richness.
4
Arabic Script as Computational Assembler
The Arabic script exempliﬁes a computational generator system, analogous to an assembler in
low-level programming. Consonants function as base instructions (generators), with vowels (َ,
ِ, ُ) and sukūn as arguments that instantiate syllables, and morphological measures (Forms I-X)
as higher-order transformations that derive semantic ﬁelds from roots. This structure mirrors
lazy evaluation: roots remain symbolic until context or diacritics force realization, maximizing
interpretive potential. Unlike Greek's early vowel commitment, Arabic's deferred system supports
a high-entropy lexical colimit, which I formalize as a monadic regime in Appendix D.

Counter-Strategy: Deferred Evaluation as Futarchy
Deferring automation—whether in knowledge pipelines, app defaults, or script evolution—pre-
serves epistemic diversity. Modeled as a monad in the RSVP category, this strategy delays forcing
until colimits of local sections (drafts, app choices, cultural adaptations) are explored, maximizing
negentropic value. My own pipeline, which generates directory trees (not just essays), embodies
this principle, as does the Arabic script's morphology.

Chokepoint Field Theory for Vocabulary Choice
In languages with modern standards like Arabic (MSA vs. dialects) or Spanish (RAE standards),
chokepoints manifest as hierarchical ﬁltering through businesses, media, and idiolects. Let X be
the context manifold and Lg →X the concept bundle. The vocabulary ﬁeld σg : X →Lg
minimizes the action
S[σg] =
Z
X

αCcomp(x, σg(x)) + βCprest(x, σg(x)) + γ∥∇Aσg(x)∥2 + λVchoke(x, σg(x))

dµ(x).
Local choice follows softmax on energy E(x, w), with coupling yielding phase boundaries. See
Appendix J for details.

Conclusion
Throughout this essay, we have argued that chokepoint capitalism and its linguistic analogues can
be understood as ﬁeld-theoretic phenomena. By treating vocabulary choice, gesture systems, and
even ecological stigmergy as sections of a manifold constrained by gatekeeping potentials Vchoke,
we recover a uniﬁed picture: deferred diversity, entropy management, institutional curvature, and
exogenous neural networks. The comparative functorial mappings—from deer tail-ﬂagging to
human waves to forest branchings—demonstrate that all communicative systems can be situated
on a higher meta-language manifold. Functors translate between local codes wherever chokepoint
curvature is compatible; where it fails, entropy tears and phase boundaries emerge.
Chokepoint ﬁeld theory reframes capitalism, linguistics, gesture, and ecology under one prin-
ciple: communication is infrastructure subject to entropy and curvature. The apparent diversity
of media—words, bodies, paths—is a set of charts on a single manifold. The task is not to abolish
chokepoints (impossible), but to understand, defer, and redistribute them in ways that preserve
generativity and minimize destructive entropy.
Future work may formalize this framework within RSVP theory's entropic action principles,
embedding language choice and infrastructural design into the same thermodynamic ethics. In this
way, questions of economy, speech, gesture, and ecology can be treated as instances of futarchy
run by physical substrates: each making bets on which communicative pathways will carry mean-
ing into the future.
Epilogue: Living With Chokepoints
At ﬁrst glance, chokepoints look like obstacles. They raise prices, limit access, and enforce de-
faults. But in language, gesture, and ecology, we have seen that chokepoints also shape the very
4

forms of communication we rely on. They are not accidental; they are part of how systems gen-
erate meaning and stability.
A neighbor spotting you behind a gate, a deer ﬂagging its tail, a path pressed into the forest
ﬂoor—all of these are moments where visibility, scarcity, or constraint crystallize into a message.
Each is a reminder that communication is not free-ﬂoating: it depends on substrates that carry it
forward, and those substrates have their own bottlenecks and rules.
The task, then, is not to dream of a world without chokepoints, but to cultivate ways of living
with them. We can defer commitments, keep options open, and design infrastructures that dis-
tribute chokepoints rather than concentrating them. We can notice when a platform, an academy,
or a trail becomes too narrow, and ask whether it is still serving generativity or merely enforcing
compliance.
Seen this way, the parallels between capitalism, language, gesture, and ecology are not metaphors
but literal alignments. All are systems of meaning that pass through gates. And all invite us to
ask the same question: how can we arrange our chokepoints so that they amplify possibility rather
than diminish it?
Closing Thought.
Chokepoints do not only restrict; they also mark. Under certain conditions,
what we call a chokepoint is better understood as a landmark—a feature in the landscape of
meaning that guides passage, anchors memory, and allows orientation across time and space.
Disclaimer on Formalism
The mathematical translations in the appendices parody the cultural fetish for formal rigor while
populating an abstract semantic register. Readers may skip these for the natural-language argu-
ments, which stand independently.
A
Chokepoint Mispricing Theorem
Let RSVP be a symmetric monoidal category of states x = (Φ, v, S) and morphisms respecting
conservation/relaxation. Fix a space X with topology J. The presheaf A : Op(X)op →Set
assigns to U ⊆X the set A(U) of locally feasible RSVP behaviors. A chokepoint policy is a
subpresheaf AF ⊆A with inclusion ι : AF ,→A. The diversity object is Div(A) = colimSec(A).
Let V : Set →R≥0 be a valuation monotone in injections and colimit-superadditive, RSVP-
sensitive.
Lemma 1. If there is a tear (local sections in AF glue in A but not AF), then κ : Div(AF) ,→
Div(A) is a proper mono.
Proof. A tear gives a cone in Sec(AF) that maps to a gluable cone in Sec(A). The induced
comparison is injective but not surjective.
Proposition 1. If κ is proper, then V (Div(AF)) < V (Div(A)).
Proof. Proper mono into a set with non-null complement strictly increases valuation on codomain.
Theorem 1 (Chokepoint Mispricing). Under tears and (V1)-(V3), V (Div(AF)) < V (Div(A)).
Proof. Lemma 1 makes κ proper; Proposition 2 yields strict loss.

Entropic Futarchy in Knowledge Pipelines
Let RSVP be the base category. An institution is modeled as a graph R = (R, E) enriched by
RSVP states xr on vertices. A presheaf H : Op(X)op →Set assigns feasible hires to contexts
U ⊆X. A policy π yields a subpresheaf Hπ ⊆H, restricting feasible hires to those allowed
under π. Deﬁne the valuation functional
J(S) =
X
r∈R
αr E[∆Nr(S)] +
X
e∈E
βe E[N(fe | S)] −λ Risk(S),
where the αr, βe, λ are institutional weights. Entropic Futarchy maximizes

 Div(Hπ)

.
Theorem 2 (Colimit Advantage). If tears exist, then V div
π
< V div.
Proof. By construction, Div(H) is the colimit of all compatible local hiring sections across con-
texts in X. If a tear exists, then there are local sections in Hπ that glue in H but fail to glue in
Hπ, because the policy restriction forbids some amalgams. This produces a proper inclusion
κ : Div(Hπ) ,→Div(H).
Since V is assumed monotone under inclusions and strictly colimit-superadditive on proper
inclusions (as in the Chokepoint Mispricing Theorem, Appendix A), we obtain
V (Div(Hπ)) < V (Div(H)).
Hence, restricting feasible hires through policy π reduces the epistemic diversity valuation
relative to the unrestricted case. This establishes the colimit advantage: greater diversity is always
obtained by deferring restriction until after colimit formation.
Proof. Let A be the baseline presheaf of feasible behaviors and let AF ⊂A be the enforced
(chokepointed) subpresheaf with inclusion ι : AF ,→A. By hypothesis, a tear exists: there is
a cover {Ui →U} and local sections si ∈AF(Ui) that agree on overlaps and glue to some
s ∈A(U), but no section in AF(U) glues the si. By Lemma 1 in Appendix A, this implies that
the induced map on diversity objects
κ : Div(AF) ,→Div(A)
is a proper monomorphism (its image is a strict subset).
The valuation V (or J, as used in adjacent sections) is assumed monotone under inclusions
and colimit-superadditive. Monotonicity gives V (Div(AF)) ≤V (Div(A)); propriety of κ plus
superadditivity yields strict inequality:
V (Div(AF)) < V (Div(A)).
This is exactly the claim. Hence, by the Chokepoint Mispricing Theorem, enforcing AF reduces
the diversity valuation compared to A.
Model.
We model the null wave front as passive advection by a prescribed RSVP vector ﬁeld
v. The governing PDE is the linear transport equation
∂tψ∅(x, t) + v ∂xψ∅(x, t) = 0,
ψ∅(x, 0) = 1[x0,L)(x),
where ψ∅is a binary indicator encoding the domain of constraint activation (initially 1 on the
interval [x0, L) and 0 elsewhere).
6

Discretization.
We discretize the domain [0, L) into N uniform cells of width ∆x = L/N
and advance in time with a step size ∆t chosen to satisfy the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)
stability condition. Let ψn
i denote the cell-averaged value in cell i at timestep n. An upwind
ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme is employed:
ψn+1

v > 0,

 ψn


,
v < 0,
c ≡v ∆t
∆x .
This scheme is ﬁrst-order accurate and monotone, ensuring that no spurious oscillations are intro-
duced at the advancing front.
Parameter choice (example).
For concreteness, take
N = 64,
L = 1.0,
v = 0.8,
CFL = 0.8.
Then ∆x = L/N, ∆t = CFL · ∆x/v, and a ﬁnal time Tfinal = 0.6 gives a well-resolved snapshot
of the wavefront. The spatial grid is
x = linspace(0, L −∆x, N),
with initial condition
ψ(x, 0) =
(
1,
x ≥x0,
0,
x < x0,
x0 = 0.25.
Interpretation.
The numerical simulation produces an advancing sharp front that propagates at
velocity v without distortion or growth in entropy. This behavior is consistent with interpreting
ψ∅as a constraint indicator within RSVP theory: the null wavefront marks the propagation of
unavailable or suppressed states, and its monotonic advance demonstrates the conservation of
structural constraints under passive advection.
C
Deferred Automation as a Monad
Let T be a deferral monad on RSVP with unit η and multiplication µ. Let a : T ⇒Id be forcing
(evaluation). For a diagram D : I →C, deﬁne
XT := a ◦T(colim D),
XE := colim (a ◦T ◦D).
Theorem 3 (Lazy Dominance). If T preserves colimits and tears exist, then J(XT) > J(XE).
Proof. Since T preserves colimits there is a canonical isomorphism
φ : colim (T ◦D)
∼
=
−−→T(colim D).
Postcomposing with a yields a canonical comparison map
κ : XE = colim(a ◦T ◦D) −→a
 colim(T ◦D)

a◦φ
−−→a
 T(colimD)

= XT,
natural in D by functoriality of colimits and naturality of a.
7

Tears mean: there exists a subdiagram of D whose images in T ◦D admit a jointly compatible
cocone that does not remain jointly compatible after pointwise forcing by a. Equivalently, some
cocone λ : T ◦D ⇒Q mediates a map q : colim(T ◦D) →Q with no preimage under κ from
any cocone of a ◦T ◦D. Thus κ is a proper monomorphism XE ,→XT: eager forcing prunes
amalgams that lazy forcing admits.
By assumption, the valuation J is (i) monotone under inclusions and (ii) strictly colimit-
superadditive on proper inclusions induced by lost amalgams. Hence
J(XE) = J
 im(κ)

< J(XT).
Therefore J(XT) > J(XE).
Corollary 1 (Default-app chokepoint). Let F be files, E evaluators. Lazy XT = a◦T(colim P
e run(e, f)),
eager XE = colimrun(e⋆, f). If no evaluator dominates, J(XT) > J(XE).
Proof. Suppose F is the set of ﬁles and E the set of evaluators. The lazy pipeline constructs
XT = a ◦T
 
colim
X
e∈E
run(e, f)
!
,
which preserves all inequivalent amalgams of evaluations prior to forcing. The eager pipeline
instead commits to a single evaluator e⋆, giving
XE = colim run(e⋆, f).
If no evaluator e⋆dominates—i.e. there is no e⋆such that run(e⋆, f) ≃run(e, f) for all
e—then distinct evaluators produce genuinely inequivalent outputs on some f. These inequivalent
amalgams survive in the lazy construction, because colimit formation ranges over all e ∈E before
forcing. In the eager construction, all but one branch are pruned ex ante. This produces a proper
inclusion
XE ,→XT,
mirroring the "tear" condition of the Chokepoint Mispricing Theorem.
Since the valuation J is assumed monotone under inclusions and strictly colimit-superadditive,
it follows that
J(XE) < J(XT).
Thus, under non-dominance, the eager pipeline loses inequivalent amalgams and undervalues epis-
temic diversity relative to the lazy pipeline.
Corollary 2 (Alphabetic Chokepoint). For Phoenician adaptations, if no script dominates, de-
ferred (Phoenician open) yields
J(Div(A)) > J(Div(AF)).
Proof. Let A be the presheaf of all Phoenician-derived script adaptations, and AF ⊂A the
subpresheaf corresponding to a single enforced script (e.g. Greek or Latin, which ﬁx vowels ea-
gerly). If no script dominates, then AF excludes valid local sections that glue in A but not in AF,
producing a tear as in Lemma A. Thus the induced map κ : Div(AF) ,→Div(A) is a proper
monomorphism. Since J is colimit-superadditive, valuation strictly decreases under restriction:
J(Div(AF)) < J(Div(A)).
Hence, retaining Phoenician's open consonantal regime (deferred vowel forcing) preserves in-
equivalent amalgams across cultures, maximizing diversity relative to alphabetic chokepoints.

D
Arabic Morphology as a Deferred-Evaluation Monad
Let Root be the category of consonantal roots, and Word the category of fully assembled forms.
Deﬁne a deferral monad T on Root with unit η : Id ⇒T and multiplication µ : T 2 ⇒T. Vowels
V = {, , } are evaluation morphisms θv : T ⇒Id, while measures Mk : Root →Templ are
functors representing Forms I-X. We deﬁne the lexicon of a root R under deferred evaluation as
(R) = colimk {Mk(θv(R)) | v ∈V }.
Corollary 3. Premature forcing yields
J
 Lexforced(R)

< J
 (R)

.
Proof. Let forced(R) denote the set of forms obtained by applying a chosen vowel θv to R before
functorial expansion by Mk. In contrast, (R) ﬁrst aggregates over all measures Mk and then applies
the vowel morphisms. Because the order of evaluation aﬀects admissible amalgams, there exists
at least one tuple (Mk, v) such that Mk(θv(R)) is valid in the deferred pipeline but excluded from
any eagerly forced pipeline. This produces a proper monomorphism
ι : forced(R) ,→(R).
Since J is monotone under inclusions and strictly superadditive under colimits (by assumption in
§A), we have J(forced(R)) < J((R)). Thus, deferred evaluation preserves inequivalent amalgams
and maximizes lexical diversity.
E
Hebrew Abjad as a Lazy-Evaluation Regime
Objects and functors.
Let Root be the discrete category of (triconsonantal) Hebrew roots R =
c1c2c3. Let Templ be the category of templatic assemblies (binyan skeletons with slot policies), and
Form the category of fully speciﬁed word-forms (orthographic strings with niqqud and dagesh).
We model:
Bb : Root →Templ
for
b ∈B = {Qal, Nifal, Piel, Pual, Hiﬁl, Hofal, Hitpael}
as the binyanim (measures), and
Vν : Templ →Form
for
ν ∈N
as vocalization (niqqud/dagesh) functors. For a set of admissible vocalizations N(T) on T ∈
Templ, we regard {Vν | ν ∈N(T)} as parallel functors reﬁning T to concrete forms.
Deferral monad.
Let T : Templ →Templ be a deferral (lazy) monad with unit η : Id ⇒T
and multiplication µ : T 2 ⇒T that keeps vocalization undecided; evaluation is E : Templ →
Form with Vν = E ◦eVν for a lazy lift eVν : Templ →Templ.
Pipelines (orders of composition).
For a root R deﬁne two natural "pipelines":
(eager)
forced(R) := colimb∈B

a
ν∈N(BbR)
Vν(BbR)

,
9

(deferred)
(R) :=
a
ν∈N ⋆
Vν

colimb∈BBbR

,
where N ⋆is the set of vocalizations admissible after binyan aggregation (i.e., all niqqud patterns
compatible with at least one BbR and any equivalences induced by the colimit). Intuitively, the
eager pipeline ﬁxes niqqud inside each binyan before gluing, while the deferred pipeline glues
binyan skeletons ﬁrst, then vocalizes.
Valuation.
Let J : Form →R≥0 be a diversity/utility valuation that is (i) monotone under
inclusions and (ii) colimit-superadditive.1
Corollary 4 (Lazy advantage for the Hebrew abjad). If at least two distinct vocalizations are ad-
missible for some binyan (or across binyanim) of R, then
J
 (R)

> J
 forced(R)

.
Proof. Write Db(R) := `
ν∈N(BbR) Vν(BbR). By construction there is a canonical comparison
map
ι : colimb Db(R) −→
a
ν∈N ⋆
Vν

colimbBbR

,
induced by the universal property of the colimit on {BbR}b and functoriality of each Vν. When-
ever at least two distinct vocalizations are admissible (within a binyan or across binyanim) that
become jointly compatible after templatic gluing, the right-hand side strictly contains amalgams
not present on the left (eagerly choosing ν before gluing loses cross-binyan amalgams). Hence ι is
a proper mono of attainable forms. By monotonicity and colimit-superadditivity of J, we obtain
J(forced(R)) < J((R)).
Worked example (root , 'K-T-V').
Consider R = . In Qal, common vocalizations include
(kātav, perfective), (kotēv, participle). In Piel/Pual we obtain (kittēv, causative/intensive) and
(kuttav, passive). Eagerly ﬁxing, say, the participial niqqud inside each binyan excludes cross-
binyan alignments that only become sensible after templatic gluing (e.g., nominalizations and
deverbal patterns that share a skeleton but diﬀer in dagesh/niqqud placement). Deferral preserves
these additional amalgams, so J strictly increases by Cor. 4.
Natural-language gloss.
Hebrew writing often omits niqqud; readers supply vowels from con-
text and morphology. Our result formalizes the intuition that not committing to vowels too early
keeps more morphological pathways alive—so when context ﬁnally does force a reading, there are
more well-typed options to choose from.
Proof. Let Root be the set of consonantal skeletons and let T be the deferral monad corresponding
to vocalization operators. For each ρ ∈Root, the immediate (eager) evaluation applies a speciﬁc
vowelization θv to ρ, producing a single lexical outcome. In categorical terms, this corresponds to
composing θv before forming colimits of the possible derivations.
By contrast, deferred vocalization leaves ρ as a symbolic thunk until the colimit of all avail-
able functorial extensions (binyanim, morphological measures) has been formed. Only then is a
vocalization operator applied. Since colimits are colimit-superadditive with respect to valuation
1These are the same mild assumptions used elsewhere in the paper: J rewards strictly larger attainable sets of
forms/analyses.
10

V (by assumption), applying θv after colimit formation yields a strictly larger or equal diversity
object.
Formally, let
Lexforced(ρ) = colim{θv(ρ) | v ∈V },
Lex(ρ) = θv

colim{ρ}

.
Because forcing reduces the set of amalgams prior to colimit, Lexforced(ρ) ⊊Lex(ρ) whenever
multiple θv are admissible. Thus V (Lexforced(ρ)) < V (Lex(ρ)). Hence deferred vocalization
maximizes the colimit in the valuation order.

Theorem (Arabic as Sheafed RSVP). Arabic derivation is a presheaf of functorial pipelines whose
sheaf gluing realizes lexical diversity. Enforcement reduces RSVP valuation unless dominant.

Chokepoint Field Theory for Arabic Vocabulary Choice
Let X be context manifold, Lg →X concept bundle. Field σg : X →Lg minimizes
S[σg] =
Z
X

αCcomp(x, σg(x)) + βCprest(x, σg(x)) + γ∥∇Aσg(x)∥2 + λVchoke(x, σg(x))

dµ(x).
Local choice softmax on E(x, w). Coupling yields fronts.
J.1
Methods for Estimation
Data: Contexts X, concepts G, variants per g. Decompose E(x, w) with proxies. Fit α, β, γ, λ, T
via MLE/MAP. Ablations quantify diversity loss.
J.2
Hierarchical Filtering
Vchoke = θbizφbiz + θmediaφmedia + θeduφedu. Fit θ by domain.
J.3
Meta-Language Manifold
Systems as charts on a manifold. Functors translate; curvature obstructs.
Theorem (Universality). Pairwise functors exist where chokepoints compatible, yielding a sheaf
of manifolds.
J.4
Worked Example: Functorial Mapping
F(tail-ﬂag) = wave, G(wave) = branch-split. Composition shows cross-modality coherence.

Theorem: Universality of Chokepoints
Nonzero Vchoke + γ > 0 yields lock-in and fronts. Defer reduces action unless dominance.
