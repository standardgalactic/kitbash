From RSVP Field Dynamics to TAG Multi-Agent
Hierarchies

September 22, 2025
Abstract
Hierarchical organization is fundamental to intelligent behavior in
both biological and artificial systems, yet current approaches to multi-
agent reinforcement learning (MARL) struggle with scalability and sta-
bility. Recent work on TAG introduces a decentralized framework for
constructing arbitrarily deep agent hierarchies via the LevelEnv ab-
straction, but lacks a unifying theoretical foundation. In this paper we
embed TAG within the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP),
a field-theoretic framework where scalar density (Φ), vector flow (v),
and entropy flux (S) jointly govern system dynamics. We show that
LevelEnv corresponds to a boundary compression of RSVP fields, es-
tablishing TAG as a concrete instantiation of RSVP dynamics. This
embedding yields new predictive laws: (i) conservation principles un-
der symmetry, (ii) entropy production as a bound on stability, (iii) a
depth-compression scaling law for hierarchy eﬀiciency, and (iv) inter-
face tightness as a transfer criterion. Each law translates into empirical
protocols for MARL benchmarks, enabling falsifiable tests that go be-
yond notational generalization. By linking MARL to thermodynamic
and categorical perspectives, our work advances both the design of scal-
able multi-agent systems and the development of RSVP as a predictive
unifying theory.

Introduction
Modern research confronts a dual scaling problem. On one hand, inter-
disciplinary scaling arises because progress on complex questions—such
as intelligence, coordination, and emergence—requires integrating insights
from physics, computer science, neuroscience, mathematics, and philoso-
phy. Each field develops its own models, languages, and benchmarks, and
the combinatorial explosion of cross-disciplinary dependencies makes syn-
thesis increasingly intractable. On the other hand, intra-subject scaling
manifests within each discipline itself: specialized subfields proliferate, pro-
ducing exponentially growing parameter spaces, technical vocabularies, and
internal models that resist unification. As a result, researchers often master
1

narrow fragments of their domain while losing sight of the broader structural
connections.
In reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems, these scaling issues
appear in microcosm. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is moti-
vated precisely by the diﬀiculty of learning in high-dimensional state and
action spaces, yet most existing frameworks are limited to two-level struc-
tures or centralized training regimes.
Multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) further compounds the challenge: as the number of agents grows,
joint state-action spaces expand exponentially, and coordination failures be-
come increasingly likely. Attempts to remedy this by communication proto-
cols, parameter sharing, or specialized abstractions alleviate symptoms but
do not address the fundamental scaling barrier.
This paper argues that a field-theoretic perspective, provided by the
Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP), offers a principled way to tame
both interdisciplinary and intra-subject scaling.
By embedding TAG—a
framework for decentralized hierarchical MARL—into RSVP, we show that
multi-agent hierarchies can be treated as structured entropy-flow systems.
This mapping transforms scaling problems into conservation laws, stability
criteria, and transfer diagnostics that are mathematically well-defined and
empirically testable.
The TAG framework was developed specifically to address the intractabil-
ity in MARL and HRL by enabling arbitrary-depth hierarchies with decen-
tralized coordination. Motivated by the limitations of shallow structures
in handling non-stationarity and scalability, TAG introduces the LevelEnv
abstraction, where higher-level agents shape the environments of lower-level
ones through observation modifications and message passing. This bottom-
up and top-down flow allows for heterogeneous agents and deeper hierar-
chies, outperforming traditional methods in benchmarks. However, without
a unifying theoretical foundation, TAG risks being seen as an ad hoc en-
gineering solution rather than a manifestation of deeper principles.
The
RSVP embedding provides this foundation, linking TAG's mechanisms to
field dynamics and enabling novel predictions.

3.5
RSVP Field Dynamics
[RSVP System] An RSVP system on levels L = {0, . . . , D} is a family
El(t) = (Φl(t), vl(t), Sl(t))
l ∈L,
where Φl is the scalar density, vl the vector flow, and Sl the entropy flux
associated with level l.
3

[Locality] Each level updates only from its immediate neighbors:
El(t + 1) = F l(
El−1(t), El(t), El+1(t)
)
.
For suitable coordinates, this decomposes as
Φl(t + 1) = f
(
Sl−1(t), vl+1(t), Φl(t)
)
,
(1)
vl(t + 1) = g
(
Φl(t), vl+1(t)
)
,
(2)
Sl(t + 1) = h
(
Φl−1(t), vl(t)
)
.
(3)
3.6
Boundary Compression and RL Interface
To align RSVP with reinforcement learning, define compression maps
ol = TΦ(Φl),
al = Tv(vl),
(ml, rl) = TS(Sl),
corresponding to observations, actions, and messages/rewards.
3.7
LevelEnv as Boundary Object
[Level Environment] The boundary object at level l is
Envl = (ol, al, rl) =
(
TΦ(Φl), Tv(vl), TS(Sl)
)
.
Each level l + 1 interacts with Envl as its environment, while level l itself
interacts with Envl−1.
3.8
Derivation of TAG Recursions
Applying the compression maps to RSVP dynamics yields:
(ml, rl) = TS
(
h(Φl−1, vl)
)
= φl(ol−1, rl−1),
(4)
ol = TΦ
(
f(Sl−1, vl+1, Φl)
)
= Al(ml, rl),
(5)
al = Tv
(
g(Φl, vl+1)
)
= πl(al+1, ol−1).
(6)
[TAG as Boundary-Compressed RSVP] Given an RSVP system {El}
with compression maps (TΦ, Tv, TS), the induced boundary processes {Envl}
evolve by
(ml, rl) = φl(ol−1, rl−1),
ol = Al(ml, rl),
al = πl(al+1, ol−1),
which are precisely the TAG update equations. Conversely, any TAG hierar-
chy with suﬀicient statistics (o, a, r) lifts to an RSVP system under suitable
inverse charts.
[Sketch] Apply TΦ, Tv, TS to the RSVP update laws. Since cross-level
interactions occur only through (Φ, v, S) boundaries, the compressed dy-
namics close over (o, a, r). This reproduces the TAG cycle of bottom-up
messages, observation aggregation, and top-down action shaping.
4

3.9
Interpretation and Implications
The derivation shows that TAG is not an ad hoc construction but a quo-
tient of RSVP dynamics under boundary compression. This yields three
important consequences:
1.
Stability through entropy flux.
The RSVP update laws guaran-
tee that bottom-up flux Sl influences upper-level scalar states Φl+1. After
compression, this manifests in TAG as the reward/message channel (ml, rl).
Fluctuations in Sl therefore bound the stability of higher-level learning.
Empirically, this implies that monitoring information-theoretic measures of
message entropy provides an early-warning signal for policy instability.
2. Depth-compression tradeoff.
In RSVP, scalar density Φl accumu-
lates structure by compressing flux from below while being shaped by vector
influences from above. After boundary compression, this corresponds to the
quality of observation summaries ol. The benefit of deeper hierarchies in
TAG depends on the net compression ratio χ achieved at each interface.
There exists an optimal depth D∗maximizing eﬀiciency χD/(λD), where λ
represents per-level coordination cost. This predicts that sample eﬀiciency
improves with depth only up to D∗.
3.
Coordination feasibility via gluing.
Because each LevelEnv is a
boundary object, global coordination reduces to compatibility of local sec-
tions across overlaps.
In sheaf-theoretic terms, the existence of a global
policy corresponds to trivial Čech cohomology of the policy sheaf.
Non-
trivial classes represent obstructions: no globally consistent policy exists
without architectural change. Practically, this means persistent coordina-
tion failures are structural and can be resolved only by adding a mediator
level or widening communication bandwidth.
These consequences move the TAG-RSVP connection beyond notational
unification. They yield testable predictions: entropy flux as a stability indi-
cator, compression laws governing depth, and sheaf obstructions diagnosing
coordination. Each will be explored in Section 5 on predictive laws.

Predictive Laws from RSVP-to-TAG Mapping
The boundary-compressed derivation establishes TAG as a special case of
RSVP. This provides additional explanatory power in the form of predictive
laws that can be empirically tested. We highlight four such laws.
5.1
Conservation under Symmetry
[Entropy-Reward Conservation] If a TAG hierarchy admits a symmetry un-
der permutation of agents at level l that preserves the LevelEnv interface,
then the RSVP entropy flux Sl is conserved in expectation. Consequently,
the aggregate return across symmetric agents is invariant up to statistical
fluctuations.
Prediction: In symmetric cooperative tasks, the variance of per-episode
rewards across agent permutations decays proportionally to 1/L with hier-
archy depth L, provided communication functions are learned rather than
fixed.
5.2
Entropy Production as a Stability Bound
[Flux-Drift Bound] Let ˙Sl denote entropy production at level l as measured
by inter-level message divergence. Then the expected Bellman error drift at
level l+1 is bounded by
∥∆V l+1∥≤C · E[ ˙Sl],
for some constant C depending on the Lipschitz properties of the compres-
sion maps.
6

Prediction: Episodes with large spikes in entropy production at level l
precede instability in value estimation at level l+1. Reducing ˙Sl via learned
communication improves stability.
5.3
Depth-Compression Scaling Law
[Optimal Hierarchy Depth] Let χ denote the average compression ratio at
each interface, and λ the effective penalty per level (computation and coor-
dination cost). Then the sample eﬀiciency of a hierarchy of depth D scales
as
η(D) ∝χD
λD.
There exists an optimal depth D∗that maximizes eﬀiciency.
Prediction: Empirically, adding levels improves sample eﬀiciency only up
to D∗, after which additional depth degrades performance. Increasing in-
terface compression (e.g., via learned communication) shifts D∗upward.
5.4
Interface Tightness and Transferability
[Interface Tightness] The tightness of interface l with respect to task goal g
is defined as
τ l = I(ol; g)
H(ol) ,
the ratio of mutual information between observation summaries ol and goal
variables g to their entropy.
[Transfer Criterion] Upper-level policies trained on interface l transfer
across tasks with related goals if and only if τ l exceeds a threshold τ ∗.
Prediction: When τ l > τ ∗, pre-trained upper-level policies can be re-
used with new lower-level implementations. When τ l < τ ∗, transfer fails
regardless of optimization method.
Together, these four laws demonstrate that the RSVP perspective con-
tributes more than notational generality: it yields conservation principles,
stability bounds, scaling laws, and transfer criteria that are testable within
multi-agent benchmarks. They also provide design rules for hierarchy depth,
communication protocols, and interface evaluation in TAG systems.
6
Empirical Program
To demonstrate that the RSVP-to-TAG mapping yields more than nota-
tional generalization, we propose four empirical protocols that correspond
directly to the predictive laws of Section 5. Each experiment is designed to
be feasible in standard multi-agent benchmarks such as PettingZoo [Terry
et al., 2021], MPE-Spread, or cooperative navigation tasks.
7

6.1
Symmetry and Conservation
Setup.
Construct a symmetric task (e.g., cooperative navigation with N
identical agents). Instantiate TAG hierarchies of varying depth L with either
identity communication functions or learned communication modules.
Measurement.
Compute variance of per-episode cumulative reward across
agent permutations.
Prediction.
Variance decays as 1/L when learned communication is en-
abled, confirming the conservation principle.
Flat baselines and identity
comms do not show this decay.
6.2
Entropy Production and Stability
Setup.
Instrument entropy production ˙Sl at each level by measuring KL
divergence between successive message distributions:
˙Sl
t = E
[
DKL(ml
t ∥ml
t−1)
]
.
Measurement.
Track ˙Sl alongside Bellman error drift in upper levels.
Prediction.
Episodes with spikes in ˙Sl precede instability in value es-
timation at level l+1. Learned communication that reduces ˙Sl improves
stability.
6.3
Depth-Compression Scaling
Setup.
Train TAG hierarchies with depth D ∈{1, . . . , 5}, with both iden-
tity and learned compression functions TΦ, TS.
Measurement.
Estimate interface compression ratio χ as the ratio of
entropy in observations before and after aggregation. Measure sample eﬀi-
ciency as the number of steps to achieve a fixed return threshold.
Prediction.
Sample eﬀiciency increases with D up to an optimal D∗con-
sistent with
η(D) ∝χD
λD.
Learned compression increases χ and shifts D∗upward.
6.4
Interface Tightness and Transferability
Setup.
Pre-train upper levels of a TAG hierarchy on a source task. Swap
in new lower-level agents for a target task with related but not identical
goals.
8

Measurement.
Compute interface tightness
τ l = I(ol; g)
H(ol)
where g encodes task goals. Evaluate transfer success as performance after
limited fine-tuning.
Prediction.
When τ l > τ ∗, pre-trained upper-level policies transfer; when
τ l < τ ∗, transfer fails regardless of optimization. This criterion provides an
actionable design rule for re-use of high-level policies.
Together, these four experimental protocols provide a direct test of
whether the RSVP embedding generates new predictions, stability diagnos-
tics, and design rules beyond those offered by TAG alone. Their success
would establish the RSVP framework as more than a notational generaliza-
tion: as a predictive theory of hierarchical multi-agent learning.

Related Work
Our approach situates TAG [Paolo et al., 2025] within a broader theoret-
ical landscape that spans multi-agent reinforcement learning, hierarchical
reinforcement learning, physics-based entropy theories, and sheaf-theoretic
formalisms. We highlight relevant prior work across these domains and clar-
ify how RSVP provides a unifying framework.
8.1
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
The study of multi-agent systems has accelerated in recent years, motivated
by the need to coordinate multiple adaptive units in complex environments
[Nguyen et al., 2020, Oroojlooyjadid et al., 2023]. Leibo et al. [Leibo et al.,
2019] emphasized the role of autocurricula—emergent challenges driven by
agent interaction—in driving innovation.
To support this growing field,
standardized benchmarks such as PyMARL [Samvelyan et al., 2019], Pet-
tingZoo [Terry et al., 2021], and BenchMARL [Bettini et al., 2024] have been
developed.
Existing MARL methods fall broadly into independent learners [Thorpe
et al., 1997, de Oliveira et al., 2020], parameter-sharing methods [Yu et al.,
2021], and communication-based agents [Foerster et al., 2016, Jorge et al.,
2016]. The dominant paradigm of centralized training with decentralized ex-
ecution addresses non-stationarity [Oroojlooyjadid et al., 2023], but remains
brittle in lifelong learning settings. TAG extends this literature by showing
that fully decentralized hierarchies with LevelEnv abstraction can outper-
form flat and two-level baselines, suggesting that hierarchical structuring
itself confers scalability.
8.2
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
Hierarchical methods have long been viewed as critical for abstraction and
credit assignment.
The Options framework [Sutton et al., 1999] formal-
ized temporal abstraction through semi-MDPs, while Feudal RL [Dayan and
Hinton, 1992] introduced manager-worker decomposition. Later work ad-
vanced these approaches with end-to-end training [Bacon et al., 2016], feudal
networks [Vezhnevets et al., 2017], and multi-agent hierarchical extensions
[Nachum et al., 2019, Yang and Nachum, 2021].
TAG builds most directly on these traditions but replaces explicit goal-
passing with environmental shaping. Rather than specifying intrinsic re-
wards or goals, higher-level agents in TAG modify the observation spaces
of their subordinates.
This mechanism resonates with biological theories
of modular control [Levin, 2022], where environmental constraints induce
emergent coordination.
10

8.3
Entropy and Physics-Inspired Perspectives
Beyond AI, our framework is inspired by thermodynamic and entropic ac-
counts of coordination. Jacobson [Jacobson, 1995] famously derived Ein-
stein's field equations from local thermodynamic arguments, while Verlinde
[Verlinde, 2011] proposed that gravity itself emerges from entropic gradi-
ents. More recently, Carney [Carney, 2022] reviewed insights from quantum
information that frame gravity as an entropic phenomenon.
The RSVP framework adopts a similar stance: it treats information flow,
constraint relaxation, and entropy flux as the fundamental invariants across
domains. Embedding TAG into RSVP thus situates multi-agent coordina-
tion in the same lineage as thermodynamic accounts of emergent laws. Con-
servation, stability bounds, and scaling relations in TAG can be interpreted
as specific cases of RSVP's entropic field dynamics.
8.4
Information Geometry and Variational Principles
RSVP also connects to broader mathematical traditions. Information ge-
ometry [Amari, 2016] provides a natural setting for interpreting policies as
points on curved statistical manifolds. Variational principles in control and
RL [Gallego et al., 2020] echo RSVP's formulation of learning as entropy
minimization under vector flow constraints.
The free-energy principle in
neuroscience [Friston, 2010] offers another parallel, framing cognition itself
as entropy reduction under predictive models.
These traditions highlight that abstraction, learning, and control can
all be cast as thermodynamic processes—aligning precisely with RSVP's
scalar-vector- entropy decomposition.
8.5
Sheaves and Category-Theoretic Approaches
Finally, RSVP's categorical interpretation draws on sheaf theory [Mac Lane
and Moerdijk, 1992, Bredon, 1997]. In this view, local policies are sections
of a sheaf over a base space defined by system configurations, with gluing
conditions enforcing global consistency. Recent work has applied sheaves
to machine learning [Curry et al., 2021], signal processing [Robinson and
Hansen, 2021], and distributed computation, demonstrating the fruitfulness
of this perspective.
This provides RSVP with diagnostic tools: coordination failures in TAG
can be viewed as non-trivial cohomology classes obstructing the existence of
global sections. Such an interpretation is not merely metaphorical—it sug-
gests concrete diagnostics for when hierarchical structures fail to integrate.
11

8.6
Cross-Domain Hybrid Systems
Recent work explores hybrids between MARL and language models, using
LLMs as zero-shot coordinators [Wang et al., 2023]. These efforts demon-
strate the utility of leveraging heterogeneous agents across abstraction levels.
TAG's support for heterogeneous policies across layers, interpreted through
RSVP, offers a principled way to study such mixed architectures.
8.7
Summary
Taken together, these literatures show three gaps that our work addresses:
(1) MARL lacks a unifying theoretical framework; (2) HRL approaches of-
ten stop at two levels and rely on hand-designed goals; (3) categorical and
entropic perspectives have yet to be integrated with scalable multi-agent
benchmarks.
The RSVP embedding of TAG contributes to filling these
gaps by offering a field-theoretic account that unifies conservation, scaling,
and coordination within a single mathematical framework.
Existing research on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has
produced a range of independent, parameter-sharing, and communication-
based approaches [Samvelyan et al., 2019, Terry et al., 2021, Bettini et al.,
2024], while hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has emphasized tem-
poral abstraction through Options [Sutton et al., 1999] and Feudal meth-
ods [Dayan and Hinton, 1992, Vezhnevets et al., 2017].
These methods
remain limited in scalability and often stop at shallow hierarchies. Recent
frameworks such as TAG [Paolo et al., 2025] demonstrate that decentralized
hierarchies with LevelEnv abstraction can outperform flat baselines, yet
lack a unifying theory for conservation, scaling, and coordination. Physics-
based accounts of entropy [Jacobson, 1995, Verlinde, 2011, Carney, 2022]
and mathematical tools from information geometry [Amari, 2016] and sheaf
theory [Mac Lane and Moerdijk, 1992, Curry et al., 2021] suggest deeper con-
nections between learning, thermodynamics, and category-theoretic gluing.
Our contribution embeds TAG into the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum
(RSVP), demonstrating that multi-agent hierarchies are special cases of a
more general field-theoretic framework.
This embedding yields not only
notational unity but new predictive laws—conservation principles, stability
bounds, and depth- compression tradeoffs—that can be empirically tested
in MARL benchmarks.

Conclusion
This work has shown that TAG, a decentralized framework for hierarchi-
cal multi-agent reinforcement learning [Paolo et al., 2025], can be formally
embedded as a special case of the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP)
framework. The LevelEnv abstraction corresponds directly to RSVP's scalar,
12

vector, and entropy fields, with observations as scalar densities, actions as
vector flows, and rewards as entropy flux. This embedding demonstrates
that TAG's empirical effectiveness is not an isolated engineering success but
a manifestation of deeper field-theoretic dynamics.
From this correspondence we derived predictive laws: conservation prin-
ciples under symmetry, bounds on stability through entropy production,
scaling laws for optimal hierarchy depth, and interface tightness as a trans-
fer criterion. Each law yields empirical protocols that can be tested within
standard MARL benchmarks. These predictions move the TAG-RSVP con-
nection beyond notational generalization and toward falsifiable science.
The broader implication is twofold. For MARL, RSVP provides a prin-
cipled lens through which to analyze stability, scalability, and transfer in
hierarchical systems. For RSVP, TAG offers a concrete instantiation that
grounds its abstract thermodynamic and categorical claims in implementable
benchmarks. This mutual reinforcement illustrates the value of cross-domain
synthesis: mathematical generality can illuminate empirical design rules,
and empirical results can validate field-theoretic abstractions.
Future work will extend this framework along two directions: (1) inte-
grating learned communication functions to reduce entropy production and
test deeper hierarchies, and (2) developing categorical diagnostics for co-
ordination failures as sheaf obstructions, with experimental validation. By
embedding TAG into RSVP, we hope to advance not only the scalability
of multi-agent systems but also the credibility of RSVP as a predictive,
unifying theory.

Appendices
A
Full Proof of Theorem (TAG as Boundary-Compressed
RSVP)
We provide the full derivation showing that TAG dynamics arise from boundary-
compressed RSVP fields.
13

A.1
Setup
Recall that an RSVP system is given by
El(t) = (Φl(t), vl(t), Sl(t)),
l ∈L,
with local update rule
El(t + 1) = F l(El−1(t), El(t), El+1(t)).
A.2
Compression Maps
Define ol = TΦ(Φl), al = Tv(vl), and (ml, rl) = TS(Sl). These are surjective
maps that reduce high-dimensional fields to the observation-action-reward
triple of RL.
A.3
Proof
Applying the compression maps to the RSVP updates:
ol(t + 1) = TΦ
(
f(Sl−1, vl+1, Φl)
)
,
(7)
al(t + 1) = Tv
(
g(Φl, vl+1)
)
,
(8)
(ml, rl)(t + 1) = TS
(
h(Φl−1, vl)
)
.
(9)
Because all cross-level dependencies in RSVP are local and boundary-mediated,
the induced processes over (ol, al, ml, rl) close under these equations. This
is precisely the TAG update cycle. Conversely, any TAG hierarchy can be
lifted by embedding its (o, a, r) variables into latent RSVP fields via inverse
charts.

Sheaf-Theoretic Formalism
B.1
Base Site
Let U = {Ui} be an open cover of the agent-communication hypergraph.
Each Ui corresponds to a neighborhood of agents sharing information.
B.2
Sheaf of Local Policies
Define a sheaf F on U such that:
• F(Ui) is the set of stochastic policies over Ui.
• Restriction maps ρij : F(Ui) →F(Ui ∩Uj) enforce consistency on
overlaps.

Nerve Construction
The nerve N(U) is the simplicial complex with vertices = Ui, edges = non-
empty intersections, etc. Cohomology Hk(N(U), F) encodes obstructions.
B.4
Interpretation
Non-trivial H1 corresponds to persistent coordination failures: no global
section exists.
Adding mediator levels is equivalent to refining the cover
until Čech cohomology vanishes.

Critical Discussion
D.1
Limitations
• Compression maps not unique. Multiple TΦ, Tv, TS may yield the
same TAG interface, raising identifiability issues.
15

• Finite sample artifacts.
Entropy flux estimates are sensitive to
small-batch KL divergences.
• Sheaf formalism. While elegant, computing Čech cohomology for
large hypergraphs may be infeasible in practice.
D.2
Failed Generalizations
• Extending the depth-compression law to adversarial settings failed:
entropy production may increase without clear stability breakdown.
• Attempts to generalize symmetry conservation to heterogeneous agents
showed counterexamples.
