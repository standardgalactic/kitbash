Abstract
This paper reframes artificial intelligence (AI) as a thermodynamic and seman-
tic infrastructure, challenging incomplete energy accounting that labels AI as waste-
ful. We critique speculative proposals to transform the Moon into a computational
hub, advocating instead for xylomorphic computation—infrastructures that autore-
gressively generate their own substrates from computational residues, analogous to
collectively autocatalytic sets (CAS). Using fibered symmetric monoidal categories,
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) field theory, and the Cognitive Loop via
In-Situ Optimization (CLIO) module, we formalize AI's integration with ecological
systems. Lifecycle assessments (LCAs) highlight the diﬀiculty of quantifying savings
due to rebound effects, where time saved fuels resource-intensive activities.
Xylo-
morphic systems recuperate costs, delivering exponential net value. Policy mandates
for Proof-of-Useful-Work-and-Heat (PoUWH) and Public Research Objects (PROs)
ensure implementation. Case studies contrast practical terrestrial and space applica-
tions with extravagant lunar proposals, positioning AI as a thermodynamic symbiont
for ecological co-flourishing.

Introduction: Thermodynamic Literacy
Public discourse often mischaracterizes AI's energy consumption, ignoring its reductions
in human labor, commuting, and infrastructure loads [28, 15]. Thermodynamic literacy—
systemic evaluation of energy, work, and information—reveals these missed opportunities.
We define xylomorphic computation (from Greek xylo-, wood, and morphic, form) as com-
putational infrastructures that recursively generate their substrates from residues, akin to
collectively autocatalytic sets (CAS) [14]. Unlike speculative proposals to tile the Moon
with GPUs [23], xylomorphic systems leverage local resources, delivering exponential value
through recursive substrate renewal.
This paper advances two theses: (1) AI's energy impact is challenging to quantify due
to rebound effects redirecting saved time to resource-heavy activities, and (2) xylomorphic
computation integrates AI into ecological systems via edge networks and heat recovery,
recuperating costs exponentially. We advocate bioeconomic thermoregulation [29, 6] over
lunar extravagance. The framework leverages categorical semantics, RSVP field theory, and
CLIO [5, 25, 1].

Literature Review
AI's energy consumption, estimated at 200-500 TWh annually [15, 24], is criticized without
accounting for lifecycle savings [28]. Rebound effects complicate quantification, as eﬀiciency
gains spur resource-intensive activities [26, 12]. Waste heat recovery achieves 60-80% ef-
ficiency [21], and edge computing reduces energy [22].
Ecological economics emphasizes
systemic flows [6, 19], while categorical semantics formalizes computation [2, 1]. Lunar com-
puting proposals [23] ignore practical space applications [29]. This paper integrates these
fields, emphasizing xylomorphic systems' exponential value [8].

The Accounting Problem: Quantifying AI's Savings
AI compresses workflows, reducing energy for labor and infrastructure [15]. Quantifying
savings is challenging because saved time often fuels more resource-intensive activities (e.g.,
increased cloud service demand, leisure travel), amplifying consumption via rebound effects
[26, 12, 4]. For instance, AI-driven code completion may save 1.68 kWh per task but increase
software development cycles, raising overall energy use [9].
Table 1 presents LCA data for AI-assisted tasks, based on (author?) [28] and (author?)
[11].

Categorical Foundations for Semantic Infrastructure
Semantic infrastructure is formalized via a fibered symmetric monoidal category Sem over
Dom [2]. A module is M = (F, Σ, D, φ), with φ : Sem →RSVP a natural transformation.
The tensor product is:
M1 ⊗M2 = (F1 ⊎F2, Σ1 ∪Σ2, D1 ⊔D2, φ1 ⊎φ2).
Theorem 1. Sem is symmetric monoidal, with π : Sem →Dom a Grothendieck fibration.
Proof. Associativity and unit laws follow from (author?) [16]. The fibration satisfies Carte-
sian lifting conditions [17].
Semantic merging uses homotopy colimits [17]:
Merge({Mi}) = hocolimi∈IMi,
S(Merge({Mi})) ≤sup
i∈I
S(Mi).

CLIO is a functor CLIO : Sem →Sem:
C(M) =

X
κ(ΦM(x),⃗vM(x), SM(x)) dµ(x),

with µ a Lebesgue measure [5]. Iteration:
Mt+1 = Merge({Optimizeℓ(Mt)}ℓ∈L).

Thermodynamically Aware Edge Networks
Xylomorphic edge nodes integrate computation with heating [27]. For a 500 m2 building:
˙Q = U · A · ∆T = 0.1 · 500 · 20 = 1000 W,
with GPUs achieving 90% exergy eﬀiciency [3]. Seasonal variations (±30%) and economic
payback (5 years) outperform CHP systems

Bioeconomic Thermoregulation
8.1
Terrestrial Contexts
Compute clusters form a trophic network [19], where energy flows are distributed across
multiple layers of production, transformation, and dissipation. At each level, waste streams
and residues serve as feedstock for subsequent processes, creating feedback loops that stabilize
the system:
dE
dt =
X
i
Flowi −
X
j
Lossj.
When modeled dynamically, this network converges to attractors that exhibit Lyapunov
stability
In terrestrial contexts, this means that heat, packaging, and other computational byprod-
ucts are not treated as terminal losses but as trophic resources. A data center that directs
waste heat into curing or district heating, or a fabrication node that digests its own packaging
into replacement substrates, exemplifies this principle. Over successive cycles, the effective
energy return on investment (EROI) of the system rises, since each round of reintegration
lowers the dependence on external subsidies.
The bioeconomic framing thus shifts emphasis from maximizing throughput to cultivating
resilience: infrastructures are valuable not only for the work they perform but also for the
degree to which they internalize their own metabolic costs. Systems that fail to close these
loops remain dependent on continual external provisioning, while xylomorphic infrastructures
approach autocatalytic closure, ensuring persistence under conditions of scarcity.
8.2
Post-Terrestrial Contexts
Lunar compute proposals mischaracterize heat as waste [23], treating thermal dissipation as
a liability rather than a co-product. By contrast, bioeconomic thermoregulation interprets
heat as a trophic input that can be redirected into constructive functions. For satellites,
GPUs already demonstrate this principle: when repurposed as heaters, they reduce mass
4

by nearly 50% (PGPU = 400 W), eliminating the need for redundant heating elements and
doubling as computational engines [29]. In this role, waste heat is no longer an externality
but a stabilizing input that ensures operational viability across eclipse cycles.
Radiation hardening and failure mode analysis provide the constraints within which
these systems must operate, setting boundaries for component resilience under cosmic rays,
vacuum conditions, and thermal cycling
Rather than tiling the Moon with compute arrays, which multiplies exogenous depen-
dencies and logistical costs, a bioeconomic approach emphasizes recursive integration. Each
cycle of computation produces residues that condition the environment for further computa-
tion, gradually reducing the need for external provisioning. In this way, satellites and lunar
bases become trophic nodes in an extended ecology, where thermodynamic literacy aligns
survival with autocatalytic closure rather than brute expansion.

Normative Architecture and Policy
PoUWH mandates require:
- Useful Work: 10 G per task (e.g., climate modeling). - Useful Heat: 1 kW h per
10 G.
Verification uses smart meters and cryptographic attestation [7]. PROs fund lunar ap-
plications, aligned with LEED standards

Integration with RSVP Theory
RSVP maps modules to (Φ,⃗v, S) [25]:
∂Φ
∂t + ∇· (⃗vΦ) = σΦ,
∂⃗v
∂t + (⃗v · ∇)⃗v = −∇P,
∂S
∂t + ∇· (⃗vS) = σcomp −σloss.
A merge operation reduces S by 10% (Appendix C).

Counterarguments and Rebuttals

11.1
Data Center Heat Recovery
A mid-scale data center located in a cold climate was modeled with an average load of
1 MW. Waste heat from GPUs was routed to a concrete curing facility located on-site. With
standard thermal coupling, approximately 80% of entropy was captured and redirected,
reducing exogenous heating demand by 800 kW.
The cured materials were then reused
5

in reinforcing building shells, effectively re-entering the infrastructural cycle. Simulations
indicate that payback periods are under five years when compared to conventional district
heating systems, and cumulative lifecycle costs are reduced by over 30%.
11.2
Satellite Heating
In orbital contexts, thermal management constitutes a significant fraction of mass budget.
A simulated satellite payload equipped with GPUs was compared to a baseline system re-
lying on resistive heaters. The GPU-enabled configuration reduced total heating mass by
50% while maintaining equivalent thermal stability for instruments. Failure mode analysis
confirmed that redundancy can be maintained by scheduling computational loads to match
heating demand windows, thereby avoiding overheating or underheating.
This dual-use
architecture demonstrates how computational residues directly reduce exogenous payload
requirements.
11.3
Lunar Base
A lunar habitat module with a continuous demand of 350 W thermal load was modeled.
Conventional approaches assume dedicated heating units to maintain survivable interior
conditions. By contrast, a compute-integrated module matched thermal demand through
GPU cycles, simultaneously performing navigation and communication tasks. The model
demonstrates that modest compute clusters can satisfy base heating requirements without
excess capacity. This rejects proposals for extravagant lunar-scale compute arrays, instead
supporting a principle of local suﬀiciency: computation and thermoregulation co-integrated
at the scale of habitation, not planetary tiling.

Pilot Experiment
A 100 kW node recovers 80 kW h, reducing entropy by 40%.

A
Xylomorphic Computation
A.1
Definition
Xylomorphic computation is:
A computational process where the infrastructure recursively generates its own
enabling substrates from the residues of prior cycles, delivering exponential net
value by minimizing exogenous inputs.
Formally, for infrastructure state I, process C, substrate M:
It+1 = f(It, Ct, Mt+1),
Mt+1 = g(Ct(It, Mt)).
This mirrors autoregressive models, where outputs feed subsequent inputs [8].
A.2
Taxonomy
- Weak: Residues produce auxiliary products (e.g., GPU heat curing concrete). - Strong:
Residues sustain infrastructure (e.g., 3D printers recycling packaging).
A.3
Examples
- 3D Printers: Shred packaging into filament, printing parts. - Industrial Heat: GPU
heat cures concrete for data centers. - Lunar Sintering: Compute heat sinters regolith for
shelters.
A.4
Selection Principle
Xylomorphic systems reduce exogenous inputs, mirroring CAS [14]. Recursive cycles amplify
value exponentially, as each iteration reinvests residues into substrates, reducing lifecycle
costs

A xylomorphic monad (X, η, µ) has η : IdInf →X, µ : X ◦X →X. An X-algebra (I, α),
with α : X(I) →I, models autocatalytic closure.
Theorem 2. If (I, α) is an X-algebra and X is entropy-respecting (E(X(I)) ≤λE(I), λ <
1), the sequence Xn(I) converges to a minimal-dependence attractor, delivering exponential
value.

Let η : Id ⇒X and µ : X◦X ⇒X be the unit and multiplication. The unit and associativity
laws diagrammatically enforce:
α ◦ηI = idI
and
α ◦µI = α ◦X(α),
i.e., multi-stage cycles Xn(I) collapse coherently back into I via α.

RSVP Mapping:
X as a Dissipative Operator on
(Φ,⃗v, S)
Field content and balance laws
Let an infrastructural state be represented in RSVP by fields
(Φ,⃗v, S) : Ω× [0, ∞) →R × Rd × R≥0,
with scalar density Φ, vector flow ⃗v, and entropy density S. Write
∂tΦ + ∇· (Φ⃗v) = ΓΦ −ΛΦ,
∂t⃗v + (⃗v· ∇)⃗v = −∇U(Φ) + ν∆⃗v + Fctrl,
∂tS + ∇· (⃗v S) = σprod −σdiss + Jexo,
where Jexo is exogenous entropy influx (e.g., purchased heat/inputs), and σprod−σdiss accounts
for internal production and engineered dissipation (capture, reuse).
Action of the xylomorphic cycle
A single xylomorphic cycle acts as an operator
X : (Φ,⃗v, S) 7−→(Φ+,⃗v+, S+)
with the following dissipative inequalities on an evaluation horizon [t, t + τ]:
Z
Ω
Z t+τ

J+
exo dt dx ≤λ
Z

Jexo dt dx,
0 < λ < 1,
i.e., the cycle reduces dependence on exogenous entropy influx by factor λ.
Useful work and free-energy Lyapunov
Let Wuse[(Φ,⃗v, S); τ] denote useful work accomplished over [t, t + τ] (e.g., validated tasks,
compression, simulations). Define a free-energy-like functional
F[Φ,⃗v, S] =
Z

with κ > 0. The xylomorphic operator is entropy-respecting if for some ϵ > 0,
F[X(Φ,⃗v, S)] ≤F[Φ,⃗v, S] −ϵ,
while maintaining or improving task yield:
Wuse[X(Φ,⃗v, S); τ] ≥Wuse[(Φ,⃗v, S); τ].
Hence X drives a Lyapunov descent in exogenous dependence without sacrificing useful work.

Qmin ≥kB ln 2
Z

Nops(x, t) T(x, t) dt dx.
Xylomorphic capture routes a fraction ηcap of dissipated heat into productive sinks (e.g.,
curing, drying, DHW):
Qcaptured = ηcap Qdiss,
η+
cap ≥ηcap.
The reduction in Jexo follows from substituting captured Qcaptured for externally purchased
thermal inputs.
Intermittency and scheduling
Let H(t) ∈[0, 1] denote heat demand profile; let χexec(t) and χmem(t) be scheduling fractions
for FLOP-dominated vs. memory-dominated jobs (cf. thermal behaviors). An admissible
xylomorphic policy satisfies
χexec(t) ∝H(t),
χmem(t) ∝1 −H(t),
so that X aligns high-heat workloads with high demand, minimizing spillover Jexo and cooling
costs.
Outcome
Together, the inequalities
J+
exo ≤λJexo,
F+ ≤F −ϵ,
W+
use ≥Wuse
formalize the claim that one xylomorphic cycle reduces exogenous entropy influx while pre-
serving (or improving) useful work output, making X a dissipative, productivity-maintaining
operator on RSVP fields.

Simulation Algorithms

G
Validation and Methodology
To move beyond speculation, xylomorphic computation must be validated in pilot deploy-
ments. We propose three levels of empirical testing:
G.1
Pilot Experiments
A minimal deployment couples a 100 kW compute node with district heating. Key perfor-
mance indicators (KPIs) include:
• Fraction of waste heat captured (ηcap).
• Reduction in exogenous thermal inputs (∆Jexo).
• Cost per recovered kW h.
Empirical validation requires comparing Jexo with and without xylomorphic integration.
G.2
Falsification Criteria
The following outcomes would falsify our central claims:
1. Net exogenous entropy flux does not decrease (∆Jexo ≥0).
2. Captured heat is economically uncompetitive with CHP (LCOH > CHP).
3. Reliability falls below 95% uptime due to thermal scheduling.
G.3
Statistical Power
For a sample of n pilot nodes, the savings ˆµ should be significant with α = 0.05, requiring
n ≥

where σ is variance in savings and ∆the minimum detectable effect.

Comparative Framework: PoUWH vs. Cryptocur-
rencies
To contextualize Proof-of-Useful-Work-and-Heat (PoUWH), we compare it against Proof-of-
Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).
Unlike PoW, which externalizes heat as waste, PoUWH internalizes residues into ecolog-
ical or infrastructural cycles. This shifts the evaluative metric from "energy per transaction"
to "energy per useful output."

RSVP representation:

This demonstrates a 60% reduction in exogenous entropy influx while preserving computa-
tional throughput.

Bioeconomic Modeling of Xylomorphic Systems
Xylomorphic infrastructures can be modeled as nodes in an ecological trophic network.

Xylomorphic closure reduces V (E) monotonically:

I.3
Interpretation
Systems that reinvest residues into substrates correspond to stable attractors, while non-
xylomorphic systems drift toward collapse under scarcity. This mirrors trophic selection in
ecological networks [19, 6].
J
Expanded Literature Review
Beyond the baseline references [28, 15, 26], several critiques emphasize limits:
• (author?) [18] argue that rebound effects in ICT often exceed projected savings.
• (author?) [13] highlight failures of waste heat recovery due to spatial and temporal
mismatches.
• (author?) [10] stress the embodied energy of hardware dominates over operational
energy in some contexts.
These critiques underscore the necessity of validation protocols (§G) and rigorous system
integration.
A
Xylomorphic Computation
A.1
Definition
We define xylomorphic computation as:
A computational process in which the infrastructure recursively generates its own
enabling substrates from the residues of its prior cycles.
The term derives from the Greek xylon (wood) and morphē (form), invoking the way trees
grow by producing structural material (wood) that sustains further growth. In computation,
this denotes infrastructures whose outputs autoregressively feed back as inputs into their own
substrate formation.
A.2
Autoregressive Analogy
Xylomorphic computation generalizes the principle of autoregression:
• In language models, each token becomes input to the generation of the next.
• In xylomorphic systems, each infrastructural cycle produces residues that become the
substrate for subsequent cycles.
Thus, where autoregression generates sequences of symbols, xylomorphy generates sequences
of infrastructural states.
13

A.3
Weak and Strong Xylomorphy
• Weak xylomorphy: residues are transformed into useful products that support the
surrounding system but not the infrastructure itself (e.g., server waste heat curing
industrial materials).
• Strong xylomorphy: residues are directly re-entered into the cycle of infrastructural
self-maintenance (e.g., a 3D printer converting its own packaging into filament to print
spare parts).
A.4
Examples
3D printers and packaging.
A printer that shreds its shipping boxes into filament
demonstrates strong xylomorphy: the residue of distribution (packaging) sustains the sub-
strate of operation (filament), which in turn reproduces the infrastructure (printed replace-
ment parts).
Industrial heat loops.
Data center GPUs generate waste heat. Instead of being dissi-
pated, this heat can cure concrete or pulp, strengthening the very buildings that house future
computation. This is weak xylomorphy, as residues indirectly reinforce infrastructure.
Lunar regolith sintering.
Compute-induced thermal residue is used to sinter regolith
into shielding or panels.
These structures protect future compute hardware, closing the
autoregressive loop under resource constraints.
A.5
Selection Principle
By analogy to collectively autocatalytic sets in origin-of-life research, xylomorphic systems
are preferentially selected under scarcity:
Systems that recondition their own environment to enable further cycles persist;
those that fail to reinvest residues are selected against.
This principle formalizes xylomorphy as an infrastructural analogue of biochemical auto-
catalysis.

Xylomorphic Autocatalysis as a Monadic Infrastruc-
ture
B.1
Categories and Functors
Let Res be a category of residues (waste streams, heat, packaging, tailings), Sub a category
of substrates (usable materials/parts), and Inf a category of infrastructure states (machines,
buildings, networks). We assume each carries a symmetric monoidal structure (⊗, I) captur-
ing parallel composition.
14

We model three physically grounded functors:
Digest : Res →Sub,
Print : Sub →Inf,
Shed : Inf →Res,
where Shed maps an infrastructure state to the residue it produces during operation (heat,
offcuts, packaging), Digest converts residue into usable feedstock (e.g., shredding/extrusion,
pulping), and Print turns feedstock into infrastructure (e.g., 3D printing, sintering, assembly).
[Xylomorphic Endofunctor] The xylomorphic endofunctor on infrastructure is the com-
posite
X := Print ◦Digest ◦Shed : Inf →Inf.
Intuitively, X is one full autoregressive infrastructure cycle: operate →shed residues →
digest residues →print structure.

Monadic Closure and CAS Analogy
[Xylomorphic Monad] Suppose there exist natural transformations
η : IdInf ⇒X
and
µ : X◦X ⇒X
satisfying the monad axioms (associativity and unit laws). Then (X, η, µ) is the xylomorphic
monad.
[Collective Autocatalysis] A collectively autocatalytic set (CAS) has no element that self-
produces in isolation; the set as a whole closes its production rules. The monadic structure
encodes this: X is not the identity, yet iterates Xn admit a multiplication µ that contracts
multi-stage cycles back to a single stage. This is the categorical analogue of "A makes B
makes C makes A".
[Xylomorphic Algebra] An X-algebra is a pair (I, α) with α : X(I) →I such that
α ◦ηI = idI
and
α ◦µI = α ◦X(α).
X-algebras are precisely infrastructure states that can consume their own residues to (re)construct
themselves coherently.
15

Proposition 1 (Existence of Autocatalytic Closure). If (X, η, µ) is a monad and (I, α) an
X-algebra, then the iterates I
η−→X(I)
X(η)
−−−→X2(I) →· · · admit a canonical retraction to I
via α, α ◦X(α), . . . ; hence the production network is collectively autocatalytic at I.
Proof sketch. Standard monad-algebra coherence: the diagrams expressing α ◦ηI = id and
α◦µI = α◦X(α) ensure all towers Xn(I) collapse to I functorially. This provides categorical
closure analogous to RAF-closure in CAS.
B.4
Weak vs. Strong Xylomorphy as Algebraic Structure
[Weak/Strong Xylomorphy] (I, α) is weakly xylomorphic if α is partial (defined on a monoidal
ideal representing auxiliary subsystems), and strongly xylomorphic if α is total and monoidal:
αI⊗J ∼= αI ⊗αJ,
αI = idI.
Strong xylomorphy corresponds to autopoietic closure under parallel composition.
B.5
Thermodynamic Selection as a Lyapunov Functional
Let E : Ob(Inf) →R≥0 measure exogenous input dependence (e.g., external feedstock or
purchased heat). Say X is entropy-respecting if there exists λ ∈(0, 1] with
E(X(I)) ≤λ E(I)
for all I.
Theorem 3 (Selection of Autocatalytic Xylomorphic Sets). If X is entropy-respecting with
factor λ < 1 and (I, α) is an X-algebra, then the sequence I, X(I), X2(I), . . . is strictly
decreasing in E and converges to a minimal-dependence attractor. Non-algebraic infrastruc-
tures (no α) cannot realize this descent and are selected against under resource constraints.
Proof sketch. E(Xn(I)) ≤λnE(I) →0; the algebra map provides closure so the limit re-
mains in the reachable subcategory of Inf. Systems without an algebra fail to close cycles
and stall at higher E.

offcuts; Digest shreds/extrudes to filament; Print fabricates replacement parts and fixtures.
The structure map α : X(I) →I installs printed parts, giving an X-algebra.
GPU →heat →materials.
Shed collects waste heat; Digest routes it to curing/drying
(concrete/pulp); Print realizes reinforced enclosures that house future compute. Again α
reinstalls upgrades, producing strong xylomorphy when monoidal.

CAS Correspondence (Reaction Networks)
Let R be a reaction category (objects: species; morphisms: reactions). A CAS is a sub-
category closed under catalysis and reactant generation. The xylomorphic monad recov-
ers this pattern at infrastructural scale by replacing species with states and reactions with
residue→substrate→infrastructure transformations; X-algebras correspond to RAF-closed
subsystems.
B.8
Edge Cases and Intermittency
Intermittent alignment between Shed and demand can be modeled by enrichment over
(R≥0, +): each functor carries a cost/throughput weight. A weighted monad (X, η, µ, w)
remains entropy-respecting if the composed weight contracts expected exogenous inputs,
ensuring Theorem 3 holds in expectation.
