The Fall of Space: Entropic Relaxation and Structure
Without Expansion in a Scalar-Vector Plenum
Flyxion
August 15, 2025
Abstract
The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) model proposes a cosmological frame-
work where redshift, cosmic structure, and gravitational effects emerge from interactions
of a scalar density field Φ, a vector flow field v, and an entropy field S, without requiring
metric expansion. This approach revisits historical debates on static versus expanding
universes, from Einstein's static model to the Big Bang paradigm, highlighting why a
return to a static frame with dynamic plenum reorganization addresses persistent anoma-
lies in the standard ΛCDM model. Gravitational collapse (lamphron process) releases
binding energy that enhances a vacuum-capacity field Φ (lamphrodyne process), gener-
ating outward pressure mimicking inflation and dark energy. Lamphron refers to the
inward collapse releasing energy, while lamphrodyne denotes the outward expansion
of vacuum capacity. Implemented on a 3D lattice, RSVP reproduces the cosmic web,
explains redshift as an entropic gradient (z ∝∆S), and resolves ΛCDM anomalies like
the Hubble tension and CMB cold spot. We present field equations, a minimal simulation
algorithm, and testable predictions for void lensing, high-z BAO, and CMB anisotropies,
incorporating Cartan torsion for plenomic vorticity. These predictions can be tested with
missions such as Euclid for void lensing, Square Kilometre Array (SKA) for large-scale
structure, and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for high-redshift observations. The
Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise (TARTAN) framework enhances
simulations, enabling unistochastic quantum-like behavior to emerge from recursive
field dynamics, aligning with Barandes's reformulation of quantum theory. Falsifiability
criteria and comparisons with ΛCDM strengthen the model's credibility.

Introduction
The ΛCDM model, the standard cosmological framework, posits an expanding universe
driven by dark energy and cold dark matter. Its successes include precise predictions of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies [1], big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)
abundances, and large-scale structure formation. However, persistent anomalies challenge
its completeness: the Hubble tension, a 5-10% discrepancy between local measurements
(H0 ≈73 km/s/Mpc [2]) and CMB-inferred values (H0 ≈67 km/s/Mpc, 5σ significance); CMB
irregularities, including hemispherical asymmetry, the cold spot's 3.7-degree scale, and
unexpected integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effects; and the missing satellites problem, where
observed dwarf galaxies are fewer than predicted. The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum
(RSVP) model proposes a static universe where space reorganizes through entropic relax-
ation, akin to a foam network settling without size change. Redshift emerges from entropy
gradients (z ∝∆S), structure forms via scalar-vector coupling, and CMB uniformity arises
1

from plenum thermalization, eliminating the need for inflation or dark matter. Unlike Ein-
stein's static model, abandoned due to instability and redshift evidence, RSVP is a non-metric,
thermodynamic framework inspired by Jacobson's thermodynamic gravity [3], Verlinde's
emergent gravity [4], and Padmanabhan's entropic cosmology [5]. It aligns with modern
nonequilibrium thermodynamics and non-Riemannian geometry [6], extending these by
modeling gravity as an entropic process in a dynamic plenum. Recent entropic gravity
theories, such as Vopson's mass-energy-information equivalence [7], provide a foundation
for RSVP's approach. Vopson derives Newtonian gravity from information entropy min-
imization on a Planck-scale lattice, a concept RSVP extends through recursive causality
and dynamic field interactions. Similarly, Barandes's unistochastic quantum theory [8]
reformulates quantum mechanics using directed conditional probabilities, which RSVP's
Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise (TARTAN) framework can generate
as emergent phenomena from field dynamics. Table 1 compares ΛCDM and RSVP predictions,
emphasizing RSVP's parameter economy and unique signatures. The historical context of

cosmology reveals a progression from static models to expanding ones, driven by Hubble's
law and CMB discovery. However, anomalies suggest revisiting static paradigms with ther-
modynamic twists. RSVP integrates insights from Bianconi's entropy-derived gravity [9],
Carroll and Remmen's distinction between holographic and thermodynamic gravity [10],
and Darmos's space particle dualism [11], where gravity arises from baryon counts rather
than mass-energy.

Contributions
1. A field-theoretic model with Φ-v-S coupling, replacing metric expansion.
2. Lattice simulations demonstrating cosmic web emergence and entropic redshift.
3. Predictions for void lensing, BAO deviations, and CMB anomalies.
4. A minimal simulation algorithm for TARTAN-style tessellations.
To address criticisms of entropic gravity (e.g., Visser's multi-temperature baths [12], Feyn-
man's dissipation concerns [13]), RSVP's recursive causality ensures consistent entropy
production without unphysical assumptions.

Field Definitions and Dynamics
The RSVP plenum is defined by three fields, each with a clear physical interpretation:
• Scalar field Φ : R1,3 →R, representing vacuum capacity or plenum density, analogous
to tension in a stretched membrane that stores and releases energy during collapse
and expansion processes.
• Vector field v : R1,3 →TR3, encoding negentropic flow ("falling space"), similar to
a reversed heat flow where active pumping drives motion from low to high entropy
regions.
• Entropy field S : R1,3 →R, driving redshift and constraint relaxation, acting as a
gradient-driven clock that quantifies the "age" or relaxation state of local plenum
regions.
The Lagrangian density motivates the dynamics:
L = 1
2∂µΦ∂µΦ −U(Φ) + ρm
2 |v|2 −ρmφ + λΦσg(ρm) −Γ ˙Φ2,
(1)
where 1
2∂µΦ∂µΦ is the kinetic term for Φ, representing free propagation of vacuum capacity
fluctuations; −U(Φ) is the potential energy, potentially mimicking a cosmological constant at
low Φ; ρm
2 |v|2 is the kinetic energy of matter advected by the flow v; −ρmφ couples matter to
the Newtonian potential, with ∇2φ = 4πGρm; λΦσg transduces gravitational strain (σg = |∇g|,
g = −∇φ) into Φ-field energy, linking collapse to vacuum pumping; −Γ ˙Φ2 provides damping,
ensuring energy dissipation. This form links to entropic gravity (entropy gradients drive
forces), fluid dynamics (plenum as a viscous medium), and non-Riemannian cosmology
(torsion from v shear).
2.1
Coupling Constants
The constants λ, α, β, Γ, κ, η, ζ arise from dimensional analysis or fundamental scales. For
instance, κ (matter-vacuum interchange) has units of energy density inverse, potentially set
by Planck-scale physics. Constraints come from observations: α (strain-Φ coupling) tuned
to match void growth rates; β (entropy-Φ exchange) to fit redshift-distance relations. To
reduce free parameters, λ and α can be related via thermodynamic consistency, measurable
through BAO shifts or CMB multipoles.

with entropy-dependent connection Γλ

yielding dν
ds = −ν∂sS/2 in the eikonal approximation, analogous to refractive index variation
in media. Microphysically, this arises as a statistical-mechanical effect on the electromagnetic
field phase, where photons interact with plenum fluctuations like diffusion in plasma. Ana-
logues include Tolman temperature gradients (redshift in thermal equilibria), gravitational
time dilation (clocks in potentials), and photon scattering in inhomogeneous media.

Field Equations
The action S =

L√−gd4x, varying with respect to fields. For Φ:
□Φ + U′(Φ) −λσg + 2Γ¨Φ = 0,
leading to a diffusion equation with source terms. Similar for others. Dimensional analysis:
[Φ] = M1/2L−1/2T −1, consistent across terms. Special cases: v = 0, Φ constant reduces to
Newtonian. The entropy balance is:
∂tS + ∇· JS = ησg + ζ(∇Φ)2.

Lattice Implementation
The plenum is discretized on an N × N × N cubic lattice with fields ρm, Φ, S, v. Steps include:
1. Solve Poisson equation ∇2φ = 4πGρm.
4

2. Compute strain σg = |∇g|, g = −∇φ.
3. Update Φ with diffusion, pumping, and damping terms.
4. Adjust ρm to enforce budget.
5. Include −∇pΦ in momentum equation.
Pseudocode for the lattice integrator:
# Initialize grid and fields: rho_m, Phi, S, v (vector field), phi (potential)
# Assume N x N x N grid, dt timestep, parameters alpha, beta, gamma, D_Phi,
kappa, G, c_Phi, etc.
for each timestep:
# 1. Solve Poisson for gravitational potential phi
g = -gradient(phi) # gravitational acceleration
phi = poisson_solver(4 * pi * G * rho_m) # using FFT or iterative solver
# 2. Compute gravitational strain sigma_g
sigma_g = magnitude(gradient(g))
# 3. Update Phi
dot_Phi = (alpha * sigma_g + beta * time_derivative(S) - gamma *
time_derivative(Phi) + D_Phi * laplacian(Phi))
Phi_new = Phi + dt * dot_Phi
# 4. Enforce local budget on rho_m
rho_m = rho_m - kappa * (Phi_new - Phi)
Phi = Phi_new
# 5. Update momentum equation for v, including back-reaction from p_Phi =
c_Phi**2 * Phi
grad_p_Phi = c_Phi**2 * gradient(Phi)
# Assume Navier-Stokes like solver for v:
# rhs = -grad_p_m - rho_m * grad_phi - grad_p_Phi
# v = update_velocity(v, rho_m, rhs, dt)
# Optional: Update S with entropy balance
# dot_S = eta * sigma_g + zeta * magnitude(gradient(Phi))**2 -
divergence(J_S)
# S = S + dt * dot_S
# Advection for rho_m, Phi, S if needed
# rho_m = advect(rho_m, v, dt)
# etc.
# Outputs: compute void statistics, lensing, RSVP redshift integrals along
rays
Parameter sensitivity: Increasing β steepens redshift slope; varying α alters web topology
from filament-dominated to void-heavy. Visualization: Example outputs show early uniform
Φ evolving to cosmic web by 103 iterations.

TARTAN Framework
TARTAN stands for Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise. It is a concep-
tual and computational framework for enhancing simulation, visualization, and physical
interpretability within RSVP:
• Trajectory-Aware: Tracks history and intent of field evolution for causal memory.
• Recursive Tiling: Subdivides domain into nested tiles for multiscale resolution.
• Annotated Noise: Semantic perturbations for structured randomness.
Applications: Scene evolution, field interaction encoding, visualization of CMB anomalies.

Recursive Causality and Dynamical Extension of Vopson's En-
tropic Gravity in RSVP
While Vopson's model effectively captures gravity as an emergent entropic force from a
discrete, static lattice of Planck-scale bits, the RSVP theory enriches this picture by incor-
porating recursive causality as a fundamental dynamical principle. Recursive causality
in RSVP refers to the continuous, self-referential feedback loop whereby local changes
in informational entropy density (Φ) and directed negentropic vector fluxes (v) not only
respond to existing entropy gradients but also alter those gradients in a time-dependent
manner, thus dynamically shaping the evolving scalar-vector-entropy field configuration.
This recursive interplay means that the scalar and vector fields mutually influence each
other through iterative cycles of entropic relaxation and negentropic structuring. Instead
of a static, one-shot minimization of information entropy as in Vopson's framework, RSVP
describes a non-equilibrium, temporally recursive process in which localized fluctuations
and constraints propagate and co-evolve. This yields emergent gravitational phenomena that
evolve and self-organize at multiple scales, reflecting the universe's observed hierarchical
structure without requiring spacetime expansion. Mathematically, the recursive causality
manifests in RSVP's coupled field equations, where time derivatives of Φ and v depend on
spatial gradients of entropy and vector fluxes, generating feedback loops that stabilize or
amplify structures depending on local entropic conditions. Hence, RSVP's recursive causal-
ity provides a crucial dynamical generalization of Vopson's entropic-information gravity,
transforming a static entropic force into a continually evolving, self-consistent process. This
approach better captures the irreversible, time-directed nature of entropy evolution and
offers a robust theoretical framework for exploring gravitational phenomena as emergent
from the deep informational structure of spacetime itself.

Unistochastic Quantum Theory as an Emergent Description
of the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum
The unistochastic reformulation of quantum theory, as proposed by Barandes, replaces the
wavefunction paradigm with directed conditional probabilities between configurations,
enabling a causally local hidden-variables interpretation. We hypothesize that this unis-
tochastic structure emerges from RSVP's recursive field dynamics, mediated by TARTAN
coarse-graining. Let the RSVP state on a lattice L be fields (Φ, v, S) with evolution
∂tΦ = FΦ[Φ, v, S] + ηΦ,
(5)
∂tv = Fv[Φ, v, S] + ηv,
(6)
∂tS = FS[Φ, v, S] + ηS,
(7)
with local flux form J ≡Φv and an entropy-production constraint that enforces microre-
versibility up to controlled dissipation. Introduce a gauge 1-form A canonically conjugate
(e.g., via a Clebsch or symplectic potential) so that circulation
θ(γ) =
I
γ
A · dx
assigns a phase to any coarse path γ. Entropy S acts as a Lagrange multiplier that regulates
allowed phase curvature dA (torsion/vorticity) to keep dynamics stable. TARTAN provides
7

recursive tiling {T (ℓ)
i
} at scales ℓ= 0, 1, 2, . . . , trajectory buffers storing path counts and fluxes
between tiles, Gaussian aura fields that smooth fields within tiles, and annotated noise η
with semantic tags that preserve conserved quantities and encode microreversibility. From
a short time step ∆t, collect inter-tile fluxes at scale ℓ:
F (ℓ)
i→j =

∂T (ℓ)

(with path tags).
Define the coarse transfer operator (Markov kernel) on tiles:
P (ℓ)
ij
=
F (ℓ)
i→j
P
k F (ℓ)
i→k
.
So P (ℓ) is row-stochastic and captures how RSVP mass/intent flows between tiles in one
step. Balance P (ℓ) to a bistochastic B(ℓ) using Sinkhorn-Knopp scaling with thermodynamic
weights derived from S:
B(ℓ) = DLP (ℓ)DR,
DL, DR > 0,
with DL, DR chosen to enforce P
j B(ℓ)
ij = 1 = P
i B(ℓ)
ij . This step selects the maximum-entropy,
flux-preserving coarse dynamics compatible with observed inflow/outflow (Jaynesian infer-
ence with S as a constraint). A bistochastic matrix B ∈Rn×n is unistochastic if there exists a
unitary U ∈U(n) with |Uij|2 = Bij. Equivalently, seek phases Θ = {θij} such that
Uij =
p
Bijeiθij,
X
k
UikUjk = δij.
The orthogonality constraints are
∀i < j :
X
k
p
BikBjkei(θik−θjk) = 0.
(*)
TARTAN's trajectory buffers give coarse phase increments from the RSVP gauge field:
θik =
1
ℏeff
I
γ(i→k)
A · dx,
where γ(i →k) is a representative coarse path cluster from tile i to k, and ℏeff is an emergent
action scale set by RSVP's entropy-flux budget. The annotated noise enforces approximate
microreversibility and phase additivity across path concatenations. Under the RSVP con-
straints (bounded vorticity/torsion, balanced entropy production), these phases can be
tuned—by adjusting the local S-controlled gauge—so that the interference sums in (*) cancel.
Intuitively:
• Magnitudes pBikBjk come from coarse flux counts.
• Relative phases θik −θjk are circulations of A around TARTAN's tile-edge loops.
• Entropy S regulates dA to make the polygonal phasor sums close to zero (orthogonality).
Thus, RSVP + TARTAN produce a feasible phase field that lifts B to a unitary U. Define a
Hilbert space H(ℓ) ∼= Cnℓwith basis {|i⟩} for tiles. Let coarse amplitudes be
ψi = √µieiφi,
8

where µi is the coarse RSVP mass/intent in tile i and φi the tile's gauge phase (mean circula-
tion). One TARTAN step acts by
ψ′ = Uψ,
Pr(j) = |ψ′
j|2 =
X
i
|ψi|2|Uji|2 + interference.
Because |U|2 = B, the marginals respect the bistochastic coarse flow, while interference terms
arise from RSVP phase correlations. Measurements correspond to reading tile occupancy;
the Born rule appears as the modulus-square map inherited from unistochastic structure.
In the 2 × 2 case, every bistochastic matrix is unistochastic:
B =

1 −a
1 −a
a

,
U =

√a
√1 −a
√1 −a
−√a

eiϕ
(up to phases). RSVP/TARTAN phases determine the relative sign. This corresponds to a single
gauge-controlled interference degree of freedom. In the 3 × 3 case, not every bistochastic
matrix is unistochastic. Feasibility of phases solving (*) imposes geometric "triangle-closure"
constraints on the phasors {pBikBjk}. In RSVP terms: tile-loop circulations must permit
closure—i.e., net coarse vorticity (integrated dA) across certain TARTAN loops must sit in an
allowed polytope. Tuning S (entropy pressure) adjusts A to land B inside the unistochastic
subset. Define a one-step transfer operator T on coarse density via RSVP flux statistics.
TARTAN's entropy balancing yields a doubly stochastic B on tile space. By Stinespring
dilation or polar decomposition on the ℓ2 space of tiles, and with RSVP-induced phases, you
realize
U : ℓ2 →ℓ2
unitary with
|Uij|2 = Bij.
Thus the coarse dynamics admits a unitary dilation; the physical (observable) probabilities
are the mod-squares—exactly the unistochastic recipe.
1. Solve the tile Poisson equation ∆S(ℓ) = −

ρ(ℓ).
2. Set φ = −(Θ/ν) S(ℓ) and advance with ˙v = −∇φ.
3. For light/rays: refractive index n = exp

; integrate ray equations.
4. Optional GR-like update: evolve g(ℓ) by (11) between re-tilings.
5. Toggle coherence: use your unistochastic U to reduce D(ℓ) and watch the same mass
produce deeper φ.
In RSVP + TARTAN, mass is an entropy source; smoothing drives S to solve a Poisson law, and
dynamics follow g ∝∇S. Geometry emerges as the fixed point of multi-scale smoothing —
"gravity as entropic smoothing," quantitatively. TARTAN turns RSVP fluxes into bistochastic
flows; RSVP phases supply a unistochastic unitary U with |U|2 = B, giving an emergent
Born rule. The entropy field S(ℓ) obeys a Poisson law sourced by mass, making gravity
precisely entropic smoothing with g = Θ
ν ∇S(ℓ) and ∆φ = 4πGeffρ. Coherence lowers the
effective diffusivity, so Geff ↑in ordered regions. In categorical/sheaf terms, coarse-graining
is a functor Cℓ: Sect(F) →Stoch, quantization is Qℓ: Sect(F) →Hilb, and the Born natural
transformation | · |2 : Hilb ⇒Stoch commutes with composition and cover refinement.

Discussion and Outlook
RSVP resolves anomalies by modeling cosmology as entropic recursion in a static plenum,
extending Jacobson, Verlinde, and Padmanabhan's works rather than resurrecting Einstein's
static model. Unique predictions: Torsion-induced spin alignments, entropy-gradient Hubble
variance. Falsifiability: Mismatches in SN Ia z > 2 curves, CMB lensing without peaks, or
BAO scales incompatible with S-oscillations would falsify. ΛCDM outperforms in precise
BBN; RSVP needs tighter constraints for parity. Objections: Early nucleosynthesis fits via
adjusted Φ pumping; CMB polarization unchanged at linear order. Deeper unification: RSVP
may emerge from quantum gravity, e.g., loop quantum cosmology with torsion. Next steps:
GPU simulations (5123), Boltzmann coupling for CMB, and survey tests for falsification.
