Toward Societal Mesh Organs: A Framework for
Civilizational Memory Infrastructure (2025-2035)
1
Abstract
By 2035, emerging constraints on biospheric stability, sociopolitical foresight, and AI
autonomy will necessitate the development of planetary-scale inferential organs. We
call these Societal Mesh Organs (SMOs)—cyber-physical infrastructures that integrate
high-resolution sensing, counterfactual simulation, ethical modulation, and recursive
planetary inference.

Theoretical Contributions
1. Ethical Landauer Threshold: Minimum energy required for a justifiable moral
inference under planetary constraints.
2. Simulation Constitution: Foundational legal-theoretical basis for regulating what
futures may be simulated and enacted.
3. Exocortical Diplomacy: Treaty-based negotiation between embodied humans and
distributed cognitive overlays (e.g., SMOs as planetary organs negotiating with cities,
citizens, and corporations).

Conclusion
Societal Mesh Organs are not tools—they are cognitive institutions. Their success de-
pends not just on technical scaling, but on resolving deep philosophical and constitu-
tional questions about cognition, agency, and moral time. The transition from token-
based AI to civilizational inference architectures represents the true meaning of post-
singularity coordination: not omniscience, but ontological stewardship.
