Irreversible Histories as Ontological Primitives:
A Constraint-First Foundation for Dynamic Ontologies
Flyxion
December 26, 2025
Abstract
This paper argues that irreversible history, rather than entityhood, must be treated as a
top-level ontological primitive in any system intended to model dynamic, evolving domains.
Contemporary ontology engineering frameworks, particularly those grounded in Description
Logic and exempliﬁed by the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), presuppose identity preservation
and monotonic accumulation of facts. These assumptions render them systematically incapable
of representing irreversible commitment, entropy-driven divergence, and historical dependence.
We propose a constraint-ﬁrst alternative in which entities emerge as stabilized invariants within
admissible histories, rather than serving as foundational primitives. The paper analyzes the
formal limits of OWL-based reasoning, demonstrates how ontology drift arises as an entropic
phenomenon rather than an engineering defect, and outlines a history-based foundation capable
of subsuming classical ontologies as low-entropy special cases.

Introduction
Ontology engineering has traditionally prioritized entities over processes, treating objects as pri-
mary and histories as derivative. This orientation has proven eﬀective in static or slowly evolving
domains, but it fails systematically when applied to systems characterized by irreversibility, learn-
ing, agency, or semantic drift. This paper argues that these failures are not accidental, nor are they
merely limitations of tooling. They arise from a deeper metaphysical commitment to state-based
identity that is incompatible with dynamic reality.
2
The Entity-Centric Assumption in Formal Ontologies
We examine the implicit assumptions shared by dominant ontology frameworks, focusing on the
treatment of identity, persistence, and change. Particular attention is paid to the continuantoccur-
rent distinction in BFO and its reliance on identity-preserving mappings across time.
3
Irreversibility and the Failure of State-Based Identity
This section formalizes irreversibility as an ontological constraint rather than an epistemic inconve-
nience. We show that once history is treated as constitutive rather than auxiliary, identity becomes
1

path-dependent and non-reversible, undermining entity-ﬁrst modeling strategies.
4
Limits of Description Logic and OWL
We demonstrate that Description Logic is structurally incapable of representing irreversible exclu-
sion, refusal, and entropy-bounded futures. The argument is not that OWL lacks expressivity in
practice, but that its monotonic semantics prohibit the representation of ontological inadmissibility.
5
A Constraint-First Ontological Foundation
We introduce a history-ﬁrst ontology in which admissible futures, rather than entities, form the
primary semantic domain. Scalar stability, vector constraint propagation, and entropy over futures
are introduced as abstract structural primitives suitable for cross-domain application.
6
Ontology Drift as an Entropic Phenomenon
Using a worked example of ontology versioning, we show that mapping failures over time arise from
entropy accumulation rather than inconsistency or poor design. Identity divergence is shown to be
inevitable once histories branch irreversibly.
7
Relation to Existing Ontologies
We demonstrate how entity-centric ontologies such as BFO can be embedded as low-entropy sub-
theories within a history-ﬁrst framework. Their empirical success is explained without granting
them foundational status.
8
Implications for AI, Learning Systems, and Agency
The framework is extended to artiﬁcial systems whose identities evolve through training and inter-
action. Intelligence is characterized as the maintenance of low-entropy histories under constraint
rather than the possession of static representations.
Ontology engineering must shift from describing what exists to constraining what can continue
to exist. Treating irreversible histories as ontological primitives provides a uniﬁed explanation for
the successes and failures of existing frameworks while opening a principled path toward represent-
ing dynamic, agentive systems.
9
Limits of Description Logic and OWL
Description Logic (DL), and by extension OWL-based ontology engineering, is founded on a set
of semantic commitments that privilege monotonicity, open-world reasoning, and state-based iden-
tity. These commitments have proven extremely eﬀective for classiﬁcation, subsumption reasoning,
2

and interoperability in domains where entities are assumed to persist and where change is either
negligible or externally managed.
However, when applied to dynamic systemssuch as evolving
scientiﬁc theories, learning agents, biological lineages, or socio-technical infrastructuresthese same
commitments become structural liabilities.
The core limitation is not a lack of expressive power in the syntactic sense, but an incompati-
bility between DL semantics and irreversible historical dependence. OWL reasoners operate over
interpretations that assign truth values to assertions in a model-theoretic space where knowledge
can be extended but never invalidated. Once an assertion is entailed, it remains entailed under any
admissible extension of the ontology. This monotonicity precludes the representation of exclusion
as a ﬁrst-class ontological operation. In particular, OWL cannot express that a future state of the
ontology is inadmissible due to prior commitments, only that it is currently unasserted.
This becomes decisive when modeling identity over time. In OWL, identity is preserved unless
explicitly contradicted, yet contradiction itself has no constructive role. The logic has no native
mechanism for expressing that an entity has ceased to exist as a result of historical commitments,
or that a previously valid classiﬁcation has become ontologically impossible.
Retraction, when
supported at all, is an external engineering operation rather than an internal semantic event.
As a result, OWL ontologies systematically conﬂate absence with impossibility. The failure to
assert a relation is indistinguishable from a principled refusal of that relation. This distinction is
not merely philosophical. In systems where agency, policy enforcement, or irreversible decisions
matter, the inability to encode inadmissibility collapses crucial semantic structure. A system may
be forced to treat prohibited actions, obsolete identities, or invalid mappings as merely unknown
rather than structurally ruled out.
Attempts to address these limitations through non-monotonic extensions, rule layers, or external
versioning systems only defer the problem. They treat irreversibility as a meta-level concern rather
than as an ontological primitive.
The consequence is an ever-growing gap between the formal
ontology and the system it is intended to model, particularly as that system evolves over time.
10
A Constraint-First Ontological Foundation
To overcome these limitations, we propose a constraint-ﬁrst ontological foundation in which irre-
versible history, rather than entityhood, serves as the primary semantic primitive. In this frame-
work, the basic object of ontology is not an entity at a time, but a history constrained by admis-
sibility conditions. Ontological meaning is deﬁned not by what exists in a snapshot, but by which
futures remain possible given what has already occurred.
Formally, we begin with a space of admissible histories, each history being a ﬁnite, preﬁx-closed
sequence of events. An event is deﬁned not merely as a change in state, but as an irreversible
commitment that restricts future extensions of the history. The ontology is thus a theory of which
histories are admissible, rather than a catalog of which entities exist.
Entities, in this view, are secondary constructs. They emerge as stabilized invariants across
families of histories that share suﬃcient structural similarity. Identity is therefore not primitive but
derived. An entity persists not because it is assumed to do so, but because the constraints governing
3

admissible histories permit its continued re-identiﬁcation under entropy-bounded variation.
Three abstract structural components suﬃce to describe this foundation across domains. Scalar
stability captures the degree to which a structure resists dissolution across histories. Vector con-
straint propagation represents directed inﬂuence, causation, or control that shapes which future
events are admissible. Entropy measures the degeneracy of admissible futures compatible with
a given history.
Together, these primitives deﬁne a semantic ﬁeld over histories rather than a
taxonomy over entities.
Crucially, this framework admits exclusion as a ﬁrst-class ontological operation. A history may
render entire classes of future events inadmissible, not merely unlikely or unasserted. This allows
refusal, commitment, and obligation to be modeled as structural features of the ontology itself,
rather than as annotations layered atop an entity-centric core.
11
Ontology Drift as an Entropic Phenomenon
One of the most persistent challenges in ontology engineering is ontology drift: the gradual failure
of mappings between ontologies, versions, or domains as systems evolve. Drift is typically treated
as an engineering problem arising from inconsistent updates, insuﬃcient governance, or inadequate
alignment practices. From a history-ﬁrst perspective, this diagnosis is incomplete.
Ontology drift is better understood as an entropic phenomenon. As histories branch and con-
straints accumulate, the space of admissible futures diverges.
Mappings that were valid under
earlier constraints may become inadmissible under later ones, not because of error, but because the
systems they describe have undergone irreversible diﬀerentiation.
Consider an ontology describing biological cell types across developmental time. Early in de-
velopment, classiﬁcations may be coarse and broadly compatible.
As diﬀerentiation proceeds,
commitments are made that rule out entire classes of futures. Attempting to preserve earlier iden-
tity mappings across these commitments leads to semantic incoherence. The failure is not in the
mapping, but in the assumption that identity can be preserved without accounting for history-
dependent exclusion.
The same pattern appears in machine learning systems whose internal representations evolve
through training. A model before and after ﬁne-tuning cannot be assumed to share identity in any
strong ontological sense, even if their architectures are identical. The training process constitutes
a sequence of irreversible commitments that reshape the models admissible behaviors. Treating
such systems as instances of a single enduring entity obscures the very dynamics that deﬁne their
operation.
By modeling ontology mappings as relations between histories rather than between entities,
drift becomes intelligible and predictable. Mappings fail when entropy exceeds the tolerance of
the invariant structure being tracked. This reframes ontology maintenance as the management of
entropy and constraint, rather than as a purely syntactic alignment task.

Embedding Entity-Centric Ontologies as Low-Entropy Subthe-
ories
The proposed event-historical ontology does not reject existing top-level ontologies such as the
Basic Formal Ontology (BFO); rather, it re-situates them as special cases within a broader semantic
landscape. Entity-centric ontologies can be understood as low-entropy subtheories of a history-ﬁrst
foundationdomains in which the space of admissible futures is suﬃciently constrained that identity
appears stable, persistence can be idealized, and irreversible diﬀerentiation is negligible over the
relevant timescale.
BFOs central distinction between continuants and occurrents exempliﬁes this regime. Continu-
ants are treated as entities that persist through time while maintaining identity, whereas occurrents
are processes in which these entities participate. From a history-ﬁrst perspective, this distinction
corresponds to a modeling choice in which certain historical commitments are collapsed into equiv-
alence classes that preserve identity across a bounded range of variation.
Persistence is not a
primitive fact, but a consequence of aggressive abstraction over admissible histories.
This abstraction is valid and useful in domains such as anatomy, materials science, and stable
engineering artifacts, where entropy is low and structural diﬀerentiation proceeds slowly relative
to observational needs. In such cases, treating entities as primary is not ontologically false but
pragmatically eﬃcient. The failure arises when this modeling stance is implicitly universalized and
applied to domains characterized by rapid diﬀerentiation, learning, or adaptive control.
Within the RSVP framework, BFO-style ontologies arise through a quotient operation over
histories that identiﬁes all variations below a given entropy threshold. The resulting ontology is
sharply deﬁned, monotonic, and well-suited to OWL-style reasoning. However, this quotient is lossy.
Once applied, it eliminates the semantic resources needed to reason about irreversible commitments,
refusal, or historical exclusion. As such, BFO is best understood not as a foundational ontology,
but as an interface ontology optimized for low-entropy regimes.
This reframing resolves a long-standing tension in ontology engineering. It explains both the
success of entity-centric ontologies in stable domains and their repeated breakdown when applied
to dynamic systems.
The issue is not that such ontologies are incomplete, but that they are
overextended beyond the regimes in which their abstractions remain faithful.
13
Worked Example: Ontology Versioning and Identity Drift
To illustrate the practical implications of a history-ﬁrst ontology, consider the problem of ontology
versioning in a scientiﬁc domain undergoing rapid conceptual change. Traditional approaches treat
successive ontology versions as revisions of a single enduring entity, linked by mappings that attempt
to preserve class identity wherever possible. When mappings fail, the failure is attributed to poor
alignment or insuﬃcient documentation.
In an event-historical framework, each ontology version is instead treated as a distinct stabilized
history, produced by a sequence of irreversible commitments. The introduction of a new class, the
redeﬁnition of an existing one, or the exclusion of a previously valid relation are all modeled as
5

events that prune the space of admissible futures. Identity across versions is therefore not assumed
but must be justiﬁed by demonstrating that suﬃcient invariant structure survives the accumulated
constraints.
Suppose an ontology initially deﬁnes a class RegulatoryProtein based on functional criteria. A
later revision incorporates structural constraints that exclude several proteins previously classiﬁed
under this term. In a state-based ontology, this produces a conﬂict: either identity is preserved at
the cost of incoherence, or identity is broken without formal justiﬁcation. In the history-ﬁrst model,
the later revision is recognized as having made commitments that render certain past classiﬁcations
inadmissible. The original class does not persist unchanged; it undergoes ontological diﬀerentiation.
Mappings between versions are thus relations between histories rather than between entities.
A mapping is valid only if the entropy introduced by the revision remains within the tolerance
bounds of the invariant being tracked. When this bound is exceeded, identity collapse is not an
error but an expected outcome. Ontology drift is thereby reinterpreted as a measurable divergence
in admissible futures rather than as a failure of alignment practice.
This approach provides clear guidance for ontology engineering. Rather than attempting to
force identity preservation, engineers can explicitly model points of irreversible divergence and
decide whether to introduce collapse operations that preserve continuity or to acknowledge the
emergence of genuinely new ontological structures.
14
Implications for Artiﬁcial Agents and Alignment
The relevance of irreversible histories extends beyond ontology engineering into the design and
analysis of artiﬁcial agents. Contemporary AI systems, particularly those based on autoregressive
or reinforcement learning paradigms, are typically modeled as state-based optimizers. Their internal
updates are treated as reversible adjustments to parameters rather than as ontologically binding
commitments.
From a history-ﬁrst perspective, this modeling choice explains a fundamental limitation of such
systems: their inability to sustain identity, obligation, or responsibility over time. An agent that
can always revise its internal state without structural consequence cannot meaningfully refuse an
action, bear the cost of a past decision, or bind itself to a future course. Its apparent behavior may
be coherent, but its ontology remains shallow.
An artiﬁcial agent exhibits agency in the strong sense only if it can make irreversible com-
mitments that constrain its future behavior. Training, alignment, and policy enforcement must
therefore be understood not merely as optimization processes, but as entropy-reduction operations
that stabilize identity across histories. An aligned agent is not one whose instantaneous outputs sat-
isfy constraints, but one whose admissible futures have been structurally shaped such that certain
actions are no longer possible.
This perspective has direct implications for alignment research. Safety mechanisms implemented
as external ﬁlters or reward modiﬁers remain fragile because they operate at the level of state
evaluation rather than historical exclusion. A history-ﬁrst ontology suggests that alignment must
be implemented as refusal at the level of admissible action spaces, embedded into the agents identity
6

rather than imposed episodically.
By grounding agency in irreversible history, the RSVP framework provides a principled way
to distinguish between systems that merely simulate deliberation and those that genuinely inhabit
a world shaped by their past. This distinction is essential for any ontology intended to support
reasoning about responsibility, trust, or long-term interaction with artiﬁcial systems.
15
Conclusion: Ontology as the Study of Admissible Futures
This paper has argued that irreversible histories, rather than static entities, should serve as the
primitive objects of ontology engineering.
By re-centering ontology on admissible histories un-
der constraint, the RSVP framework resolves persistent diﬃculties associated with irreversibility,
identity drift, and dynamic system behavior.
It explains why entity-centric ontologies succeed
in low-entropy domains while failing in regimes characterized by learning, adaptation, or social
interaction.
The central contribution is not the rejection of existing ontologies, but their contextualization.
Classical frameworks such as BFO are recovered as valid, low-entropy projections of a more general
history-ﬁrst semantics. OWL and Description Logic remain indispensable tools, but their limits
are rendered intelligible rather than anomalous.
More broadly, this work reframes ontology as the study of possible and impossible futures
rather than as a taxonomy of what exists. Meaning, identity, and agency emerge not from static
classiﬁcation, but from the irreversible commitments that shape what can no longer be otherwise.
In dynamic domainsfrom biology to artiﬁcial intelligence to social systemsthis shift is not optional.
It is a prerequisite for ontologies that remain faithful to the systems they seek to describe.
16
Limits of Description Logic and OWL Under Irreversibility
While the history-ﬁrst ontology proposed here is compatible with classical knowledge-representation
tools, it also exposes principled limits of Description Logic (DL) and the Web Ontology Language
(OWL). These limits are not implementation deﬁciencies but arise from deep semantic commitments
embedded in the logic itself.
OWL ontologies are founded on a model-theoretic semantics in which truth is evaluated relative
to interpretations that are static, monotonic, and extensional. Once a statement is entailed, it
remains entailed under ontology extension. This monotonicity property is essential for decidability
and tractable reasoning, but it implicitly assumes that ontological commitment is reversible only
by retraction at the meta-level. OWL lacks any internal notion of historical exclusion, refusal, or
commitment that permanently alters the space of admissible interpretations.
In contrast, an event-historical ontology treats commitment as an internal operation that
changes what can be said in the future.
A refusal is not a negated assertion but the elimina-
tion of an interpretation altogether.
Such operations cannot be faithfully represented in OWL
without reifying histories as individuals and simulating temporal constraint through ad hoc con-
structs. Doing so preserves syntactic expressivity but breaks semantic faithfulness, as the logic
7

continues to treat all admissible interpretations as contemporaneously possible.
This mismatch explains recurring pathologies in applied ontology engineering. Attempts to rep-
resent policy, obligation, governance, or identity over time typically resort to annotation properties,
temporal indices, or layered ontologies that simulate evolution while preserving a fundamentally
static core. These techniques work locally but fail compositionally. They cannot express that a
future state is impossible because of a past commitment, only that it is currently disallowed under
a contingent rule set.
From the RSVP perspective, OWL corresponds to a collapsed, low-entropy projection of a
richer semantic space. It is well-suited for reasoning within a ﬁxed regime of admissible futures,
but structurally incapable of representing transitions between regimes. This limitation is intrinsic,
not accidental, and clariﬁes why ontology engineers repeatedly encounter irreducible complexity
when modeling dynamic domains within purely description-logical frameworks.
17
A Hybrid Architecture: History Kernels with Logical Views
Rather than proposing the replacement of OWL or DL-based systems, this work motivates a strat-
iﬁed ontology architecture that separates irreversible commitment from logical inference. Such an
architecture mirrors the distinction already implicit in successful computational systems between
authoritative state and derived views.
At the base of the architecture lies a history kernel, responsible for maintaining the authoritative
event history. This kernel enforces authorization, refusal, and collapse operations, ensuring that all
extensions of the ontology respect irreversible commitments. The kernel is not queried directly by
users or reasoning engines; it functions as the causal substrate of the system.
Above this kernel sits a logical view layer, generated by projecting the current admissible histo-
ries into a static ontology suitable for OWL reasoning. This projection necessarily involves collapse:
distinctions that matter for future admissibility may be suppressed in order to support eﬃcient clas-
siﬁcation and entailment. Crucially, this collapse is explicit and one-way. Logical entailments never
feed back into the kernel as commitments.
In this architecture, OWL ontologies regain a clear and principled role. They are not global
truth-makers, but snapshots of a historically constrained semantic landscape. Reasoners operate
over these snapshots to answer questions about classiﬁcation, subsumption, and consistency within
the current regime. When regime changes occurthrough new commitments or refusalsthe view is
regenerated rather than incrementally patched.
This separation resolves several long-standing tensions in ontology engineering. It allows logical
inference to remain monotonic and decidable while enabling the underlying ontology to evolve irre-
versibly. It also prevents category errors in which normative or procedural constraints are mistak-
enly encoded as descriptive facts. Ethics, policy, and governance remain grounded in commitment
at the kernel level, while logic remains a tool for navigation within the resulting space.

18
Formal Identity Conditions Under Entropy Bounds
A central challenge for any ontology is the speciﬁcation of identity conditions. In entity-centric
frameworks, identity is typically treated as primitive or deﬁned via necessary and suﬃcient condi-
tions. This approach breaks down in dynamic domains, where the properties that deﬁne an entity
may change irreversibly.
The RSVP framework replaces static identity with entropy-bounded identity. Two histories are
said to represent the same entity if the divergence between their admissible futures remains below
a speciﬁed entropy threshold. Identity is thus neither absolute nor subjective, but parameterized
by tolerance to future diﬀerentiation.
Formally, let H1 and H2 be two event histories, and let F(H) denote the space of admissible
futures extending H. Deﬁne an entropy measure S(F(H)) over this space. Identity equivalence is
then deﬁned relative to a bound ϵ such that
|S(F(H1)) −S(F(H2))| ≤ϵ.
When this condition holds, the histories may be collapsed into a single identity for the purposes of
reasoning at that resolution. When it fails, identity diﬀerentiation is ontologically mandatory.
This formalization has immediate practical consequences. In ontology versioning, it provides
a principled criterion for when a class revision preserves identity versus when it introduces a new
ontological kind. In agent modeling, it distinguishes gradual learning from identity-altering commit-
ment. In biological ontology, it clariﬁes when developmental change preserves organismal identity
and when it produces diﬀerentiation.
By making identity explicitly dependent on entropy bounds, the framework avoids both rigid
essentialism and unrestricted relativism. Identity becomes a controlled abstraction, justiﬁed by
constraints on future divergence rather than by ﬁat.
19
Scope and Future Directions
The ontology of irreversible histories outlined here is intentionally ambitious. It seeks not merely
to patch deﬁciencies in existing frameworks, but to provide a unifying semantic foundation for
systems characterized by change, commitment, and constraint. While the present work has focused
on ontology engineering, the implications extend naturally to database systems, legal reasoning,
scientiﬁc modeling, and artiﬁcial intelligence.
Future work may pursue several directions. One is the formalization of kernel-level authorization
languages capable of expressing rich policy constraints while remaining computationally tractable.
Another is the development of tooling that supports bidirectional navigation between history kernels
and logical views, enabling ontology engineers to reason about both structure and evolution without
conﬂating them.
Perhaps most importantly, this framework invites a re-examination of what it means for an
ontology to be correct.
Correctness is no longer a matter of correspondence to a static world,
but of ﬁdelity to the irreversible structure of becoming. An ontology succeeds when it preserves
9

the constraints that make future reasoning coherent, even as the space of possibilities continues to
evolve.
In this sense, ontology engineering becomes inseparable from responsibility. To deﬁne what
exists is to rule out what cannot, and to do so irreversibly. A history-ﬁrst ontology does not merely
describe a world; it participates in its construction.
20
Why Temporal Ontologies Are Insuﬃcient
A natural objection to the event-historical framework is that existing temporal ontologies already
provide tools for representing change over time. Standards such as OWL-Time, perdurantist exten-
sions of BFO, and 4D-ﬂuent approaches all attempt to reconcile identity with temporal variation.
However, these frameworks ultimately preserve a state-based metaphysics and therefore fail to
capture irreversibility as an ontological primitive.
Temporal ontologies typically represent time as an additional index or dimension along which
properties vary. An entity is modeled as a sequence of time-slices or as a continuant that bears
diﬀerent properties at diﬀerent temporal coordinates. While this allows one to state that a property
held at time t1 and not at t2, it does not express that certain futures have been rendered inadmissible
by past events. All temporal slices are treated symmetrically as possible states of aﬀairs within the
same model.
In contrast, the event-historical framework treats time as asymmetric and constructive. Past
events are not merely earlier states but commitments that constrain the future. A refusal at time t
does not simply mean that an action is false at later times; it means that no admissible continuation
exists in which that action occurs. This distinction cannot be expressed in temporal description
logics without collapsing into meta-level reasoning about models rather than object-level ontology.
The insuﬃciency of temporal ontologies becomes especially apparent in domains involving gov-
ernance, policy, or institutional rules. For example, a regulation that permanently prohibits a class
of actions cannot be faithfully represented as a time-indexed predicate without losing its binding
force. The temporal encoding can express that the action is disallowed at all future times, but
it cannot represent the structural fact that the prohibition itself is an irreversible event whose
revocation would require a distinct counter-event. In RSVP terms, temporal ontologies describe
trajectories within a ﬁxed option-space, whereas event-historical ontologies describe transforma-
tions of the option-space itself.
21
Worked Example: Ontology Version Drift and Identity Failure
To illustrate the practical consequences of a history-ﬁrst ontology, consider the problem of ontol-
ogy version drift. In large-scale knowledge systems, ontologies evolve over time as deﬁnitions are
reﬁned, classes are split or merged, and constraints are added or removed. Classical ontology engi-
neering treats these changes as revisions to a theory, often assuming that backward compatibility
or mapping alignment can be achieved through correspondence axioms.
From an event-historical perspective, ontology evolution is a sequence of irreversible commit-
10

ments. Each release is not merely a new description but a constraint on future interpretations.
Consider an ontology O0 containing a class Person. At time t1, a revision introduces a commit-
ment distinguishing BiologicalPerson from LegalPerson. This is not merely an enrichment of
vocabulary; it permanently eliminates futures in which the undiﬀerentiated Person class remains
semantically adequate.
In a state-based framework, one attempts to map instances of Person in O0 to instances of the
new subclasses using alignment rules. However, such mappings frequently fail in practice because
the original data lacks the discriminative information required by the new ontology. This failure is
often attributed to data quality or modeling oversight.
The event-historical framework provides a deeper diagnosis.
The entropy of admissible fu-
tures has increased asymmetrically. The original ontology permitted a broader range of future
reﬁnements, whereas the revised ontology commits to a narrower interpretive regime. The failure
of mapping is not accidental; it is a consequence of an irreversible ontological commitment that
invalidates certain histories as continuations of the same identity.
Formally, let H0 denote the history up to ontology O0, and H1 = H0 · esplit denote the history
including the class-splitting event. The space of admissible futures F(H1) is not a reﬁnement of
F(H0) but a restriction. Attempting to map backward from H1 to H0 is therefore ill-typed unless
a collapse operation is explicitly authorized, identifying distinctions that are now known to be
semantically relevant.
This analysis explains why ontology alignment across versions often requires manual interven-
tion, normative judgment, or institutional authority. These are not engineering failures but signals
that identity has crossed an entropy threshold beyond which automatic reconciliation is no longer
ontologically sound.
22
Agent Identity and Commitment in Knowledge Systems
The same formalism applies to agent identity, whether biological, institutional, or artiﬁcial. Classi-
cal ontologies typically model agents as continuants with stable identiﬁers. Changes in beliefs, goals,
or capabilities are treated as property updates. This approach obscures the distinction between
learning and identity-altering commitment.
Within the event-historical framework, an agent is deﬁned by its history of commitments.
Learning corresponds to changes in texture within a ﬁxed kernel of admissible futures, whereas
commitment corresponds to events that alter the kernel itself. For example, an agent that adopts
a non-revocable policy constraintsuch as a constitutional prohibition or a hard safety boundaryun-
dergoes an identity transition.
This distinction is critical for modeling artiﬁcial agents and AI systems. A model that updates
weights through training but remains free to violate any prior behavior lacks commitment in the
ontological sense. By contrast, an agent that records refusals as irreversible constraints acquires a
form of identity that persists across future interactions.
Ontology engineering frameworks that fail to distinguish these cases risk conﬂating adaptive
behavior with accountable agency. The RSVP model provides formal criteria for when an agent
11

remains the same entity under change and when it becomes a diﬀerent one. Identity persistence is
not guaranteed by continuity of structure or function alone, but by bounded divergence in admissible
futures.
23
Implications for OWL-Based Tooling and Standards
The analysis presented here does not render OWL obsolete, but it does clarify its proper scope.
OWL excels at reasoning within stabilized, low-entropy domains where admissible futures are eﬀec-
tively ﬁxed. It is therefore well-suited for anatomical ontologies, taxonomies of material artifacts,
and other domains characterized by slow or negligible regime change.
However, when applied to domains involving governance, policy, cognition, or evolving tech-
nical systems, OWL must be embedded within a larger semantic architecture. In such settings,
OWL ontologies function as views over an event-historical substrate rather than as authoritative
representations of reality.
This perspective suggests concrete design principles for future ontology engineering platforms.
Reasoners should operate over snapshots generated by authorized collapse operations, and ontology
editors should make regime-changing commitments explicit rather than implicit. Versioning systems
should track entropy changes and signal when identity-preserving mappings are no longer justiﬁed.
Most importantly, ontology engineers should recognize that some disagreements cannot be re-
solved through better axiomatization because they concern incompatible commitments about ad-
missible futures. In such cases, negotiation, authority, or explicit refusal is ontologically prior to
logical reconciliation.
24
Conclusion: Ontology as the Science of Becoming
This work has argued that irreversible histories, rather than static entities, constitute the appropri-
ate primitives for ontology engineering in dynamic domains. By grounding ontology in constraint,
entropy, and commitment, the RSVP framework provides a uniﬁed account of identity, agency, and
meaning across physical, biological, cognitive, and computational systems.
The central shift is conceptual rather than technical. Ontology is no longer the study of what
exists, but of what can continue to exist given the commitments already made. Entities emerge as
stabilized patterns within histories, and meaning arises from the irreversible pruning of futures.
Such a framework does not simplify ontology engineering, but it renders its diﬃculties intelli-
gible. Mapping failures, alignment disputes, and semantic drift are not anomalies to be engineered
away; they are manifestations of genuine ontological change. Recognizing this allows ontology engi-
neers to move beyond brittle representational ﬁxes toward architectures that respect the asymmetry
of time and the cost of commitment.
In embracing irreversible history as ontological ground, we align ontology engineering with the
structure of the world it seeks to describe: a world that does not merely change, but becomes.

25
Formal Limits of Description Logic for Irreversible Histories
The preceding sections motivate an event-historical ontology at a conceptual level.
This sec-
tion establishes a more formal claim: that standard description logics, including those underlying
OWL 2 DL, are structurally incapable of representing irreversible commitments without external-
izing essential semantics to the meta-level.
OWL semantics are model-theoretic and monotonic.
Given an ontology O, adding axioms
can restrict the class of admissible interpretations, but no axiom can express that a particular
interpretation was once admissible and has now been rendered inadmissible by a historical event.
All admissibility is evaluated synchronically, relative to the completed axiom set. This collapses
the distinction between never possible and no longer possible, which is precisely the distinction that
event-historical ontologies require.
Formally, let I range over interpretations and let Ot denote an ontology at time t. In OWL,
entailment is deﬁned as
Ot |= ϕ
iﬀ
∀I ∈Mod(Ot), I |= ϕ.
There is no representation of the set diﬀerence Mod(Ot−1) \ Mod(Ot) as a ﬁrst-class object. Yet it
is exactly this diﬀerence that corresponds to an irreversible ontological commitment.
Attempting to encode irreversibility using time-indexed predicates merely pushes the problem
upward. One can state that a property holds at all times t ≥t0, but this still quantiﬁes over a
single, static model in which all times coexist. The semantics do not record that a rule itself was
introduced by an event, nor that its revocation would require a distinct counter-event. As a result,
OWL cannot distinguish between a law of nature and a law enacted yesterday.
This limitation can be stated as a theorem.
Proposition. There exists no OWL ontology O such that, for a class of actions A, the ontology
entails both (i) that A was admissible prior to some event e and (ii) that A is now inadmissible
because of e, without encoding e as an external meta-construct.
Sketch of proof. OWL entailment is invariant under permutation of axioms. If the inadmis-
sibility of A is entailed, it is entailed timelessly. Any reference to a change in admissibility must
therefore be represented as a change in ontology, not within ontology. The causal force of the event
cannot be internalized.
This result clariﬁes why ontology versioning, governance, and policy systems built on OWL
inevitably rely on procedural overlays, human authority, or ad hoc annotations. The ontology itself
lacks the expressive power to say why something is forbidden now rather than merely asserting that
it is forbidden.

A Worked OWL Encoding and Its Failure Mode
To make this limitation concrete, consider an attempt to encode commitment and refusal in OWL.
Suppose we introduce the following classes and properties:
Class: Action
Class: RefusedAction SubClassOf: Action
13

ObjectProperty: forbids
Domain: Event
Range: Action
One might attempt to model refusal by asserting that an event forbids an action, and that
forbidden actions are inadmissible. However, OWL provides no semantics for inadmissibility. At
best, one can assert that forbidden actions are instances of a class with no allowed realizations, but
this immediately leads to inconsistency rather than structured exclusion.
Alternatively, one might try to encode admissibility using modal-style patterns, introducing a
class AdmissibleAction and axioms stating that certain actions are no longer admissible after an
event. Yet OWL lacks event ordering and cannot express that admissibility is evaluated relative to
a history preﬁx. Any such encoding either collapses into contradiction or degenerates into a static
taxonomy of permitted versus forbidden actions.
By contrast, in an event-historical ontology, refusal is not a predicate on actions but a transfor-
mation of the future space. The formal object is not a class inclusion but a rewrite of admissible
continuations:
F(H · refuse(A)) = F(H) \ {h′ | A ∈enabled(h′)}.
This operation has no analogue in description logic, because it is not truth-functional. It is con-
structive and asymmetric in time.
The practical implication is that OWL ontologies can describe outcomes of commitment, but
not commitment itself. They can assert that an action is disallowed, but not that it has been
disallowed by an irreversible act whose legitimacy, scope, and authority matter.
27
Toward a Two-Layer Ontology Architecture
The preceding analysis suggests a principled architectural resolution. Rather than extending OWL
to do what it cannot, ontology engineering should adopt a two-layer design.
At the lower layer lies an event-historical kernel, responsible for recording commitments, re-
fusals, and collapses as irreversible transformations of admissible futures. This kernel operates over
histories, not states, and enforces authorization rules that are sensitive to the entire preﬁx of prior
events. It is at this level that identity, accountability, and power are grounded.
At the upper layer lie classical ontologies expressed in OWL or related formalisms.
These
function as stabilized views generated by authorized collapse operations. They support eﬃcient
reasoning, classiﬁcation, and interoperability precisely because they abstract away historical detail.
Crucially, however, they are no longer treated as ontologically complete. Their authority is derived,
not primitive.
This stratiﬁcation mirrors the separation already present in many successful systems, but makes
it explicit and principled. Version control systems distinguish commits from working trees; legal
systems distinguish enacted law from codiﬁed statutes; distributed systems distinguish logs from
materialized views. The RSVP framework uniﬁes these practices under a single ontological theory.
14

28
Ontology Engineering as Governance of Futures
A ﬁnal implication follows from taking irreversible histories seriously: ontology engineering becomes
a normative discipline. Choosing an ontology is not merely choosing a vocabulary; it is choosing
which futures remain intelligible and which are foreclosed.
When an ontology introduces a new distinction, deprecates a class, or enforces a constraint,
it is performing a pop or refuse operation in the semantic space of its users.
These acts have
downstream consequences for data integration, institutional practice, and agent behavior. Treating
ontology evolution as a purely technical activity obscures its role as a form of governance.
The event-historical framework provides tools for making this governance explicit. It allows
ontology engineers to ask not only whether a model is consistent, but what commitments it makes
irreversible, which identities it stabilizes, and which trajectories it excludes. This reframes de-
bates about realism versus pragmatism, or universality versus context, in operational rather than
metaphysical terms.
29
Closing Remarks
By extending ontology engineering beyond entity-centric and state-based assumptions, the RSVP
framework oﬀers a way to reconcile formal rigor with the realities of change, power, and agency.
Its insistence on irreversible history does not reject classical ontologies, but situates them within a
broader theory of becoming.
In domains where the past binds the future, ontology cannot be timeless. It must remember
not only what is true, but what has been made impossible. Only then can it faithfully represent
the structures it seeks to describe.

A
Admissible Histories and Entropy-Bounded Identity
This appendix provides a formal speciﬁcation of admissible histories and clariﬁes the role of en-
tropy as an ontological regulator of identity persistence. The goal is to make precise the sense in
which RSVP treats identity not as an intrinsic property of entities, but as a constraint-stabilized
phenomenon that exists only within bounded regions of historical possibility.
Let E be a countable set of event types, and let H denote the set of all ﬁnite event sequences
over E. A history h ∈H is a totally ordered sequence
h = ⟨e1, e2, . . . , en⟩.
Histories are preﬁx-closed: if h ∈H, then every preﬁx of h is also in H. This preﬁx structure
induces a partial order (H, ⪯), where h ⪯h′ if and only if h is a preﬁx of h′.
Admissibility is deﬁned relative to a constraint function
A : H →P(E),
where A(h) denotes the set of event types admissible after history h. A history h · e is admissible if
and only if e ∈A(h). This deﬁnition is intentionally non-Markovian: A may depend on the entire
history, not merely on a bounded suﬃx or summary state.
Entropy enters the ontology through the cardinality and structure of admissible continuations.
For a history h, deﬁne its future set
F(h) = {h′ ∈H | h ⪯h′}.
The entropy S(h) of a history is a measure of the degeneracy of F(h) under an appropriate equiv-
alence relation ∼, which identiﬁes futures that are indistinguishable with respect to stabilized in-
variants. Intuitively, S(h) quantiﬁes how many materially distinct ways the world may still unfold
given the commitments already made.
Identity in RSVP is not binary but regime-based. An identity predicate I is said to persist
across a set of histories HI ⊆H if and only if the entropy of admissible futures consistent with I
remains below a threshold ϵI:
∀h ∈HI,
S(h | I) ≤ϵI.
When entropy exceeds this bound, identity dissolvesnot because an entity ceases to exist, but
because the constraints required to distinguish it from alternatives can no longer be maintained.
This formalism explains why identity is robust in low-entropy domains, such as classical me-
chanics or well-governed databases, and fragile in high-entropy domains, such as evolving machine
learning systems or socio-technical institutions. Ontological failure in these domains is not an error
of representation but a consequence of unconstrained future branching.
16

B
Comparison with BFO: Continuants, Occurrents, and the Fail-
ure of Time Symmetry
The Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) distinguishes between continuants, which persist through time,
and occurrents, which unfold in time. While this distinction captures an important phenomenolog-
ical diﬀerence, it presupposes that persistence itself is primitive. RSVP rejects this assumption.
In RSVP, there are no primitive continuants. What BFO calls a continuant corresponds to
a region of history space in which entropy remains suﬃciently low that certain invariants are
preserved across admissible futures.
Occurrents, meanwhile, correspond to sequences of events
that restructure the admissible future space. The diﬀerence is quantitative and dynamical, not
categorical.
This reconceptualization resolves several long-standing tensions in BFO-based ontology engi-
neering. First, it eliminates the need for special persistence conditions attached to continuants.
Persistence becomes an emergent property of constraint maintenance rather than a metaphysical
axiom. Second, it provides a principled account of identity failure over time, such as in ontology
version drift or organizational change, without invoking vague notions of partial survival.
Most importantly, RSVP rejects the implicit time symmetry present in BFO. In BFO, an
occurrent is fully speciﬁed by its temporal extent, and nothing in the formalism distinguishes the
past from the future. In RSVP, by contrast, the asymmetry between past and future is foundational.
Past events are ﬁxed preﬁxes; future events are constrained possibilities. This asymmetry is what
allows RSVP to represent commitment, responsibility, and power as ontological phenomena rather
than external annotations.
C
Ontology Versioning as Entropic Divergence
A persistent problem in ontology engineering is version drift: the failure of mappings between
successive ontology versions to preserve meaning. Traditional accounts treat this as a problem of
alignment or expressivity. RSVP reframes it as an entropic phenomenon.
Let O1 and O2 be successive ontology versions derived from a common ancestor. In a state-based
view, one seeks a mapping f : O1 →O2 that preserves truth conditions. In an event-historical
view, the relevant object is the divergence of admissible futures induced by the changes.
Ontology evolution introduces new constraints and relaxes others, thereby reshaping A(h) for
users operating under the ontology. When the induced future sets F1(h) and F2(h) diverge beyond
a tolerable entropy bound, semantic alignment fails. This failure is not accidental. It reﬂects the
fact that the two ontologies no longer govern the same space of possible practices.
This analysis explains why backward compatibility is costly and why ontology governance in-
evitably involves political and institutional negotiation. Aligning ontologies is not merely aligning
vocabularies; it is aligning futures.
17

D
Agent Identity and Learning Systems
The RSVP framework has direct implications for modeling agent identity, particularly in artiﬁcial
learning systems. A learning agent is not deﬁned by its parameter state at a moment in time,
but by the irreversible commitments encoded in its training history, architectural constraints, and
deployment context.
Standard machine learning models obscure this reality by allowing retraining, ﬁne-tuning, and
rollback without ontological consequence. RSVP insists that genuine agency requires the capacity
to refuse certain updates, preserve commitments, and incur irreversible costs. An agent that can
always be reset has no history in the ontological sense.
This observation clariﬁes why alignment, once achieved, is fragile under retraining, and why
accountability cannot be grounded in state snapshots or loss functions. Only systems that maintain
low-entropy identity across timeby constraining their own future update spacecan be meaningfully
said to act.
E
Concluding Perspective
Taken together, these formal developments reinforce the central thesis of this work: ontology is
not the study of what exists, but of what can still happen. By grounding ontology in irreversible
histories rather than static entities, RSVP provides a uniﬁed foundation for representing identity,
agency, power, and meaning across domains.
The price of this uniﬁcation is the abandonment of timelessness. Ontologies built on RSVP
must remember not only their current commitments, but how those commitments came to be, and
what alternatives were permanently ruled out along the way. This burden is not a defect. It is the
cost of realism in a world where the past cannot be undone.
F
OWL Expressivity and the Limits of State-Based Description
The contrast between RSVP and mainstream ontology engineering becomes especially clear when
considered through the lens of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL is fundamentally grounded
in description logic, which is explicitly state-based, monotonic, and model-theoretic. An ontology
in OWL speciﬁes a set of constraints that deﬁne a class of admissible models, but it does not na-
tively represent how one model becomes another, nor does it encode irreversible transitions between
models.
From an RSVP perspective, this is not a minor technical limitation but a categorical mismatch.
OWL assumes that ontological truth is timeless and that inference expands knowledge monotoni-
cally. By contrast, RSVP assumes that ontological structure is produced through irreversible events
that both add and remove admissible futures. In other words, OWL reasons over what is true in all
possible worlds, while RSVP reasons over which possible worlds have been permanently excluded.
This distinction manifests concretely in several well-known OWL limitations. OWL lacks a
native notion of negation-as-refusal. While one may assert that an individual is not a member of
a class, this assertion does not prevent future axioms from reintroducing that membership under
18

open-world semantics. In RSVP terms, OWL supports weak negation but not strong exclusion.
There is no construct corresponding to an irreversible deletion of futures.
Similarly, OWL cannot represent path-dependent constraints. Class membership and property
assertions are evaluated pointwise in a model, not relative to the history of prior assertions. As a
result, OWL cannot naturally encode commitments such as this agent once violated constraint C
and therefore may never perform action A again. Any attempt to do so requires reiﬁcation of time
or ad hoc provenance annotations, which remain semantically external to the logic.
This analysis suggests that OWL ontologies can be faithfully embedded within RSVP only under
conditions of aggressive collapse, where historical detail is intentionally erased and only present-
tense constraints are retained.
In this sense, OWL corresponds to a low-entropy projection of
an event-historical ontology, suitable for stable domains but structurally incapable of representing
irreversible dynamics.
G
An Event-Historical OWL Proﬁle
Despite these limitations, RSVP does not reject OWL outright. Instead, it provides a principled
account of what OWL can and cannot represent, and how it may be used as a derived layer within
a larger event-historical architecture.
One may deﬁne an RSVPOWL proﬁle in which OWL axioms are interpreted not as eternal
truths, but as collapse-stable invariants over histories. In this proﬁle, an OWL class corresponds
to an equivalence class of histories whose admissible futures preserve a given invariant. Property
assertions describe constraints that hold across all histories within that equivalence class, but say
nothing about how those histories were produced.
Under this interpretation, ontology versioning becomes a sequence of collapse and reﬁnement
operations rather than a simple replacement of axioms. Introducing a new OWL axiom corresponds
to a pop event that excludes histories incompatible with the new constraint. Deprecating an axiom
does not restore excluded histories; it merely collapses distinctions among surviving ones. This
asymmetry captures the irreversibility of conceptual change that OWL itself cannot express.
Reasoning in such a proﬁle remains decidable because OWL reasoning is applied only after
collapse. The event-historical machinery operates outside the description logic, governing which
collapsed models are admissible at all. This stratiﬁcation preserves computational tractability while
restoring ontological realism.
H
Worked Example: Identity Drift in a Learning Model Ontology
To illustrate the advantages of an event-historical ontology, consider the problem of representing the
identity of a machine learning model across retraining cycles. In conventional ontology engineering,
a model instance is identiﬁed by a URI, with properties describing architecture, training data, and
performance metrics. Retraining is modeled either as a new instance or as an update to the existing
one, with no principled criterion for identity preservation.
Within RSVP, this ambiguity dissolves. Each training run is an irreversible event that alters
19

the admissible future behavior of the system. Let h0 denote the history up to initial deployment,
and let etrain denote a retraining event. The post-training history h1 = h0 · etrain admits a future
space F(h1) that is generally incomparable to F(h0).
Identity persistence is evaluated by comparing the entropy of divergence between these future
spaces. If the retraining preserves a bounded set of invariantssuch as safety constraints or task
scopethen the entropy increase may remain below the identity threshold ϵI, and the model may be
treated as the same agent. If not, identity fails, and the retrained system is ontologically distinct,
regardless of naming conventions.
This criterion explains why ﬁne-tuning for robustness may preserve identity, while retraining
on a new objective function does not. It also clariﬁes why accountability cannot be transferred
automatically across model updates: responsibility attaches to histories, not labels.
I
Ontology Engineering as Constraint Design
The RSVP framework ultimately reframes ontology engineering itself as a form of constraint design.
Ontologists are not merely cataloging what exists; they are shaping the space of admissible futures
for reasoning systems, organizations, and agents.
In this view, an ontology is successful not when it achieves maximal coverage or expressivity,
but when it stabilizes meaning under expected entropy loads. Low-entropy domains beneﬁt from
rigid, entity-centric ontologies. High-entropy domains require ﬂexible, history-aware formalisms
that can tolerate identity drift and semantic reconﬁguration without collapsing into inconsistency.
RSVP provides the conceptual and formal tools to navigate this design space.
By treating
irreversibility as primitive, it aligns ontology engineering with the realities of computation, social
organization, and physical law. It explains why certain ontologies fail, not as a matter of poor
modeling, but because they attempt to impose timeless structure on processes that are intrinsically
historical.
J
Closing Remarks
This document has extended the RSVP framework into the domain of formal ontology engineering,
demonstrating how irreversibility, entropy, and history can serve as ontological primitives.
By
situating existing standards such as BFO and OWL as low-entropy subtheories, RSVP preserves
their utility while revealing their limits.
More importantly, it oﬀers a path forward. As artiﬁcial agents become adaptive, institutions
become ﬂuid, and knowledge systems evolve continuously, ontology must move beyond static entity
catalogs. It must become a theory of admissible histories.
Irreversible histories are not an inconvenience to be abstracted away. They are the substrate
from which meaning, agency, and reality itself are built.
20

K
Outlook: Toward Entropy-Aware Ontology Tooling
If ontology engineering is reconceived as the design of admissible histories rather than the enumer-
ation of entities, then the practical tooling that supports ontology work must also evolve. Current
ontology development environments, reasoners, and version-control practices implicitly assume that
ontologies are static artifacts punctuated by reversible edits. RSVP suggests instead that ontology
evolution is itself an irreversible process that accumulates commitments over time.
One immediate implication is the inadequacy of conventional diﬀ-based ontology versioning.
Textual or axiom-level diﬀs obscure the semantic fact that some changes permanently foreclose in-
terpretations that were once admissible. An RSVP-aligned toolchain would treat ontology revisions
as ﬁrst-class events, recording not only what axioms were added or removed, but which regions of
semantic possibility space were irrevocably excluded as a result. Rollback, in such a system, would
be understood not as restoration but as the creation of a new branch whose future is constrained
by the memory of what has already been ruled out.
Reasoning services would likewise become stratiﬁed. At the lowest level, standard OWL rea-
soners could still be employed, operating over collapsed representations to answer local consistency
and entailment queries eﬃciently. Above this layer, an event-historical controller would manage
authorization, refusal, and collapse, determining which ontology states are even admissible inputs
to description-logic reasoning.
This separation preserves decidability where it is possible while
acknowledging that not all ontological questions are reducible to timeless inference.
L
Relation to Upper Ontologies and Foundational Categories
The RSVP framework also clariﬁes the role of traditional upper ontologies such as BFO. These
systems excel at providing stable categoriesobject, process, role, dispositionthat support interoper-
ability across biomedical and scientiﬁc domains. RSVP does not dispute their internal coherence;
rather, it explains why their success is domain-bounded.
Upper ontologies function eﬀectively where entropy is low and where identity conditions are
relatively stable across time. In such regimes, collapse can be applied aggressively without seman-
tic loss. RSVP predicts, however, that as domains become more dynamicincorporating learning
systems, adaptive organizations, or socio-technical infrastructuresupper ontologies will increasingly
require ad hoc extensions to manage change, provenance, and exception handling. These extensions
are symptoms of an underlying mismatch between entity-ﬁrst modeling and history-ﬁrst reality.
Within RSVP, upper ontologies can be reinterpreted as coordinate charts on a deeper manifold
of histories. They provide locally useful parameterizations but cannot serve as global foundations.
This perspective opens the possibility of principled ontology translation: rather than mapping
entities to entities, one maps invariants preserved under collapse.
Translation failure, on this
account, is not an engineering defect but an entropic divergence between domains.
21

M
Implications for Governance, Compliance, and Alignment
Beyond technical ontology engineering, the RSVP approach has direct implications for governance
and alignment in computational systems. Regulatory frameworks increasingly require traceability,
accountability, and auditability, particularly in AI-driven decision systems. These requirements are
fundamentally historical: they concern not only what a system did, but how it came to be in a
position to do it.
State-based ontologies struggle to meet these demands because they treat compliance as a
property of current conﬁgurations. RSVP instead treats compliance as a property of histories. A
system is compliant if its entire lineage of commitments respects speciﬁed constraints. Violations
are not transient states but irreversible events that alter the systems admissible future actions.
This reframing aligns naturally with concepts such as revocation of authority, loss of certiﬁ-
cation, and institutional memory. Once a constraint is violated, certain futures are permanently
disallowed. Attempting to reset the system without acknowledging this history is not a neutral act;
it is a collapse that must itself be authorized. Ontology thus becomes an instrument of governance,
encoding not just categories but consequences.
N
Limits and Open Problems
The RSVP framework is deliberately ambitious, and several open problems remain. Chief among
them is the formal integration of entropy measures with existing logical frameworks in a way that
preserves computational feasibility. While RSVP provides conceptual clarity, practical deployment
will require careful approximation strategies and domain-speciﬁc thresholds.
Another challenge lies in user interaction. History-ﬁrst ontologies demand new metaphors for
understanding identity, change, and responsibility.
The cognitive load imposed by explicit ir-
reversibility may be nontrivial, especially for practitioners accustomed to reversible editing and
abstraction. Designing interfaces that expose historical commitment without overwhelming users
is an open design problem.
Finally, there is the question of empirical validation. RSVP makes strong claims about why cer-
tain ontology eﬀorts succeed or fail in practice. These claims invite systematic study across domains
such as biomedical informatics, AI lifecycle management, and socio-technical system modeling.
O
Conclusion
By extending ontology engineering into the domain of irreversible histories, RSVP oﬀers a coherent
response to long-standing diﬃculties in representing change, agency, and meaning.
It reframes
ontologies not as mirrors of a static world, but as instruments that actively shape which worlds
remain possible.
The central lesson is austere but generative: ontology cannot remain neutral with respect to
time. Every representational choice excludes futures, whether acknowledged or not. RSVP simply
insists that we take responsibility for those exclusions.
22

Irreversible histories are not an optional complication to be engineered away. They are the
ontological ground on which any realistic theory of meaning, agency, or intelligence must stand.
