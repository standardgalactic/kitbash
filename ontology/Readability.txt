Readability Is Freedom: A Case Against
Proprietary Math Empires A Philosophical Defense of
Open-Source Computation
Prologue: The Emperors Equation
In 1675, Gottfried Leibniz fought to keep calculus free from Isaac Newtons proprietary grip, knowing
that monopolies on mathematics choke progress.1 Today, we face a similar battlenot between men,
but between computational languages. Proprietary systems like Wolfram Language and MATLAB
promise insight but deliver control, locking knowledge behind paywalls and opaque syntax. This
essay is a case against these math empires and a defense of open-source alternatives like Python,
which embody skepticism, accessibility, and communal progress. Readability is not just a technical
virtueits a political act of resistance.
1. Python Is a Gift, Not a Gate
When Guido van Rossum released Python in 1991, he didnt just create a languagehe gifted a tool
to the world.2 Pythons open-source ethos built a community, not a walled economy. Libraries like
NumPy, SymPy, and SciPy democratized numerical and symbolic computation, oﬀering free, trans-
parent alternatives to proprietary giants.3 Contrast this with Wolfram Language and MATLAB,
which monetize access to their toolchains, turning science into a subscription service.
Wolframs symbolic algebra and MATLABs matrix operations are powerful, but their price is obe-
dience. Want to know how DSolve[] works? Good luckyoull need a license and a prayer. Python,
meanwhile, invites you to peek under the hood with numpy.source() or fork SymPys symbolic
engine on GitHub. This isnt just a technical diﬀerenceits a philosophy of access. Python says,
Heres the code. Make it yours. Wolfram and MATLAB say, Pay up and trust us.
2. Culture of Parsimony vs. Proprietary Overload
Python thrives on parsimony. Its libraries are modular, each doing one thing well: NumPy for
arrays, SymPy for algebra, Matplotlib for plots. This simplicity invites participationanyone can
learn, tweak, or extend a library.4 Wolfram Language, by contrast, is a monolith, built around
Stephen Wolframs singular vision of computation.5 Its syntax, while English-like, is esoteric, with

idioms that only make sense within Wolframs paradigm. Try debugging a CompiledFunction[...]
output, and youre met with a black box.
Pythons artiﬁcialitykeywords like def, import, lambdais its strength.
It doesnt pretend to be
natural; its a tool, legible and honest. Wolframs faux readability is a trap, masking proprietary
operations as inevitable truths. Pythons clarity fosters collaboration; Wolframs opacity demands
allegiance.
3. Personal Vision vs. Economic Extraction
Every language reﬂects its creators vision, but the diﬀerence lies in what happens next. Van Rossum
shaped Pythons minimalist syntax but stepped down as its Benevolent Dictator for Life in 2018,
letting the community steer its future.6 His humility birthed a living language. Stephen Wolfram,
by contrast, remains the eternal prophet of his language, embedding his ontologyand egointo its
syntax.7 MATLAB, meanwhile, evolved under corporate custodianship, not communal governance,
prioritizing proﬁt over accessibility.8
Wolfram didnt just build a languagehe built a kingdom with toll booths. Every function, every
update, every computational essay reinforces his brand. Python built a playground with toolboxes,
where anyone can tinker, teach, or transform. This is the diﬀerence between a commons and a
chokepoint.
4. Ecosystem as Commons vs. Ecosystem as Brand
Pythons ecosystem is a distributed, open-source commons. Libraries are maintained by volunteers,
academics, and coders worldwide, aligned with the ethos of science as a shared endeavor.9 The
Wolfram ecosystem is centralized, closed-source, and dominated by a single author. Its toolsWol-
framAlpha, Mathematica, the Wolfram Cloudare extensions of a brand, not a community.10
Python became a lingua franca because it prioritized collaboration over control. Its libraries are
battle-tested by millions, from students in Nairobi to researchers in Peru, who can fork and adapt
without permission. Wolframs cult dialect, by contrast, thrives on exclusivity, its logic locked behind
licenses and paywalls. Science demands pluralism; Wolfram oﬀers a monarchy.
5. The Fork Test: A Litmus for Freedom
Heres a simple test for any computational tool: Can a scientist in a resource-constrained lab rewrite
part of the engine to ﬁt local needswithout fees or gatekeepers? If the answer is no, its dogma

dressed as software.11 Python passes with ﬂying colorsits source code is open, its libraries forkable.
Wolfram and MATLAB fail spectacularly, their internals sealed like royal vaults.
The right to fork is the right to dissent. If you cant audit the code, you cant trust the method. If
you cant debug, youre not free. Proprietary systems dont just limit accessthey limit skepticism, the
heartbeat of scientiﬁc progress.
6. Readability Is a Political Virtue
Readable code is more than maintainableits liberating. It invites critique, sharing, and reinvention.
Opaque systems, by contrast, are epistemic weapons, extracting rent from ignorance and treating
trust as a commodity.12
Pythons transparencyits open source ﬁles, clear syntax, and modular
designmakes knowledge a commons, not a kingdom. Wolframs opacity turns computation into a
priesthood, where only the anointed understand the rituals.
If science is a collective pursuit, its tools must be inspectable. If truth is the goal, the code must
be as open as the questions it answers.
Epilogue: A Skeptics Creed
We reject: - Brilliance that hides its logic. - Founders who play prophet. - Knowledge sold without
scrutiny.
We demand: - Auditable code. - Transparent syntax. - The freedom to fork.
Math is a path to truth, not a product to be leased. Resist the empires of opacity. Fork some-
thing. Teach with open tools. Demand show me over trust me. The future of computationand
sciencedepends on it.
Draw your own map. Start now.
