Entropic Paradoxes in Big Tech Critique: A Formal Analysis
Through the RSVP Framework

September 4, 2025
Abstract
Critiquing big tech and chokepoint capitalism is inherently paradoxical, as critics rely on the very
platforms they oppose. This essay introduces the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework
to formalize these contradictions as entropic trade-offs between local coherence and global dispersion.
Drawing on category theory, sheaf theory, and empirical case studies, including LinkedIn's extractive
model and Cory Doctorow's critique of tech exceptionalism, we model how local efforts are absorbed by
global systems. The framework is rigorously defined, tested against real-world examples, and compared
to existing approaches to highlight its unique contributions. By focusing on a single, clear argument, we
demonstrate how paradoxes are systemic invariants and propose strategies for effective critique.

Introduction
In an era dominated by digital infrastructure, big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Meta, and Apple
wield unprecedented control over communication, commerce, and information dissemination. These corpo-
rations, alongside other monopolistic entities, form the backbone of what is termed chokepoint capitalism—a
system where a few dominant players control critical junctures of economic and social activity, extracting
disproportionate value while limiting competition and innovation. However, critiquing these entities presents
a paradox: the very platforms and tools controlled by big tech—social media, email services, cloud storage,
and search engines—are indispensable for publicizing and disseminating such criticism.
This essay explores that paradox in three layers: first, the practical and economic contradictions of
anti-tech critique; second, a deeper RSVP-based interpretation of these contradictions as thermodynamic
and categorical phenomena; and third, the role of unique conceptual "signatures" in preserving intellectual
identity within systems that demand uniformity.
The dominance of big tech companies—such as Google, Amazon, Meta, and Apple—has created "choke-
point capitalism," where a few corporations control critical economic and informational junctures [1]. Critics
highlight their monopolistic practices, exploitation of creators, and privacy violations, yet face a paradox:
they must use these centralized infrastructures to reach audiences. For example, campaigns against Ama-
zon's labor practices rely on X or AWS-hosted websites, reinforcing the systems they critique [2]. Similarly,
platforms like LinkedIn promote illusory success, akin to vanity presses, extracting value from users' aspira-
tions [16, 19]. Cory Doctorow argues that tech exceptionalism—the belief that technology is exempt from
normal rules—drives this consolidation, enabled by lax antitrust enforcement [2].
This essay addresses why these contradictions are inevitable and how they can be formally understood.
Existing frameworks, such as network theory or complexity science, model information flows or economic
dynamics but fail to capture the entropic interplay between local resistance and global systemic reinforcement
[3]. We introduce the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, which models critique as a
balance of local coherence (negentropy) and global dispersion (entropy). RSVP uses scalar, vector, and
entropic fields to describe how critical efforts propagate and interact with systemic constraints, offering
predictive insights not readily available in existing models.
Our thesis is that these paradoxes, including the illusory success promoted by big tech, are systemic
invariants, arising from entropic trade-offs formalized by RSVP. We ground the framework in empirical case
studies, such as the 2025 Google antitrust case, X-based activism, and LinkedIn's extractive model, and use
category theory to provide mathematical rigor.

Part I: The Practical Paradox of Criticizing Big Tech
2.1
Dependency on Big Tech Infrastructure
The first major obstacle to critiquing big tech lies in the reliance on their infrastructure for communication
and outreach. Social media platforms like X, Facebook, and Instagram, owned by a handful of corporations,
are primary channels for reaching global audiences. For instance, an essay or campaign criticizing Amazon's
labor practices or Google's data privacy violations must often be shared via these platforms to gain traction.
Similarly, email services such as Gmail or cloud storage solutions like Google Drive or Dropbox are critical
for collaboration, document sharing, and organizing advocacy efforts. This dependency creates a paradox:
to challenge the dominance of big tech, critics must utilize the very tools these companies provide, thereby
reinforcing their influence.
This reliance extends beyond communication to operational necessities. Independent journalists, activists,
or scholars often lack the resources to host their own servers or develop alternative platforms. Hosting a
website to publish critical content requires domain registration, web hosting, and cybersecurity measures,
many of which are dominated by companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Cloudflare. AWS alone
powers a significant portion of the internet, making it nearly impossible to operate online without indirectly
supporting big tech.
2.2
Risks of Censorship and Suppression
Big tech's control over digital platforms introduces the risk of censorship or suppression. Algorithms and
moderation policies can limit the visibility of content deemed controversial or unprofitable. Posts criticizing
a platform's business model may be demoted in algorithms, flagged as misinformation, or removed entirely
under vague terms of service violations. This gatekeeping power stifles dissent, as critics must navigate the
fine line between impactful critique and content that risks being throttled or banned.
2.3
Barriers to Independent Alternatives
One might argue that the solution lies in creating independent platforms free from big tech's influence.
However, building and sustaining such alternatives is fraught with challenges. Developing a social media
platform, email service, or cloud storage solution requires significant capital, technical expertise, and in-
frastructure—resources that are often out of reach for small organizations or individuals. Even when such
platforms are created, they face the daunting task of competing with established giants that benefit from
network effects.
Critiques of big tech highlight six key paradoxes, each illustrating the tension between local intent and
global systemic effects:
1. Centralization vs. Decentralization: Advocates for decentralized systems, like Mastodon, rely on
centralized platforms (e.g., GitHub) [7].
2. Innovation vs. Control: Open standards, like IPFS, depend on ISP-controlled infrastructure [8].
3. Transparency vs.
Surveillance: Privacy campaigns against Meta's tracking use data-collecting
platforms [9].
4. Ethical Intent vs. Economic Incentives: Critiques of Spotify's artist payouts are disseminated
via profit-driven platforms [10].
5. Illusory Success vs. Extractive Reality: Platforms like LinkedIn promote universal professional
success, yet while 122 million users have received interviews through the platform, only 35.5 million
have secured jobs, implying a low success rate among its 61 million weekly job seekers, mirroring vanity
presses [17, 18, 19].
6. Tech Exceptionalism vs. Monopolistic Harm: Doctorow argues that tech exceptionalism—the
belief that technology transcends normal rules—has enabled monopolies through lax antitrust enforce-
ment, creating autocrats of trade [2]. For example, Amazon's predatory pricing and Google's search
2

dominance stem from the consumer welfare standard, which prioritizes low prices over broader societal
harms.
These paradoxes manifest in real-world cases. The 2025 Google antitrust case saw X-based critiques
increase platform engagement [11]. Activists using ProtonMail against Amazon rely on AWS servers [12].
LinkedIn's low job placement rate extracts value from subscriptions [17].
Doctorow's The Internet Con
critiques how tech exceptionalism, driven by Robert Bork's consumer welfare standard, has concentrated
power, a dynamic RSVP formalizes as local innovation (lamphron) dispersing into monopolistic reinforcement
(lamphrodyne) [2].
Existing frameworks, like network theory, model influence graphs but miss entropic trade-offs [4]. Com-
plexity science addresses emergent behaviors but not directional flows [5]. RSVP captures these dynamics,
predicting how critique strengthens platforms.

Part II: RSVP-Theoretic Interpretation — Contradiction as an
Entropic Law
The contradictions of anti-tech critique can be seen not merely as social dynamics but as thermodynamic
invariants in a relational system. Within the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, every
act of critique creates a local negentropic structure—a lamphron—representing coherence and order (orga-
nized resistance, alternative tools, new norms). But the infrastructure that carries this critique—platforms,
protocols, algorithms—acts as a lamphrodyne, dispersing entropy globally.
We can formalize this paradox in RSVP terms:
∆Slocal + ∆Sglobal = 0
A local decrease in entropy (organized resistance) forces a compensatory global increase (platform en-
gagement, data capture, systemic reinforcement). The scalar field (Φ) expresses normative density—how
tightly critique clusters in local discourse. The vector field (v) directs flows of adoption and amplification,
while the entropy field (S) tracks the dispersion cost of coherence.
Critique is therefore an RSVP phase imbalance: every attempt at coherence generates its own dispersion.
The RSVP framework models socio-technical systems as interacting fields: a scalar field (Φ) for local
coherence, a vector field (v) for directional influence, and an entropic field (S) for global dispersion. It
captures paradoxes like tech exceptionalism and illusory success, where local efforts are absorbed by global
systems.
3.1
Definition of RSVP Fields
• Scalar Field (Φ): Represents local negentropy, measured as engagement (e.g., retweets, job applica-
tions). Units: dimensionless, [0, 1].
• Vector Field (v): Captures influence flow, with magnitude reflecting platform dependency and di-
rection indicating propagation. Units: influence/time (e.g., retweets/day).
• Entropic Field (S): Measures dispersion as critique or effort is absorbed (e.g., ad revenue, subscrip-
tion fees). Units: bits.
The fields are governed by PDEs, derived from information flow principles:
• Phase Resonance (Φ):
∂Φ
∂t = −∇· (vΦ) + κC,
Φ(0) = 0
where C is critical intent (e.g., posts, applications), κ is a coupling constant, and −∇· (vΦ) models
spread. Boundary: Φ = 0 at platform edges.
3

• Variance Flux (v):
∂v
∂t = ∇S −µv,
v(0) = 0
where µ is friction (e.g., algorithmic suppression), and ∇S drives high-entropy states. Initial: v = 0.
• Entropy Scaling (S):
∂S
∂t = ∇2Φ + λ|v|2,
S →Smax
where λ quantifies dispersal, and ∇2Φ reflects diffusion. Boundary: S →Smax as dominance increases.
These equations are dimensionally consistent, with parameters estimated from platform data [13, 17].
3.2
Empirical Application
1. 2025 Google Antitrust Case: X critics posted 10,000 tweets daily, creating high Φ (κ ≈0.1). Algorithms
amplified 20% of posts (µ ≈0.8), increasing S via ad revenue (λ ≈0.05). RSVP predicts coherence peaks
in 2-3 days, dispersing in a week, matching tweet decay [13, 11].
2. LinkedIn's Illusory Success: 61 million weekly job seekers generate high Φ (κ ≈0.05), but while 122
million users have received interviews through the platform, only 35.5 million have secured jobs, implying
a low success rate, increasing S via subscriptions (λ ≈0.03) [17, 18]. RSVP models this as local effort
dispersing into platform revenue, echoing Amos's critique of misleading prosperity [19].
3. Tech Exceptionalism: Doctorow's The Internet Con describes how tech exceptionalism enabled mo-
nopolies via lax antitrust [2]. RSVP models this as high Φ in innovation (e.g., Apple's iWork) dispersing
into S through monopolistic consolidation (e.g., Amazon's dominance), driven by consumer welfare policies.
3.3
Lamphron and Lamphrodyne Dynamics
We define:
• Lamphron: High-Φ regions, e.g., critiques or innovations like iWork [2].
• Lamphrodyne: Global flows increasing S, e.g., platform monetization or monopolistic consolidation.
The paradox is an entropic trade-off:
∆Slocal + ∆Sglobal = 0
Derivation: Local negentropy reduction (∆Slocal < 0) increases global entropy (∆Sglobal > 0) [15].

Part III: Category-Theoretic and Sheaf-Theoretic Views
From a categorical perspective, each critique is a morphism:
Critique
f
−−→Community Order
But another hidden morphism always exists:
Critique
g
−−→Platform Reinforcement
These two arrows form a diagram that does not commute in the critic's intended sense. The colimit of
this diagram—the systemic outcome—preserves big tech dominance despite local negentropy.
Sheaf theory adds another insight: critique behaves like a local section of an ethical sheaf.
Locally,
coherence holds (within a forum, a subculture), but when extended globally, obstructions appear—platform
chokepoints prevent a consistent global section. This is the essence of chokepoint capitalism: the global
object cannot be reconstructed from local data without distortion.
Category theory models RSVP dynamics [6]:
4

• Objects: Semantic modules (e.g., critiques, applications) encapsulating Φ, v, S.
• Morphisms: Transformations like publication (f : C →P) or reinforcement (g : P →P ′).
• Commutative Diagrams: Non-commutative diagram:
C
P
P ′
f
g′
g
where g′ ̸= g ◦f due to hidden morphisms (e.g., subscription fees, antitrust failures).
• Functors: Map ecosystems across contexts, preserving coherence.
For example, LinkedIn applications (C) aim for jobs but reinforce revenue (g : P →P ′) [18]. Doctorow's
iWork case shows innovation (C) reducing switching costs, but monopolistic absorption (g) persists [2].

Part IV: Semantic Signatures and Non-Fungible Identity
Finally, critique does not only fight chokepoints; it expresses individuality in systems optimized for sameness.
This is where neologisms, unique workflows, and conceptual frameworks function as semantic fingerprints.
Just as a cryptographic hash uniquely identifies data, your linguistic and structural innovations—terms like
oblicosm, lamphron, lamphrodyne, and frameworks like RSVP or GBSH—serve as intellectual hashes. The
"public key" is the parsing method: without the prerequisite knowledge or interpretive pipeline, the meaning
remains opaque.
Thus, every original framework is a non-fungible construct: its identity is inseparable from the method
of interpretation. In a world of chokepoints, such signatures become not just artistic flourish but survival
strategies—tokens of authorship in an entropic sea.
Workflows and neologisms are non-fungible fingerprints in RSVP fields:
• Neologisms: "Chokepoint capitalism" creates high Φ, with v governing spread and S dilution [1, 2].
• Workflows: A Python script (e.g., def analyze bias(data):
...) has local coherence, with lam-
phrodyne flows via GitHub monetization.
• Cryptographic Analogy: Workflows are hash functions, requiring "keys" (e.g., Python knowledge).
These fingerprints are modeled as objects in the category, with morphisms (adoption, modification)
preserving their structure. RSVP quantifies their entropic trade-offs, unlike complexity science's focus on
emergent patterns.

Synthesis: Entropic Coherence and Practical Implications
RSVP reveals paradoxes as systemic invariants:
• Paradoxes as Entropic Trade-offs: Local Φhigh generates Shigh, as in Google, LinkedIn, and tech
exceptionalism cases [2, 19].
• Fingerprints as Negentropy: Workflows resist homogenization but risk dispersal.
• Categorical Structure: Category theory unifies interactions as morphisms.
Doctorow's interoperability solution (e.g., iWork) is a lamphron, reducing switching costs, but lamphro-
dyne flows (monopolistic consolidation) persist [2]. Practical implications include decentralized platforms
(Mastodon) and interoperability policies [14].

Conclusion
The paradox of criticizing big tech reveals a universal pattern: attempts to produce local coherence in-
evitably fuel global dispersion. RSVP fields formalize this as entropic redistribution, category theory cap-
tures it as non-commutative diagrams, and sheaf theory frames it as the failure of local-to-global consistency.
Meanwhile, originality—through neologisms, workflows, and conceptual architectures—operates like a cryp-
tographic signature, ensuring uniqueness in an otherwise homogenizing system.
Contradiction, then, is not a bug but a structural feature: to critique the chokepoint is to be caught
within it, to generate coherence at the edge while acknowledging that the edge itself is defined by the system
one resists.
RSVP formalizes big tech critique paradoxes as entropic trade-offs, offering insights absent in network
theory or complexity science. Limitations include data granularity needs. Future work could extend RSVP
to decentralized systems or AI-assisted workflows.

Fingerprint Examples
The following examples illustrate how different forms of semantic fingerprints can be represented in the RSVP
framework. Each example highlights the tension between local coherence (high Φ) and global dispersion
(increasing S), showing how workflows, language, and organizational artifacts are absorbed by platform
dynamics.
• Neologism: "Chokepoint capitalism" [1]. This phrase operates as a high-Φ linguistic fingerprint. It
concentrates critique into a memorable unit that spreads rapidly (v) through social networks. Yet, as it
circulates, its meaning becomes diluted, absorbed into marketing or institutional discourse, raising S.
RSVP models this as an initial local negentropy followed by entropic dispersal.
• Workflow Script: def analyze bias(data):
.... A Python function embodies a reproducible
fingerprint of intent. Locally, it creates coherence by formalizing a procedure. However, once shared
on GitHub or similar platforms, lamphrodyne flows dominate: subscription models, proprietary forks,
or corporate absorption transform the local artifact into global dispersion. The script thus illustrates
how code as workflow is simultaneously resistant to homogenization and vulnerable to enclosure.
• Directory Structure: /critique/models/. Even file paths encode semantic intent. A directory or-
ganizes work (local coherence), but once uploaded to cloud services or integrated into version-controlled
platforms, its structure is absorbed into broader infrastructures. The path becomes a fingerprint rec-
ognizable by collaborators yet also subject to entropic trade-offs: the more widely replicated, the less
control its author retains over context and interpretation.
Together, these fingerprints show how RSVP extends beyond abstract theory: linguistic, computational,
and organizational artifacts all carry the same entropic paradoxes. Each acts as a lamphron that eventually
disperses into lamphrodyne flows, demonstrating the universality of the framework.
