From Gossip to Chokepoint Capitalism: Cycles of
Semantic Constraint
Flyxion
September 17, 2025
Abstract
This essay examines the persistent cultural and economic anxieties surround-
ing computational technologies, tracing their evolution from the 1950s discourse on
"automatic computers" to the contemporary reality of chokepoint capitalism. Early
texts, such as Ned Chapin's An Introduction to Automatic Computers [Chapin,
1963], emphasized the human labor behind machine outputs, countering the myth of
autonomous "giant brains." Films like Desk Set [des, 1957] and The Creation of the
Humanoids [hum, 1962] dramatized these tensions, portraying computers as tools,
threats, or judges of human identity.
Today, platform governance—exemplified
by opaque algorithmic bans—extends this lineage, granting machines not intelli-
gence but authority. Economically, generative infrastructures mirror containeriza-
tion more than the microprocessor, consolidating value into oligopolistic bottlenecks
[Neumann, 2025, Giblin and Doctorow, 2022]. The essay proposes a typology of
semantic infrastructures—gossip, religion, platforms, chokepoint capitalism—each
emerging as an entropy-smoothing mechanism that hardens into constraint. Using
the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework [Flyxion, 2025], it in-
troduces semantic infrastructures that metabolize contradictions, preserving scalar
density (Φ), vector flows (⃗v), and entropy (S). Through historical analysis, cultural
critique, and categorical formalism, the essay argues for designing systems that sta-
bilize meaning without collapsing into chokepoints, offering a path toward a fourth
stage of semantic infrastructure.
Introduction: From Black Boxes to Bottlenecks
Since the 1950s, computing has been shadowed by a recurring cultural anxiety: are ma-
chines black boxes that "think" or judge? Early textbooks, such as Ned Chapin's An
Introduction to Automatic Computers [Chapin, 1963], debunked the myth of autonomous
"giant brains," highlighting the extensive human labor required for data preparation and
programming. Yet popular imagination, fueled by speculative essays like Alan Turing's
[Turing, 1950] and films like Desk Set [des, 1957], framed computers as potential re-
placements for human expertise or arbiters of identity. Today, this anxiety is no longer
speculative but lived: an algorithmic Facebook ban, issued without explanation or appeal,
exemplifies machines exercising authority without comprehension.
Economically, a parallel cycle unfolds. The microprocessor sparked distributed experi-
mentation, birthing new industries [Perez, 2002], while containerization streamlined trade
1

but concentrated profits downstream [Neumann, 2025]. Generative systems today follow
the latter path, reinforcing oligopolies [Giblin and Doctorow, 2022]. This essay argues
that these dynamics reflect a broader cycle of semantic infrastructures—gossip, religion,
platforms, chokepoint capitalism—each emerging to stabilize meaning and ending as con-
straint. The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework [Flyxion, 2025] offers
a field-theoretic lens to redesign these systems, preserving scalar density (Φ), vector flows
(⃗v), and entropy (S) to metabolize contradictions rather than expel them.
The essay proceeds as follows: Sections 1-2 explore the 1950s discourse and cultural
imaginaries, grounding the cycle's historical roots. Sections 3-4 analyze platforms and
chokepoint capitalism as modern enclosures. Section 5 formalizes the cycle across gos-
sip, religion, platforms, and chokepoints. Section 6 introduces RSVP as an alternative,
followed by new sections: Section 7 proposes semantic infrastructures as a fourth stage,
Section 8 models conversations and artworks as context-trained bots, and Section 9 ap-
plies this to generative cinema. The conclusion synthesizes the argument, advocating for
infrastructures that keep meaning open.
1
The Early Frame (1950s Textbooks)
In the 1950s, "automatic computers" were both technical marvels and cultural enigmas.
Ned Chapin's An Introduction to Automatic Computers [Chapin, 1963] framed them as de-
terministic tools requiring meticulous human preprocessing—data collection, verification,
and coding—before producing even basic outputs. This countered the popular narrative,
exemplified by Edmund Berkeley's Giant Brains, or Machines That Think [Berkeley,
1949], which speculated that computers could mimic human reasoning. Alan Turing's
essays [Turing, 1950, 1956] nuanced this, proposing that indistinguishability in specific
tasks (e.g., chess) might suﬀice for "thinking." Professional texts, like Williams [1959]
and Gregory and Horn [1960], emphasized practical applications—accounting, inventory
management—over philosophical speculation.
This duality set a paradox: computers were over-ascribed intelligence before their scale
made such ascriptions consequential.
The scarcity of machines (a few hundred glob-
ally by 1955) kept debates abstract, but the tension—tools versus autonomous agents—
foreshadowed later enclosures. For example, IBM's early systems, like the 701, required
teams of operators, yet media portrayed them as self-suﬀicient "brains" [Edwards, 1996].
This misattribution fueled both optimism and anxiety, setting the stage for cultural nar-
ratives.
2
Cultural Imaginaries (1957-1962)
Popular media amplified these tensions.
Desk Set [des, 1957] portrays EMERAC, an
"electronic brain," threatening librarians' jobs but faltering on contextual queries, echoing
Chapin's warnings. The film's resolution—humans and machines as partners—reflects a
cautious optimism. Conversely, The Creation of the Humanoids [hum, 1962] imagines
robots claiming authority to define humanity in a post-apocalyptic world. These films
stage the same question—tool, partner, or judge?—but differ in scope: Desk Set fears
workplace redundancy, while Humanoids grapples with existential redefinition.
Other cultural artifacts reinforced this. Science fiction, like Asimov's I, Robot [Asimov,
2

1950], explored machine ethics, while newsreels hyped computers as oracles. These nar-
ratives metabolized ambiguity, keeping the debate open rather than resolving it, unlike
later platforms that enforce singular judgments.
3
Platforms as Enclosures
The shift from scarce institutional computers to ubiquitous platforms transformed am-
biguity into enclosure. Platforms promised frictionless connection but delivered opaque
governance. A Facebook ban, issued algorithmically without appeal, exemplifies this: a
machine without associative reasoning exercises judgment over identity [Gillespie, 2018].
This mirrors gossip's reputation traps and religion's dogma at scale: platforms compress
meaning (into metrics), codify flows (via feeds), and expel contradiction (as bans).
Zuboff [2019] describes this as surveillance capitalism, where user behavior is monetized
through opaque algorithms. For example, YouTube's recommendation system prioritizes
engagement, narrowing content diversity [Ribeiro et al., 2020]. This "Black Mirror bureau-
cracy" inverts Desk Set's optimism: machines are not fallible assistants but unaccountable
judges, operationalizing the fears of mid-century cinema.

Chokepoint Capitalism
Economically, platforms reflect chokepoint capitalism [Giblin and Doctorow, 2022]. Jerry
Neumann's containerization analogy [Neumann, 2025] contrasts the microprocessor's dis-
tributed innovation with containerization's consolidation. Generative systems, arriving
late in the ICT cycle, follow the latter: revolutionary but oligopolistic.
Startups de-
pend on proprietary APIs, unable to replicate the garage-to-giant path of early tech firms
[Perez, 2002].
For example, OpenAI's API pricing locks developers into dependency, while cloud plat-
forms like AWS control compute infrastructure. Consumers gain cheaper services, but
innovators face squeezed margins, mirroring containerization's downstream value capture
by firms like Walmart. This consolidation extends platform governance: just as bans
constrain speech, chokepoints limit economic agency, funneling value to incumbents.
5
Continuity of Constraint Cycles
The cycle of semantic infrastructures—gossip, religion, platforms, chokepoint capitalism—
reveals a pattern:
• Gossip: Stabilizes trust via narratives but ossifies into reputation traps, e.g., os-
tracism in tribal societies [Dunbar, 1996].
• Religion: Codifies meaning across generations but hardens into dogma, e.g., me-
dieval Church indulgences [Huizinga, 1919].
• Platforms: Enable global communication but collapse into opaque feeds, e.g., Twit-
ter's algorithmic curation [Gillespie, 2018].
• Chokepoint capitalism: Delivers eﬀiciency but concentrates value, e.g., Amazon's
marketplace dominance [Giblin and Doctorow, 2022].
3

Each begins as negentropic, reducing uncertainty, but ends as constraint, suppressing con-
tradiction [Schumpeter, 1942]. This cycle explains why early computing debates persist:
the question of machine agency is less about intelligence than infrastructural capture.
6
RSVP and Semantic Infrastructures
The RSVP framework [Flyxion, 2025] models semantic systems as fields:
• Scalar density (Φ): Semantic coherence, e.g., shared norms.
• Vector flow (⃗v): Information transport, e.g., conversational cues.
• Entropy (S): Contradictions driving generativity, e.g., debates.
Platforms expel S as noise, compressing Φ into metrics and bottling ⃗v in feeds. RSVP
proposes semantic infrastructures that metabolize S via:
• Recursive accountability: Judgments carry audit trails, e.g., transparent mod-
eration logs.
• Ephemeralization: Authority decays, requiring revalidation, e.g., time-limited
bans.
• Semantic watermarking: Metadata tracks transformations, e.g., provenance in
generative outputs.
• Entropy-aware merging: Contradictions are composed, not collapsed, e.g., pre-
serving divergent narratives.
Formally, meaning is a presheaf F : Xop →Set, with global sections via homotopy
colimits:
F(U) ≃hocolim
(∏
i
F(Ui) ⇒
∏
i<j
F(Uij) →
→
∏
i<j<k
F(Uijk) · · ·
)
.
Contradictions persist as cohomology classes, fueling generativity [Lurie, 2009].

Semantic Infrastructure Beyond Chokepoints
Semantic infrastructures aim for a fourth stage, metabolizing capture. Gossip could pre-
serve conflicting narratives via appeal mechanisms; religion could decay dogmatic author-
ity; platforms could embed transparent moderation; generative systems could mandate
interoperability [Doctorow, 2023].
For example, a decentralized social network could use blockchain-based audit trails to
make bans reversible, preserving S. In AI, open-weight models like LLaMA [Touvron
et al., 2023] contrast with closed APIs, enabling distributed experimentation. Categori-
cally, semantic infrastructures use homotopy colimits to preserve obstructions, ensuring
Φ remains dense, ⃗v distributed, and S metabolized, unlike chokepoints' rigid gluing.

Conversations and Artworks as Context-Trained
Bots
Every conversation or artwork is a bot trained on its context. A conversation is a functor
F : Cconv →M, mapping dialogue corpora to generative models, with utterances as
samples. An artwork is an endomorphism a : M →M, recombining a model's weights.
For example, Shakespeare's plays remix Elizabethan tropes, while a tweet threads prior
posts [Shakespeare, 1623].
Chokepoint infrastructures suppress obstructions, producing rigid outputs (e.g., Netflix's
formulaic recommendations). Semantic infrastructures preserve them, enabling generative
depth. Formally, contradictions are non-trivial cohomology classes in F's Čech complex,
ensuring conversations and artworks remain dynamic [Lurie, 2009].
9
Generative Cinema as a Case Study
Generative cinema illustrates this contrast. A system optimizing:
E = wc · continuity + wf · framing error + wm · motion jerk −wr · relevance gain
can recombine tropes (e.g., noir, comedy) via trajectory optimization [?]. In semantic in-
frastructures, contradictions (e.g., montage vs. continuity) fuel creativity; in chokepoints,
they collapse into market-tested templates. Shakespeare's variant quartos preserve ambi-
guity [Shakespeare, 1623], while Netflix's algorithms reduce films to engagement metrics,
echoing platform enclosures.

Conclusion: Keeping the Plenum Open
The question—can machines think, judge, or profit?—persists from 1950s textbooks to
2025 platforms. What has changed is dependence: from rare machines to total infrastruc-
tures. Gossip, religion, platforms, and chokepoint capitalism each stabilize meaning but
harden into constraints. RSVP offers a design grammar to break this cycle, metaboliz-
ing S to keep Φ and ⃗v open. Without such redesigns, every technological wave repeats
capture. With them, we can build systems that preserve meaning's generative depth.

A
Mathematical Formalism
A.1
Categories of Context and Generation
Let C denote the category of contexts:
• Objects: corpora U (dialogue histories, artistic traditions, datasets).
• Morphisms f : U →V: inclusions or transformations (e.g., genre shifts).
Let M denote the category of generative models:
5

• Objects: models trained on corpora.
• Morphisms: fine-tunings or transfer functors.
A conversation is a functor F : Cconv →Mutterances, with utterances as samples from
F(U). An artwork is an endomorphism a : M →M, reconfiguring model weights. An
oeuvre is a subcategory O ⊆M closed under such endomorphisms.
A.2
Sheaf-Theoretic Encoding
Let (X, τ) be a site of contexts. A presheaf F : Xop →Set assigns generative acts to each
open set U. Stages:
• Gossip: Presheaf with non-unique gluing (contradictory overlaps).
• Religion: Sheafification enforces unique extensions (dogma).
• Platforms: Algorithmic sheaves hide provenance (e.g., recommendation engines).
• Semantic infrastructure: Derived stacks with homotopy colimits, preserving ob-
structions as cohomology classes.
Global sections are:
F(U) ≃hocolim
(∏
i
F(Ui) ⇒
∏
i<j
F(Uij) →
→
∏
i<j<k
F(Uijk) · · ·
)
.
A.3
RSVP Field Mapping
Generative acts are fields:
• Scalar density (Φ): Semantic weight, e.g., norm density.
• Vector flow (⃗v): Transport of tropes, e.g., conversational flows.
• Entropy (S): Contradictions, measured as cohomology classes.
Semantic infrastructures preserve S; chokepoints expel it (S →0).
A.4
Theorem and Corollary
Theorem. Every conversation and artwork is a functorial generative model trained on
its context.
Proof Sketch. Construct C and M. Conversations are functors F : C →M, artworks
are endomorphisms in M. Generativity follows functoriality.
□
Corollary. Suppressing obstructions degenerates conversations/artworks into chokepoint
bots.
Justification. Rigid sheaves erase cohomology, compressing Φ, bottling ⃗v, expelling S.
A.5
Energy Functional for Generative Cinema
For a trope-selected shot with camera trajectory p(t) and look-at l(t), the cost functional
is:
E[p, l] = wcC(p, l) + wfF(p, l) + wmM(p) −wrR(p, l),
6

where C is continuity cost, F is framing error, M is motion jerk, and R is trope relevance.
Minimizing E yields cinematic coherence.
A.6
General Constraint Cycle
Infrastructures are functors G : C →M. Dynamics depend on:
• Metabolizing: H∗(F) preserved.
• Chokepoint: H∗(F) →0.
B
Notation
• Φ: Scalar density (semantic load).
• ⃗v: Vector flow (reference transport).
• S: Entropy (contradictions).
• C: Contexts.
• M: Generative models.
• F: Conversation functor.
• a : M →M: Artwork endomorphism.
• hocolim: Homotopy colimit.
• H∗(F): Obstruction cohomology.
• p(t), l(t): Camera functions.
• E[p, l]: Cinema energy functional.
C
Example: From Gossip to Derived Sheaves
For a site (X, τ), a presheaf F : Xop →Set assigns claims to contexts U.
Gossip: F(U) is narratives; overlaps Uij disagree up to ∼.
Religion: Sheafification forces agreement, losing ambiguity.
Platforms: Algorithmic sheaves select one section, hiding provenance.
Semantic Infrastructure: Derived stacks with:
F(U) ≃hocolim
(∏
i
F(Ui) ⇒
∏
i<j
F(Uij) →
→
∏
i<j<k
F(Uijk) · · ·
)
.
Obstructions in Hk( ˇC({Ui}, π∗F)) are appeal handles.

Generative Cinema: Shakespeare vs. Netflix
A generative movie bot uses:
Ak(t) = αU(t) + βCk(t) + γ
∑
s
ws,tAk−1(s) −δR(t) −ηIk(t).

speare, 1623].
