Setting
A lavish court, 1668. Candlelight glints oﬀgoblets and powdered wigs. A throne looms center stage, surrounded by
nobles whispering and snickering. A massive scroll, Wilkins Universal Language, awaits its doomed debut.
Act I: The Folly Unveiled
[Curtain rises. WILKINS struts in, robes billowing, clutching a scroll that looks like a librarians fever dream. The
COURT murmurs, expecting a telescope or a poem. KING CHARLES II slouches on his throne, bored but curious.]
WILKINS: (booming) Behold, Your Majesty! The Universal Language! A code to banish Babel, unite mankind,
and catalog creations soul! (unfurls scroll with a ﬂourish)
[The scroll is a chaotic grid of glyphspart alphabet, part demonic doodle. NOBLES lean forward, then recoil.]
LADY MARGARET: (whispering) Is he summoning a demon?
JESTER: (aside) Or a headache.
WILKINS: (pointing to a squiggle) Zita! Beast, Rapacious, Dog. Zeto! Beast, Rapacious, Wolf. Clarity incarnate!
[DUKE OF YORK coughs violently. PAGE BOY yawns, slumping against a tapestry.]
KING: (dryly) And how does one say king in this tongue?
WILKINS: (ﬂipping through scroll, sweating) Ah! Zi for Person, Gad for Great Zigad! (beams)
[The COURT gasps. A goblet clatters.]
JESTER: (muttering) Sounds like a spice rack.
BISHOP: (clutching rosary) Heresy! He names our lord a condiment!
WILKINS: (oblivious) Behold the genera! Forty categories to cage reality! Elements! Beasts! Vices! (points to
Zil) Deceit!
[BISHOP crosses himself. LADY MARGARET rolls her eyes.]
LADY MARGARET: (to DUKE) Hes cataloged his own madness.

WILKINS: (ramping up) De for Element, Deb for Fire, Debo for Flame! Saln for Gunpowder! A merchant in
Peking, a shepherd in somewhere pastoraltheyll trade badgers with precision!
KING: (ﬂatly) My last badger was a regrettable hunt. Continue.
[PAGE BOY snores softly. DUKE nudges him awake.]
WILKINS: (desperate) A demonstration! (hands cheat sheet to ADVISOR) Good sir, say The dog runs!
ADVISOR: (squinting, trembling) Zita mov eta?
WILKINS: (clapping) Perfect! The world shall know the dogs haste!
KING: (deadpan) My hounds run faster than your language.
[COURT snickers. JESTER mimes a dog outpacing a scroll.]
LADY MARGARET: (loudly) Enough! This is a labyrinth, not a language. My maid speaks clearer with a
broom.
WILKINS: (bowing, clutching scroll) Your Majesty, this is but the seed of unity!
KING: (smiling thinly) A seed best planted elsewhere. (takes scroll, eyes ﬁreplace)
[WILKINS exits, dreaming of Zita. COURT erupts in whispers of mad philosophers and cursed runes. Curtain falls.]
Epilogue
Years later, a clerk ﬁnds the scroll in a dusty archive, labeled Wilkins Folly. He reads Zeto, quits, and becomes a
baker. The Universal Language, meant to conquer Babel, conquered only the kings patience.
