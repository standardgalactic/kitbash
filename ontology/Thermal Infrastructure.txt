Abstract
This academic essay articulates a unified framework integrating semantic infras-
tructure theory, polycomputation, and bioeconomic thermoregulation to reconceptu-
alize computation as a foundational infrastructure.
Computation is posited as an
entropic process, with thermal byproducts repurposed for environmental regulation,
while semantic infrastructure, formalized through fibered symmetric monoidal cate-
gories, enables coherent allocation and validation of useful computational work across
domains. Drawing on Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) field theory, the Cog-
nitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization (CLIO) module, and thermodynamic principles,
we critique inefficient entropy generation practices, such as speculative cryptocurrency
mining, and propose sustainable alternatives, including GPU-based heating systems
and cymatic yogurt computers. Policy prescriptions advocate for bans on non-useful
proof-of-work systems and mandates for Public Research Objects (PROs) to ensure
epistemic value.
The framework extends to post-terrestrial contexts, such as lunar
habitats, where computational and survival imperatives converge. A comprehensive
mathematical appendix provides categorical and physical formalisms, with expanded
proofs and visualizations via string diagrams. Case studies and simulations validate
the framework's feasibility, demonstrating its potential to transform computational
paradigms into sustainable, knowledge-enhancing infrastructures.

Introduction
Infrastructure transcends physical constructs such as transportation networks, energy grids,
or architectural frameworks, encompassing the orchestration of fundamental flows—energy,
matter, information, and entropy—that underpin societal and ecological resilience [7]. Twentieth-
century infrastructures assumed informational scarcity, energetic abundance, and climatic
stability, assumptions now invalidated by contemporary realities.
The computational sector, once an intangible overlay, is now a dominant thermodynamic
entity.
Data centers rival heavy industries in energy consumption, artificial intelligence
models demand megawatt-scale resources, and cryptocurrency mining surpasses traditional
manufacturing in energy intensity in certain regions [13, 8].
Yet, these operations often
1

exhibit thermodynamic inefficiency, consuming vast energy, dissipating heat as waste, and
producing informational outputs of variable societal value [9].
This essay proposes that computation is infrastructure itself. Each bitwise operation
is a thermodynamic event, each algorithm a heat source, and each dataset a mechanism
for entropy governance, forming a semantic-thermodynamic continuum where entropy is the
foundational substrate.
The dual thesis is:
1. Computation as an Entropic Process: Heat from computation can be harnessed
for environmental thermoregulation, transforming losses into assets.
2. Semantic Infrastructure: Categorical constructs enable allocation, merging, and
validation of useful computation across domains, ensuring epistemic value.
We critique wasteful entropy production, such as blockchain-based cryptocurrency min-
ing, and advocate for computation-for-heat systems, integrating Relativistic Scalar Vector
Plenum (RSVP) field theory, the Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization (CLIO), and poly-
computational agency [6, 19, 1]. Applications span terrestrial and post-terrestrial contexts,
with policy prescriptions aligning with bioeconomic imperatives.
The essay is structured as follows: Section 2 establishes categorical foundations. Section
3 details CLIO and polycomputational agency. Section 4 explores bioeconomic thermoreg-
ulation. Section 5 proposes a normative architecture. Section 6 integrates RSVP theory.
Section 7 presents case studies. Section 8 concludes with implications for post-Earth civi-
lizations.

Categorical Foundations for Semantic Infrastructure
Semantic infrastructure employs fibered symmetric monoidal categories for computational
objects across theoretical domains [2, 10]. Semantic modules—encapsulated computational
entities—and entropy-respecting morphisms ensure informational coherence.
A semantic module is a quadruple M = (F, Σ, D, φ):
- F: Finite set of function hashes identifying operations. - Σ: Semantic type annotations
for consistency.
- D: Directed acyclic dependency graph of submodules.
- φ: Entropy
mapping to RSVP observables.
Morphisms f : M →M ′ preserve entropy and typing:
∀µ ∈M,
S(f(µ)) ≤S(µ),
Σ(µ) ⊆Σ(f(µ)).
The category Sem is fibered over Dom (e.g., RSVP cosmology, AI alignment). The
projection functor π : Sem →Dom assigns modules to domains, with fibers π−1(D). The
symmetric monoidal tensor product is:
M1 ⊗M2 = (F1 ⊎F2, Σ1 ∪Σ2, D1 ⊔D2, φ1 ⊎φ2).
Semantic merging uses homotopy colimits [11, 17]:
Merge({Mi}) = hocolimi∈IMi,
2

S(Merge({Mi})) ≤sup
i∈I
S(Mi).
RSVP maps modules to field triples (Φ,⃗v, S) (scalar semantic density, computational flow,
entropy flux), enabling semantic entropy quantification. Polycomputation integrates sym-
bolic, sub-symbolic, and field-based paradigms [1], reducing redundant entropy via fibered
translations.

CLIO Module and Polycomputational Agency
The Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization (CLIO) enables self-adaptive reasoning in
large language models, allowing problem formulation, uncertainty-driven adaptation, and
steerable scientific discovery [6]. As a recursive inference functor in Sem:
CLIO : Sem →Sem,
C(M) =
Z
X
κ(ΦM(x),⃗vM(x), SM(x)) dµ(x),
with κ aligning fields to objectives. Iteration is:
Mt+1 = Merge({Optimizeℓ(Mt)}ℓ∈L).
Polycomputational agency coordinates modules (e.g., physics constant extraction, com-
pression) via merges. For example, CLIO allocates climate anomaly detection tasks across
sensor networks, regulating habitat heat.
Its open design allows uncertainty monitoring
and corrections [6]. A 2-categorical enrichment supports hybrid reasoning across symbolic,
neural, and field-based methods.

Bioeconomic Thermoregulation
4.1
Terrestrial Contexts
Bioeconomic thermoregulation replaces heaters with compute clusters (GPUs, TPUs, cy-
matic yogurt computers) [3, 18]. Waste heat thermoregulates buildings, supporting compu-
tations like compression, LIDAR classification, environmental simulations, and quine gener-
ation [21]. This aligns with ecological sustainability [4, 12].
4.2
Post-Terrestrial Contexts
Blockchain-mining heaters are inefficient [16, 14, 8]. Lunar heater-computers focus on envi-
ronmental simulations, regolith analysis, and archival error-checking, funded via PROs and
cooperative networks [5, 20, 15].

Normative Architecture of Useful Computation
The architecture bans speculative proof-of-work, mandating Useful Compute Mandates.
PROs encapsulate semantic deltas, thermal logs, and proofs. Incentives tie computation
to scientific value [7]. The PoUWH protocol requires:
- PoH: Thermal output matches needs. - PoM: Semantic uncertainty reduction.
Transactions Tx = (Min, (τ, σ), Mout) satisfy:
Hthermo · Hsemantic ≥ηmin,
σ |= HomotopyColimitConsistency.

Integration with RSVP Theory
RSVP maps infrastructure to (Φ,⃗v, S) [19]:
∂S
∂t + ∇· (⃗vS) = σcomp −σloss.
