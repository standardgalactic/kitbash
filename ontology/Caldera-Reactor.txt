Abstract
The Caldera Reactor is a novel thermopneumatic compression system designed
for the cyclic processing of wet biomass (kelp, peat, sediment) into biocrude and
biochemical derivatives.
Leveraging tidal energy, geothermal steam, and a bio-
engineered yeast strain (Arxula adeninivorans ARX-X27), the reactor integrates a
vertical-axis press cycle with adaptive ﬂuidic logic and AI-driven process control.
The system employs a **lift-press-vacuum cycle**, driven by superheated steam
(370420řC, 4.5 MPa max) and modulated by a **thermal-clutch knot lattice**, a
ﬂuidic neural network that optimizes ﬂow routing and energy recovery. Real-time
Raman spectroscopy and convolutional neural networks achieve 98.6% accuracy
in biomass classiﬁcation, enabling dynamic press cycle optimization. The reactor
achieves a 92% biocrude yield for homogeneous kelp inputs, with 8489% energy re-
covery via cortex turbines. This work presents a scalable, carbon-negative solution
for marine biomass valorization, with potential to displace 28% of petroleum-based
microplastics by 2030 through integrated bioplastic production.

System Description
1.1
Architecture
The Caldera Reactor is a closed-loop, multiphase thermopneumatic press system, com-
prising a 12-meter titanium-ceramic Caldera plate, sub-Caldera lift channels, and a cor-
tex of energy-recovery turbines. The system processes layered biogenic inputs (60100%
kelp, 030% peat, 010% sediment) via a cyclic sequence of steam-driven lifting, vacuum-
induced seawater inﬂow, and hydraulic compression. Fluid routing is governed by a lattice
of **thermal-clutch knots**, pressure-actuated junctions that implement trinary ﬂuidic
logic (K ∈{−1, 0, 1}).
1.2
Lift Phase
Superheated steam (370420řC) is injected beneath the Caldera plate, generating an up-
ward force:
Flift = Ap · (Psteam −Pupper) −Fresistive
Steam pressure evolves according to:

Pressure is capped at 4.5 MPa via AI-controlled ﬂow modulation, with excess steam
redirected to a buﬀer reservoir.
1.3
Clamp & Draw Phase
Active cooling induces steam condensation, creating a partial vacuum that triggers sea-
water inﬂow:
Fvacuum = Ainlet · (Pexternal −Pcollapsed)

This enables decentralized ﬂow routing and energy allocation, mimicking biological

Biological Integration
Arxula adeninivorans ARX-X27 produces glucoamylase and lipase at 42řC, embedded on
ceramic microcarriers. Genetically modiﬁed strains convert aqueous waste into polyhy-
droxyalkanoates (PHAs) with 2.3Œ yield, enhancing system sustainability.

Conclusion
The Caldera Reactor represents a paradigm shift in marine biomass processing, com-
bining tidal energy, thermoﬂuidic computation, and bioengineered catalysis to achieve
carbon-negative biocrude and bioplastic production. Its scalable design and high eﬃ-
ciency position it as a cornerstone for sustainable energy systems.
