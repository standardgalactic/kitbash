Encoding Shadows, Retrieving Structure: A Synthesis
of the ADAPTER Model and the RSVP Framework
Flyxion
Abstract
This paper proposes a theoretical synthesis between the ADAPTER (Analogical
Depth and Patterned Transfer Encoding Retrieval) model of analogical retrieval and
the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, a geometric ﬁeld theory
of cognition that models consciousness as evolving scalar, vector, and entropy ﬁelds.
By treating analogical retrieval as a thermodynamic and topological process medi-
ated by relational encoding, we argue that RSVP provides a dynamic substrate for
ADAPTER's conceptual insights. This integration oﬀers novel computational per-
spectives on category formation, structured memory access, emotional dynamics,
and educational transfer, while resolving tensions between surface and structural
similarity in analogical cognition.

Introduction: Beyond the Surface Bias
The ADAPTER model (Analogical Depth and Patterned Transfer Encoding Retrieval) [1]
reﬁnes the debate around analogical retrieval by emphasizing that retrieval cues depend
not merely on surface resemblance but on the depth of encoding, shaped by prior relational
categories.
This view breaks from models in which memory retrieval is shallow and
largely reactive, instead highlighting how conceptual structure actively guides encoding
and recall.
The RSVP theory oﬀers a complementary perspective: cognition is represented not sym-
bolically but geometrically, with scalar ﬁelds (Φ), vector ﬂows (v), and entropy gradients
(S) forming a continuous substrate for memory, perception, and reasoning. Within this
dynamic ﬁeld landscape, analogical retrieval corresponds to topological resonance be-
tween prior and current ﬁeld conﬁgurations.
Together, these models propose that memory retrieval, analogical reasoning, and emo-
tional dynamics are not passive searches through discrete representations but active align-
ments of structured, contextually prepared domains.

Categories as Fields:
RSVP and the Relational
Encoding Hypothesis
ADAPTERs core contribution is to link relational categories to deeper encoding, such that
structurally similar but superﬁcially dissimilar events become accessible for analogical
transfer. In RSVP terms, a relational category corresponds to a coherent conﬁguration
in scalar-vector-entropy space—a topological pattern that can re-emerge when similar
conditions are encountered.
Rather than encoding via isolated feature vectors (as in classic cognitive models), RSVP
imagines knowledge as embedded in ﬁeld structures that possess memory-like hysteresis,
meaning they retain form across perturbations. This naturally supports ADAPTERs
insight that encoding quality, not just retrieval mechanism, determines analogical success.
Just as ADAPTER distinguishes between entity-based and relation-based encodings,
RSVP distinguishes between low-dimensional ﬁeld states, which encode speciﬁc tokens or
entities, and high-dimensional attractor basins, which encode abstract relational templates—
precisely the structures ADAPTER associates with successful distant analogs.

Retrieval as Topological Alignment
In the ADAPTER model, the availability of relational categories enables the retrieval of
structurally similar cases that may diﬀer in surface details. RSVP interprets retrieval
as a relaxation process in a thermodynamic ﬁeld: the current ﬁeld conﬁguration seeks a
lower-energy alignment with known attractor patterns, modulated by entropy gradients
(S).
This corresponds to what ADAPTER calls "retrieval guided by deep cues": the plenum's
entropy dynamics bias it toward relational coherence over surface similarity. Retrieval
becomes a reconﬁguration of the plenum toward prior ﬁeld states that match structurally,
akin to reactivating a geometric memory.
This also predicts ADAPTERs ﬁnding that learners often retrieve close analogs more
easily (due to surface cues), unless abstract categories are available to support structural
retrieval—which, in RSVP, would be interpreted as requiring stronger attractor basins
(i.e., more stable relational templates).

Educational Transfer and Field Coherence
Both ADAPTER and RSVP shed light on the persistent educational challenge of knowl-
edge transfer—why students fail to apply known concepts in new settings. ADAPTER
2

argues that transfer depends on the availability of abstract relational categories at en-
coding. RSVP models this as the formation of high-coherence ﬁeld templates that can
propagate across contexts.
Encoding through a relational lens corresponds in RSVP to generating stable phase pat-
terns across the plenum, rather than isolated local gradients. Such phase-stable structures
are more likely to reactivate under novel input, facilitating retrieval and recomposition
in new problems.
Further, RSVP oﬀers metrics like ﬁeld coherence, thermodynamic complexity, and cou-
pling strength to quantify how well a concept has been abstracted—providing a possible
formalization of ADAPTERs developmental trajectory in analogical reasoning.
5
Developmental Trajectories and the Formation of
Attractors
ADAPTERs developmental model holds that early encodings are tied to context-speciﬁc
relational categories, which only later evolve into generalized relational schemas. RSVP
predicts the same: early cognitive development forms fragmented ﬁeld conﬁgurations
with weak global coherence. Through exposure and personally meaningful experiences,
these fragmentary states undergo recursive alignment and eventually form stable attractor
basins—metaphoric "thought forms" capable of guiding future ﬁeld evolution.
As relational categories deepen, RSVP dynamics shift from chaotic reactivity (entropy-
dominated transitions) to low-entropy, guided structure—enabling retrieval of distant
analogs, deeper insight, and spontaneous transfer.
This recursive coupling between category abstraction and analogical access reﬂects a self-
organizing cognitive thermodynamics, oﬀering a uniﬁed explanation for both RSVP and
ADAPTER phenomena.

Emotions as Control-State Dynamics in the RSVP-
ADAPTER Framework
This section connects the RSVP-ADAPTER synthesis to a control-theoretic conceptu-
alization of emotions, viewing them not as pneumatic pressures to be released (as in
cathartic or hydraulic metaphors) but as structured, context-sensitive perturbations in
cognitive planning and perception. Emotions are framed as responses to mismatches be-
tween expected and actual outcomes, aligning with Perceptual Control Theory (PCT)
and the ﬁeld dynamics of RSVP.

6.1
Emotion as Entropic Perturbation and Reconﬁguration
In the RSVP framework, emotions manifest as dynamic reconﬁgurations of the cognitive
plenum:
• The scalar ﬁeld Φ(x, t) represents motivational salience or goal pressure, encoding
the importance of speciﬁc cognitive states or outcomes.
• The vector ﬁeld v(x, t) reﬂects directional intention or executive inference, guiding
cognitive processes toward goal-directed actions.
• The entropy ﬁeld S(x, t) captures uncertainty, instability, or cognitive dissonance
arising from mismatches in expectations.
When an expected outcome fails (e.g., a plan is thwarted), the plenum undergoes:
• A sharp spike in entropy S(x, t) at the site of the mismatch, reﬂecting cognitive
dissonance.
• Turbulence or reversal in the vector ﬁeld v(x, t), indicating a conﬂict in intentional
ﬂow.
• A local collapse or inversion in Φ(x, t), where previously salient goals lose validity.
These shifts are distributed across the plenum, responsive to relational mismatches (e.g.,
failed plans or broken analogies), and do not represent pressure build-ups but rather
pattern reconﬁgurations. Thus, emotions are changes in the RSVP ﬁeld conﬁguration
triggered by relational failures.
6.2
Emotional Priming as Analogical Retrieval
In the ADAPTER model, emotional states arise from the retrieval of analogical struc-
tures. When a situation is categorized as "betrayal," a relational schema with a speciﬁc
emotional shape (e.g., anger) is retrieved. Reframing the situation as an "unexpected
opportunity" shifts the retrieved schema, altering the emotional dynamic.
This aligns with the view that emotions result from primed cognitive pathways:
• Encoding a situation as "disrespect" primes pathways that produce anger-like vector
ﬁelds, characterized by high entropy and conﬂicting ﬂows.
• Recategorizing it as a "misunderstanding" redirects the vector ﬁeld, reducing en-
tropy without requiring repression.
This process supports the idea that distraction from frustration involves rerouting pre-
dictive structures, modulating Φ and v to dissipate entropy through new relational align-
ments.

6.3
Catharsis vs. Control Theory
Cathartic metaphors misconstrue emotions as high-pressure zones requiring release, cor-
responding in RSVP to saturated Φ, rising S, and frozen v—an unstable equilibrium. In
contrast, a control-theoretic perspective (aligned with PCT and RSVP) views emotions
as discrepancies between expected and actual ﬁeld ﬂows:
• Emotions arise from misalignments in the plenum, not from accumulated energy.
• Resolution involves restoring ﬂow alignment through recategorization or redirection,
not venting.
This eliminates the need for suppression, emphasizing reconﬁguration of the cognitive
ﬁeld.
6.4
Field Learning: Emotions as Meta-Analogical Error Signals
ADAPTER suggests that analogical mismatches generate retrieval failures or category
errors, which in RSVP appear as entropy spikes and vector torsion. These are signals
to reconﬁgure the ﬁeld, not punishments or repressed energies. Emotions, therefore, are
reactions to model mismatches, structured by prior relational categories and analogical
templates.
Changing an emotional state involves re-encoding the situation—retrieving a diﬀerent
analogy. For example, reframing a failure as a learning opportunity shifts the retrieved
schema, reducing entropy and realigning vector ﬂows.

Implications for Cognitive Science and Artiﬁcial
Intelligence
This synthesis suggests that eﬀective analogical cognition, emotional regulation, and
learning depend on the internal ﬁeld geometry of conceptual space. Designing systems
(biological or artiﬁcial) that support distant analogical transfer and adaptive emotional
responses requires:
• Rich, structured input contexts (supporting entropy diﬀerentiation).
• Recursive comparison operations (to foster attractor formation).
• Multi-scale ﬁeld memory (to preserve structure beyond surface features).
• Dynamic reconﬁguration mechanisms (to handle emotional perturbations).
RSVP may serve as a substrate for analogical and emotional AI, while ADAPTER pro-
vides the control-theoretic account necessary for learning and reappraisal stages. To-
gether, they point toward hybrid cognitive systems where memory, analogy, emotion,
and concept formation emerge as ﬁeld phenomena.

Conclusion: Toward a Field Theory of Analogical
and Emotional Thought
Both ADAPTER and RSVP converge on the idea that analogical retrieval, emotional
dynamics, and ﬂexible cognition emerge from how we categorize and encode experience.
ADAPTER frames categorization as relational and structured; RSVP models it as geo-
metric and dynamic, with emotions as control-state perturbations.
The synthesis suggests that structurally based retrieval and adaptive emotional responses
are default states of a suﬃciently structured cognitive plenum. Failures of analogy or
emotional regulation arise from the entropy of encodings—from ﬁeld patterns too shallow
to echo or too rigid to adapt.

To climb the ladder of cognition is to deepen the relational forms we trace in memory
and emotion—to cast shadows that return as ﬂexible, context-sensitive guides.

Extensions and Reﬁnements of the ADAPTER-
RSVP Synthesis
This appendix addresses proposed extensions to the ADAPTER-RSVP synthesis, focus-
ing on mathematical reﬁnements, empirical predictions, emotional dynamics, and educa-
tional applications to enhance the frameworks utility.
A.1
Dynamics of Category Formation
Real-world learning and emotional development involve non-ergodic processes. Time-
dependent coupling coeﬃcients can model this:
α(t) =
αmax
1 + e−k(t−t0)
where α(t) governs relational encoding strength, t0 is a developmental milestone, and k
controls abstraction rate. Bifurcation analysis can identify criticality conditions for phase
transitions, reﬂecting the shift from context-speciﬁc to abstract categories, including those
underlying emotional responses.
A.2
Multiscale Retrieval
To capture hierarchical analogs, the retrieval kernel K(ΦT, Φi) can incorporate wavelet-
based similarity metrics:
K(ΦT, Φi) =
∑
ℓ
wℓ
∫
ψℓ(x)⟨ΦT(x), Φi(x)⟩dx
where ψℓ(x) are wavelet basis functions, and wℓare scale weights. Scale-dependent en-
tropy terms (Sℓ(x, t)) prioritize relational coherence, enhancing retrieval of distant analogs
and supporting emotional reappraisal across domains.
A.3
Empirical Linking
The synthesis predicts neural signatures testable via fMRI or EEG:
• Low-entropy relational encoding and emotional stability correlate with reduced vari-
ability in default mode network (DMN) activity.
7

• Successful transfer and reappraisal exhibit increased topological similarity between
task-evoked patterns, measurable via persistent homology.
Field variables map to neural observables:
• Φ: Mean synaptic potentials in prefrontal and parietal regions.
• v: Directional coherence in functional connectivity networks.
• S: BOLD signal entropy, modulated by neuromodulators like norepinephrine.
A.4
Mathematical Reﬁnements
A stochastic control formulation uniﬁes retrieval, learning, and emotional regulation:
E
[∫(
D[ΦT, Φ(t)] + λS(t) + ∥v(t)∥2)
dt
]
where D is ﬁeld divergence, λS(t) regularizes entropy, and ∥v(t)∥2 reﬂects cognitive ef-
fort. Persistent homology can quantify category and emotional coherence via persistence
diagrams. A neural ﬁeld model:
∂Φ
∂t = −D∇2Φ + f(Φ, v, S) + η(x, t)
maps dynamics to cortical processes, with D as a diﬀusion coeﬃcient and η as neural
noise.
A.5
Educational and Emotional Design Implications
The framework suggests interventions:
• Entropy-Reduction Scaﬀolds: Visualizations of ﬁeld gradients and repetition
with variational noise to strengthen attractors, supporting emotional regulation.
• Cross-Domain Alignment Tasks: Training the retrieval kernel via paired prob-
lems to enhance structural isomorphisms and reappraisal skills.
• Dynamic Assessment Metrics: Response time variability (S) and transfer ﬂex-
ibility (attractor basin width) as measures of conceptual and emotional coherence.
These extensions provide mathematical rigor, empirical testability, and actionable strate-
gies for cognition and emotional regulation.
