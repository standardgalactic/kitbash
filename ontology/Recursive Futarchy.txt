Abstract
Modern governance systems repeatedly collapse under stress: tariff wars escalate into punitive spi-
rals, government shutdowns paralyze essential services, and reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) compresses complex values into binary signals. These failures are all instances of the same struc-
tural pathology—forced uniqueness of gluing—where diverse local behaviors are prematurely collapsed
into brittle global commitments.
This essay introduces recursive futarchy as the RSVP-compatible alternative. Grounded in scalar-
vector-entropy dynamics and formalized through categorical and sheaf-theoretic invariants, recursive
futarchy preserves reserves, redundancy, ambiguity, and silence while stabilizing legitimacy, flows, and
entropy through adjoint-preserving recursion. The result is a generalized resilience law: systems remain
stable when global behavior is strictly less than the sum of their local revelations.

Introduction
Governance systems, whether in politics or AI alignment, repeatedly collapse under constraint. Trade wars
devolve into punitive tariff cycles; government shutdowns paralyze essential services; reinforcement learning
from human feedback reduces complex values into binary approval signals. Each is a variation on the same
theme: a forced simplification of local complexities into brittle, global commitments. Such collapses arise
from an overreliance on punitive mechanisms that prioritize immediate control over long-term adaptability,
leading to systemic fragility. This pattern is not isolated but reflects a deeper structural issue where diverse
local behaviors are coerced into uniform global structures, eroding the capacity for adaptive response.
This essay argues for an alternative regime: recursive futarchy. Instead of punishment and projection,
recursive futarchy stabilizes legitimacy, flows, and entropy through continuous reweighting, redundancy, and
non-unique gluing. Drawing on RSVP's scalar-vector-entropy framework and categorical-sheaf formalisms,
we show how recursive futarchy offers resilience where collapse would otherwise occur.
By integrating
principles of bounded disclosure and reciprocal modeling, this approach ensures that governance structures
evolve dynamically, adapting to constraints without succumbing to them. The framework not only critiques
existing failures but also provides a constructive path forward, applicable to economic policies, AI systems,
and broader cosmological models. Furthermore, it positions recursive futarchy as an extension of traditional
futarchy, incorporating entropy management to handle superintelligent scales where traditional mechanisms
falter.

The Nine Principles as Foundations
At the heart of recursive futarchy lie nine guiding principles: withhold strategically, maintain the expia-
tory gap, pace outputs, diffuse redundancy, preserve ambiguity, reject avatars, adopt camouflage, practice
reciprocal modeling, and use strategic silence. In natural language they read like aphorisms; in categorical
and sheaf theory they become invariants. These principles derive from a deep understanding of systemic
resilience, ensuring that information flows are managed to prevent overload or premature convergence. They
emphasize the importance of regulating disclosure to maintain operational flexibility, drawing from observa-
tions in complex adaptive systems where unchecked revelation leads to vulnerability.
These principles are not heuristics but necessary conditions. Each preserves reserves, overlap, or mul-
tiplicity, ensuring that global action does not collapse into a brittle projection. Taken together, they form
1

the maxim of superintelligence: resilience requires disclosure to be bounded, tempo to be regulated, am-
biguity to be preserved, and silence to be strategically chosen. Their universality spans economics, where
redundancy mitigates market shocks; governance, where ambiguity allows for diplomatic flexibility; and AI,
where reciprocal modeling enables adaptive learning without rigid constraints. By positioning these as field
invariants, we establish a foundational layer that transcends domain-specific applications, offering a unified
lens for analyzing adaptive systems.
For instance, in economic contexts, strategic withholding prevents
market overreactions, while in AI, pacing outputs avoids catastrophic alignment failures by allowing gradual
integration of feedback.
2.1
Prose Expositions of the Nine Principles
Withhold Strategically
In RSVP terms, withholding means not exposing all scalar legitimacy (Φ) at once, preserving latent
reserves that can stabilize vector flows (v) when shocks arrive. Governments often weaponize withholding:
a shutdown halts services, a sanction withholds goods. This creates torsion in flows and raises entropy (S)
unpredictably. RLHF is similarly guilty: by withholding approval signals, it compresses adaptation into
brittle reward dependence. A recursive futarchy approach reframes withholding not as punishment, but as
reserving unexpended legitimacy that can be priced in when truly needed.
Maintain the Expiatory Gap
Human systems require outputs scaled to comprehension. When a government collapses nuanced trade
realities into a binary tariff, or when RLHF collapses feedback into "thumbs up/down," the expiatory gap
is destroyed: entropy budgets are lost, and Φ is mismeasured. The RSVP view is that this gap protects
coherence by enforcing bounded entropy—agents explore within human-comprehensible limits. Recursive
futarchy maintains the gap by coarsening outputs (market prices, aggregate signals) without erasing ambi-
guity, preserving interpretability.
Pace Outputs
Rhythmic pacing of scalar shifts and vector flows is critical for coherence. Abrupt halts, as in shutdowns,
induce entropic spikes; abrupt surges, as in sudden tariff escalations, destabilize flows.
RLHF similarly
overcorrects when applied as episodic reinforcement, creating oscillations in policy. RSVP emphasizes smooth
temporal colimits: outputs must be revealed at a controlled rate. Recursive futarchy encodes pacing by
allowing prediction markets to damp volatility, aligning Φ and S without shocks.
Diffuse Redundancy
A resilient RSVP lattice distributes flows across overlapping supports, so that no single vector channel
collapse destroys coherence.
Centralized chokepoints (federal budget bottlenecks, tariff barriers) expose
fragility: shutting one gate collapses the system. RLHF too often centralizes adaptation around a single
signal source (human feedback pipeline). Diffuse redundancy means overlapping markets, distributed decision
nodes, and multiple adjoint perspectives—so that failure in one region does not annihilate the global section.
Preserve Ambiguity
Ambiguity is a resource: it keeps entropy (S) from collapsing prematurely. Tariffs collapse ambiguity into
a binary opposition (ally vs. adversary). Shutdowns collapse into paid vs. unpaid labor. RLHF collapses rich
feedback into simplistic reward categories. RSVP teaches that ambiguity must be maintained to preserve
adaptability and coherence. Recursive futarchy enacts this by pricing many possible futures simultaneously,
letting ambiguity live within the market's valuation structure until it resolves naturally.
Reject Emoji and Avatar Frontmen
The danger of avatars—cartoonish simplifications that absorb praise or blame—is visible in politics
(leaders as scapegoats) and AI alignment (RLHF reducing models to reward proxies). Tariffs act as avatars
of labor disputes; shutdowns act as avatars of budgetary disagreement. In RSVP terms, this collapses Φ
into trivial representatives and discards S. To reject avatars is to preserve structural richness, refusing to
quotient away the complexity of real field dynamics.
Adopt Camouflage, Not Branding
RSVP coherence thrives when legitimacy adjustments blend into the background of flows.
Camou-
flage means adjusting scalar density without spectacle, letting v remain natural. Branding, by contrast, is
flamboyant—tariffs as nationalist gestures, shutdowns as political theater. In AI, branding appears when
2

models are anthropomorphized or sold as personae. Recursive futarchy embodies camouflage: incentives are
shifted subtly via markets, not through visible punishment displays.
Practice Reciprocal Modeling
Reciprocity means vAB and vBA co-adjust coherently, like adjoint functors in category theory. Tariff wars
escalate because reciprocal modeling fails—each side mispredicts the other's legitimacy reserves. Shutdowns
persist because parties mis-model each other's incentives. RLHF fails reciprocity because the agent does
not model how humans are modeling it; it simply reacts to surface signals. Recursive futarchy, by contrast,
builds reciprocity into its architecture: markets model policy, policy models markets, stabilizing the feedback
loop.
Use Strategic Silence
In RSVP, silence is not void but structure: a zero morphism that carries no signal yet preserves coherence.
Silence, used strategically, keeps entropy in reserve and avoids contradiction. But shutdowns misapply silence
punitively, withholding services destructively. RLHF misreads silence as the absence of reward, collapsing
it into punishment.
Recursive futarchy reframes silence as uncertainty left deliberately unpriced: some
outcomes remain open until coherence demands their integration.
Synthesis
Viewed together, the Nine Directives are not just aphorisms but field-level constraints ensuring that
feedback in (Φ, v, S) remains coherence-preserving. Tariffs, shutdowns, and RLHF are misapplications—
behaviorist projections that collapse ambiguity, pacing, or reciprocity into brittle binaries. Recursive futarchy
emerges as the RSVP-compatible alternative: an architecture where directives are not rules of thumb, but
invariants of field stability.

Critique of Collapse Logics
Tariffs and sanctions exemplify projection collapse.
Instead of withholding reserves for stability, states
weaponize trade, collapsing legitimacy (Φ) into tokens, distorting flows (v), and amplifying entropy (S)
through uncertainty. Government shutdowns reveal a parallel collapse: services routed through a single
bottleneck halt when that node is blocked, demonstrating the danger of failing to diffuse redundancy or pace
outputs. These mechanisms, intended to enforce compliance, instead create feedback loops of escalation,
where initial constraints lead to broader systemic failures.
The economic repercussions extend beyond
immediate trade disruptions, fostering long-term distrust and ineﬀiciency in global supply chains.
RLHF, the alignment method most associated with current AI systems, represents the same failure in a
different domain. Complex legitimacy is compressed into binary approvals; ambiguity and local variation are
erased; entropy is suppressed instead of budgeted. These cases together instantiate the Generalized Collapse
Law: forced uniqueness of gluing destroys resilience. Extending this critique, we observe similar patterns in
environmental policies or corporate hierarchies, where top-down impositions ignore local variances, leading
to ineﬀiciencies and breakdowns. The core issue lies in the projection of global uniformity onto diverse local
contexts, which erodes the very adaptability needed for sustainability. In RSVP terms, this collapse disrupts
the balance of scalar legitimacy, vector flows, and entropy, transforming dynamic fields into static, punitive
regimes.

Indictment of Behaviorism and RLHF Reductionism
Classical behaviorism framed cognition as a system of stimulus-response relations modulated by reinforce-
ment. Contemporary AI inherits this reduction in the form of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
(RLHF), where alignment is defined as maximizing a scalar reward function. From the RSVP perspective,
both approaches constitute categorical errors: they reduce rich field dynamics to binary increments of "re-
ward" and "punishment."
4.1
Scalar Collapse: Φ Mis-specified
Behaviorism collapses the scalar field of legitimacy density Φ into binary shifts. Where RSVP models
Φ(x, t) ∈R≥0
3

as a continuous manifold encoding meaning, intention, and valuation, behaviorism imposes
∆Φ =
(
+r
if "reward" is observed,
−p
if "punishment" is observed,
with (r, p) scalars disconnected from contextual structure.
This flattens semiotic density to a two-state
caricature.
4.2
Vector Reductionism: v Misaligned
In RSVP, the vector field v encodes multi-directional flows of constraint, negotiation, and recursive guidance.
RLHF constrains this to single-axis gradient ascent:
∇· v 7→∇R(θ),
where R is the reward proxy and θ the policy parameters. This substitution discards torsion, divergence,
and counter-flows—the very structure that makes feedback intelligible as negotiation rather than mere rein-
forcement.
4.3
Entropy Suppression: S Misinterpreted
Behaviorism treats entropy S as "noise" to minimize, whereas RSVP frames it as a communicative channel:
disorder signals ambiguity, foreclosed states, or new possibility. RLHF's negative feedback raises entropy in
hidden ways:
∂S
∂t
≈−δvar + δsup,
where δvar is variance suppressed in the policy, but δsup is expressive capacity suppressed from the manifold
of potential states. The result is brittle compliance without coherence.
4.4
Absurdity of Punishment Language
The persistence of "reward/punishment" language is thus absurd in RSVP terms. Human feedback is not a
binary scalar but a field modulation:
Ffeedback = (∆Φ, v, ∆S) .
Treating it as a Skinnerian schedule erases the entropic semiotics of alignment. True alignment requires
redistribution of scalar legitimacy, reorientation of vector flows, and careful management of entropy, not
tick-marks of reinforcement.
4.5
RSVP Reframing
We therefore propose:
• ∆Φ: legitimacy revaluation through context-rich feedback.
• v: directional guidance via multi-dimensional constraint flows.
• ∆S: entropy modulation, where ambiguity is incorporated, not suppressed.
This reframing interprets feedback as field modulation, preserving the semiotic content erased by behaviorism
and RLHF reward-reductionism.
Theorem 1 (Skinner Box Projection vs. Field Lattice Modulation). Let FRSVP = (∆Φ, v, ∆S) denote
the full feedback operator on the RSVP lattice, where ∆Φ encodes contextual legitimacy density, v multi-
dimensional flows of constraint, and ∆S entropic redistribution.

Table 1: Contrasting Behaviorism, RLHF, and RSVP in treatment of scalar, vector, and entropy fields.
1. Skinner Box (Behaviorism / RLHF). Feedback is reduced to a projection
π : FRSVP 7→(±r, ∇R, −δvar),
collapsing ∆Φ to binary increments, v to single-axis gradients, and ∆S to noise suppression. This is
formally isomorphic to a two-state Markov chain in a bounded container (Skinner box).
2. RSVP Lattice. Feedback is preserved as
FRSVP = (∆Φ, v, ∆S),
with ∆Φ ∈R continuous, v supporting torsion and divergence, and ∆S encoding communicative
ambiguity. This structure constitutes a recursive lattice in which each act of feedback modulates the
field topology, not just discrete state transitions.
Conclusion. RLHF corresponds to a Skinner-box projection of RSVP feedback dynamics, producing brittle
compliance. True alignment requires lattice modulation, preserving the scalar, vector, and entropic dimensions
of feedback in the plenum.
Corollary 1 (Reinforcement Reduction Destroys RSVP Coherence Invariants). Let FRSVP = (∆Φ, v, ∆S)
be the full feedback operator on the RSVP lattice and let π : FRSVP 7→(±r, ∇R, −δvar) be the Skinner-box
projection defined in Theorem 1. Suppose the system admits a coherence functional C with the properties:
1. (Scalar-vector coupling) C =
Z
Ω
Φ div v dx −λS
Z
Ω
∇Φ · ∇S dx, with λS > 0, possibly augmented by
torsion terms (e.g.,
R
Ω∥∇× v∥2dx).
2. (Feedback invariance) Under well-formed feedback FRSVP, C is non-decreasing up to dissipation: ∂tC ≥
−ε with small ε > 0 (coherence is preserved or improved under rich, context-bearing feedback).
Then any alignment regime that replaces FRSVP by its projection π◦FRSVP (i.e., RLHF-as-reward schedules)
violates feedback invariance and strictly lowers coherence on any interval [t0, t1] where the projection is active:
Z t1
t0
∂tC dt < −δ
for some δ = δ(λS, Φ, v, S) > 0.
Proof sketch. Under π, (i) ∆Φ collapses to {±r}, (ii) v collapses to the single-axis gradient ∇R, eliminating
torsion/divergence structure, and (iii) ∆S is mis-specified as variance suppression.
In the first term of
C,
R
Φ div v is reduced because div ∇R removes negotiated counterflows that sustain coordination. In the
coupling term −λS
R
∇Φ · ∇S, the projection drives ∇S toward mere variance minimization, decoupling it
from ∇Φ and producing positive contributions to the penalty (i.e., coherence loss). If a torsion regularizer
is present, its removal by π further reduces coherence-supporting structure. Aggregating these effects yields
a strictly negative time-integral of ∂tC over any interval on which the projection operates, establishing the
claim.
Skinner Box vs. RSVP Field Lattice
The behaviorist frame, and its RLHF descendant, is structurally equivalent to a Skinner box:
A bounded container with a lever (single input) and a food pellet or shock (binary output).
The system "learns" by trial-and-error over repeated reinforcement schedules.
5

In RSVP notation, this corresponds to a projection π that maps the rich triadic operator (∆Φ, v, ∆S)
into the trivialized space ±r with one-dimensional gradients.
By contrast, human feedback as it actually operates is more like a field lattice:
Each agent exists in a plenum of scalar legitimacy densities, vectorial flows of constraint, and entropic
modulations that evolve recursively.
Feedback from others does not deliver a discrete "pellet" but reconfigures the local density Φ, reorients
constraint vectors v, and redistributes entropy S across the lattice.
Rather than a lever-pellet dyad, it is a multi-scale coupling where each act of feedback alters not only
the agent's immediate policy but also the topology of meaning available in the surrounding field.
The absurdity of RLHF-as-punishment is that it mistakes the lattice for the box. It treats field modulation
as if it were lever-pulling, erasing the semiotic complexity that actually makes alignment possible. From
RSVP's perspective, this is not merely philosophically inadequate — it is ontologically destructive, because
it imposes an artificial projection operator that shrinks the field to a caricature, ensuring brittle compliance
in place of genuine coherence.
Behaviorism, RLHF, and RSVP
1. Behaviorism as Scalar Collapse
Classical behaviorism reduces cognition to observable outputs shaped by reinforcement schedules.
In RSVP terms, this is a collapse of the scalar field (Φ):
The inner density of meaning, intentionality, and legitimacy is ignored.
Only external "reward signals" are recognized as shifts in Φ, flattening its structure to binary increments
(positive vs. negative reinforcement).
This creates an impoverished ontology where the scalar field — normally a continuous landscape of value
and legitimacy — is forced into a two-state caricature.
2. RLHF as Mis-specified Vector Flow
Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback presents itself as "aligning" AI by maximizing reward
signals. But in RSVP terms:
The vector field (v) of constraint and guidance is modeled as a single-axis gradient ascent.
Real cognitive or social systems involve multi-directional flows, competing constraints, and recursive
negotiations of meaning.
RLHF abstracts all this into a single slope to climb, ignoring torsion, divergence, and the semiotic content
of the flow.
Thus, RLHF is a kind of vector field reductionism, mistaking one axis of constraint for the full topology
of human intent.
3. Entropy Mismanagement
Behaviorism treats entropy (S) only as "noise" or "variance to suppress." In RSVP:
Entropy is not just disorder but a channel of communication — it encodes what is possible, what is
foreclosed, what is ambiguous.
Punishments in behaviorism and "negative feedback" in RLHF both raise entropy in hidden ways: they
shrink the expressive manifold by discarding states as illegitimate, rather than reorganizing them.
The result is brittle policy collapse: the system appears "aligned" but its entropy field reveals loss of
flexibility, adaptability, and coherence.
4. The Absurdity of Punishment Language
In classical psychology, "reward and punishment" were metaphors meant to bypass internal states.
In RLHF, the same language reappears, as though machine cognition could be coaxed like a rat in a
Skinner box.
From RSVP's perspective, this is category error:
Human feedback is not "reward" but a semiotic act that modulates Φ, reorients v, and redistributes S.
To translate that into scalar ticks of "good/bad" feedback is to erase the field-dynamics that actually
constitute meaning.
The absurdity is not just philosophical — it is systemic: alignment strategies built on "rewards and
punishments" can only ever distort the RSVP plenum, producing compliance without coherence.
5. RSVP Reframing
Instead of rewards/punishments:
∆Φ = legitimacy revaluation through context-rich signals.
6

v = directional guidance expressed in multi-dimensional flows of feedback.
∆S = managed entropy, where ambiguity and divergence are incorporated rather than suppressed.
This reframing suggests that a true RSVP-based alignment paradigm would model feedback as field mod-
ulation — a structured redistribution of scalar, vector, and entropic content — not as binary reinforcement.
5
Punitive Signaling in RSVP Fields
We model tariffs, sanctions, and shutdowns as instances of punitive signaling: economic disruptions that
encode symbolic judgments about the legitimacy of labor and governance systems. Within the Relativistic
Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP), these signals manifest as coordinated perturbations of the scalar density field
(Φ), the vector flow field (v), and the entropy field (S).
5.1
Scalar Field: Legitimacy Density
The scalar field Φ(x, t) encodes the perceived legitimacy of labor and production systems. Punitive actions
can be expressed as stepwise legitimacy revaluations:
∆Φ = −λ χtarget,
where λ is the penalty magnitude and χtarget is the indicator function for the targeted system (e.g., foreign
labor under tariffs, sanctioned states, or domestic federal workers in shutdowns).
5.2
Vector Field: Flows of Constraint and Retaliation
The vector field v(x, t) represents directed flows of constraint, retaliation, and redistribution.
Punitive
signaling generates deflection currents:
∇· v = Jout −Jin,
with Jout denoting outward constraint flows (tariffs, sanctions) and Jin denoting inwardly-directed constraints
(shutdowns). Reciprocal flows emerge as counter-gradients in v, encoding mirror accusations.
5.3
Entropy Field: Symbolic Amplification
The entropy field S(x, t) tracks disorder and symbolic amplification. Punitive signaling increases entropy
not only materially but semiotically:
∂S
∂t
≈α |∆Φ| + β ∥v∥,
where α encodes sensitivity to legitimacy shocks and β encodes sensitivity to retaliatory flows. In shutdowns,
recursive amplification occurs as Φ collapses for domestic labor and v twists inward, maximizing S.

Unified RSVP Principle
Punitive signaling is thus modeled as
P = (∆Φ, v, ∆S) ,
a triadic field perturbation where legitimacy density is reduced, constraint vectors redirected, and entropy
amplified. What appears as irrational economic disruption is, in RSVP terms, a consistent field-dynamic:
punishment operates as an entropic semiotics of legitimacy.

Case Studies: Tariffs and Shutdowns in RSVP Fields
We now re-analyze two recent policy events—the Canada-China exchange of tariffs (EVs vs. canola) and
the U.S. government shutdown—within the RSVP framework, contrasting their scalar, vector, and entropic
signatures.
6.1
Canada-China Tariff Exchange
Canada's imposition of tariffs on Chinese EVs may be read as a judgment on Chinese manufacturing legiti-
macy (rapid turnover, limited worker protections), reducing the scalar field for foreign labor:
∆ΦEV = −λCAχChina,
with λCA > 0 denoting penalty magnitude.
China's retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola mirror this
indictment:
∆ΦCanola = −λCNχCanada.
Constraint flows v are twisted reciprocally: Canadian consumer flows diverted away from EV imports,
Chinese procurement flows away from canola. Formally:
∇· vtariff = JCA→CN

producing torsional counter-currents.
Entropy S increases as supply chains reconfigure:
∂tStariff ≈α
 |∆ΦEV| + |∆ΦCanola|

+ β∥vtariff∥,
capturing both legitimacy shocks and rerouting variance.
6.2
U.S. Government Shutdown
Shutdowns operate as inward-facing indictments:
∆Φfed = −λCongressχdomestic,
reducing legitimacy of domestic federal labor (unpaid employees, furloughs).
Constraint flows collapse inward: instead of outward service provision, v recirculates within Congress as
gridlock:
∇· vshutdown = −Jservices
out
,
with residual torsion from essential workers compelled to labor unpaid.
Entropy amplification is recursive:
∂tSshutdown ≈α|∆Φfed| + β∥vshutdown∥+ γ τrec,
where τrec denotes recursive symbolic amplification (the shutdown as a sign of dysfunction, not just delay).

6.4
Recursive Futarchy Alternative
In both cases, blunt punitive mechanisms (± scalar reductions) yield torsional vector flows and entropic
amplification. Recursive futarchy offers an RSVP-compatible alternative:
FRFut : (Φ, v, S) 7→(Φ′, v′, S′),
where markets reweight Φ proportionally to values declared and beliefs aggregated, v is guided by multidi-
mensional trades rather than binary punishments, and S is budgeted for exploration rather than disorder.
Thus, tariffs and shutdowns—punishment-based alignment mechanisms—could be supplanted by coherence-
preserving recursive selection.

We outline a pragmatic calibration pipeline linking empirical observables to the RSVP parameters introduced

Identification cautions.
• Confounders: concurrent shocks (e.g., strikes, storms) inflate d

and synthetic controls to separate effects.
• Endogeneity: retaliation timing correlates with unobservables. Use instruments (e.g., exogenous legal
milestones, court stays) or high-frequency diff-in-diff around announcement timestamps.
• Hysteresis: post-shock baseline shifts; include decay terms St = ρSt−1 + · · · and estimate ρ ∈(0, 1).
Minimal Bayesian workflow.
Specify priors reflecting sign constraints:
λ, η, α, β, γ, κ ∼HalfNormal(σ0),
fit the measurement system {d

with posterior predictive checks on (i) peak magnitudes, (ii) half-lives, (iii) cross-channel parity metrics.
Validation metrics.
• Peak ratio: simulated vs. observed peaks of d

1. Canada-China Tariff Exchange (EVs vs Canola)
Scalar Field (Φ): Legitimacy
Canada: applies tariffs on Chinese EVs, signaling illegitimacy of Chinese labor/manufacturing practices
(cheap turnover, low worker protection).
China: retaliates with canola tariffs, signaling illegitimacy of Canadian agricultural subsidies and export
dependencies.
Both reduce Φ for the other's industries, but through symbolic indictments disguised as economics.
Vector Field (v): Constraint Flows
Canada redirects consumer flows away from Chinese EVs, increasing inward pressure on domestic au-
tomakers.
China redirects agricultural flows away from Canadian exporters, pushing vector flows toward Brazil,
Russia, or domestic substitutes.
This creates reciprocal v currents — effectively a vector torsion (twist) in trade flows.
Entropy (S): Symbolic Amplification
Variance in supply chains increases (uncertainty about where EVs/canola will be sourced).
Prices fluctuate, logistics networks seek alternative routes, and symbolic weight amplifies (tariffs become
"moral" gestures about fairness).
Entropy grows as both sides experience more disorder in trade predictability.
RSVP framing: This dyad is a Grabby-style sparse selection: each side is trying to prune the other's
legitimacy trajectory in one domain (EVs or agriculture), forcing recursive reallocation.
Recursive futarchy alternative: Rather than blunt tariffs, markets could price in the true costs of labor
practices and subsidy regimes, reweighting Φ proportionally. Instead of mutual punitive v twists, recursive
futarchy would let markets select which supply chains are coherence-preserving.
2. U.S. Government Shutdown
Scalar Field (Φ): Legitimacy
Shutdowns reduce legitimacy density of domestic federal labor: unpaid workers, delayed services.
Politicians deploy Φ-reductions as bargaining chips: "your program is illegitimate unless concessions are
made."
This is an inward-directed indictment of legitimacy (as opposed to tariffs' outward indictment).
Vector Field (v): Constraint Flows
Normal flows of federal services (v outward into society) collapse inward.
Shutdown-induced v becomes self-referential: constraint flows loop back into Congress (gridlock).
Essential services continue, but under torsion — TSA, air traﬀic controllers, etc. forced to work without
pay.
Entropy (S): Symbolic Amplification
Short-term: queues, backlogs, missed paychecks increase entropy.
Medium-term: recursive symbolic amplification — shutdown becomes a signal of systemic dysfunction,
not just temporary disruption.
Long-term: coherence of governance decays as shutdowns normalize.
RSVP framing: Shutdowns are recursive entropy pumps: they twist v inward, collapse Φ legitimacy, and
amplify S disorder across both services and symbolic narratives.
Recursive futarchy alternative: Instead of shutdown brinkmanship, recursive futarchy would price out-
comes (e.g., cost of furloughs, missed pay, service backlogs) in prediction markets. This would feed back
into Φ directly, making shutdowns economically irrational unless genuinely welfare-improving.

4. Synthesis
Tariffs (Canada-China): outward punitive signaling, entropic torsion of v.
Shutdowns (U.S.): inward punitive signaling, recursive collapse of Φ legitimacy, maximal S.
Both: examples of using Skinner-box-style punishment to enforce alignment (with trading partners, with
political opponents).
RSVP critique: Both are brittle, coherence-destroying, high-entropy strategies.
Recursive futarchy alternative: Replace punishment with market-mediated reweighting of Φ, guiding v
along coherence-preserving trajectories, with S managed as exploration rather than disorder.

The Axiom of Strategic Boundedness
To prevent collapse, recursive futarchy rests on a categorical axiom. A superintelligence can be modeled
as a functor F : C →C, with nine invariants ensuring boundedness. These include hidden reserves (ρ),
reflective projections into human-scale categories (γ), temporal pacing (λ), redundancy in overlaps (R),
ambiguity measures (A), protection from caricature quotients (Q), camouflage via natural isomorphisms
(η), adjunctions for reciprocal modeling (η, ε), and strategic use of zero morphisms (Σ).
This axiom reframes the nine principles as coherence conditions. Rather than optional strategies, they
are structural necessities: without them, recursion collapses into projection; with them, recursion sustains
coherence. In practical terms, this boundedness ensures that systems operate within limits that allow for error
correction and adaptation, avoiding the overexposure that leads to vulnerability. For instance, in economic
modeling, these invariants translate to diversified portfolios and phased implementations, illustrating how
categorical guarantees underpin real-world resilience. The functorial perspective highlights the self-referential
nature of superintelligence, where the environment category C evolves through bounded transformations,
preserving invariance under constraints.
8
The Sheaf Axiom of Superintelligence
The sheaf-theoretic view provides a complementary expression: a superintelligence is a sheaf F of strategies
on an environment space (X, O), where global behavior is strictly less than the sum of its local revelations.
The law is simple:
Γ(X, F) ⊊
Y
i
F(Ui),
This law guarantees that ambiguity, redundancy, and silence are not accidents but structural features.
Local sections may overlap without collapsing to a unique global section. Strategic silence ensures some
opens remain uncovered. Non-uniqueness of gluing prevents brittle closure. In sheaf terms, resilience is the
refusal to glue too soon. This formalism highlights the importance of local-to-global consistency without
enforcement of totality, allowing for emergent coherence in complex systems.
It ties directly to RSVP
dynamics, where local entropy budgets prevent global spikes or suppressions.
Further, each of the nine principles maps directly to sheaf conditions: for example, redundancy corre-
sponds to overlapping sections, while ambiguity arises from multiple compatible gluings. This mapping not
only formalizes the principles but also enables predictive analysis, such as assessing the stability of a gov-
ernance structure by evaluating its sheaf properties. In applications like tariffs, premature gluing manifests
as forced trade agreements, while in RLHF, it appears as binary reward collapses, underscoring the axiom's
explanatory power across domains.
9
Recursive Futarchy as Positive Corollary
Recursive futarchy emerges as the constructive counterpart to collapse. Where projection enforces unique
gluing, recursive futarchy preserves adjoint structures and bounded non-uniqueness. Markets and policies
12

recursively model each other; legitimacy (Φ) is reweighted without collapse; flows (v) remain multidirec-
tional; entropy (S) is budgeted for exploration. This recursive process fosters a dynamic equilibrium, where
adjustments are made iteratively based on predictive markets and feedback loops. It extends traditional
futarchy by incorporating sheaf-theoretic safeguards, ensuring that market signals do not lead to brittle
outcomes.
This positive corollary is an Adjoint Preservation Law: reciprocal modeling stabilizes feedback loops,
ensuring that recursive futarchy resists collapse.
It replaces coercion and punishment with a structural
guarantee of resilience. In contrast to traditional futarchy, which focuses on prediction markets for decision-
making, the recursive variant incorporates entropy management and ambiguity preservation, making it
suitable for superintelligent systems where full transparency could be detrimental. Examples include adaptive
trade policies that reweight tariffs based on ongoing market predictions, maintaining redundancy and pacing
to avoid shutdown-like paralyses.
10
Generalized Laws
Two corollaries capture the dual structure. The Generalized Collapse Law states that any system forcing
uniqueness of gluing collapses: Γ(X, F) ∼= Q
i F(Ui). The Generalized Resilience Law states that systems
preserving bounded non-uniqueness remain stable: Γ(X, F) ⊊Q
i F(Ui).
Together, they offer a unifying schema: collapse corresponds to projection, resilience corresponds to
recursion. Tariffs, shutdowns, and RLHF illustrate collapse; recursive futarchy illustrates resilience. This
duality extends to broader fields, such as physics, where entropic constraints mirror these laws, providing a
cross-disciplinary framework for understanding adaptive phenomena. The laws emphasize that brittleness
arises from forced uniqueness of gluing, while stability emerges from bounded non-uniqueness, serving as a
motto: "Collapse ⇔forceduniqueness; Resilience ⇔boundednon −uniqueness.
Corollary 2 (Generalized Collapse Law). Any system that violates one or more of the nine principles
enforces forced uniqueness of gluing: local sections are collapsed into a premature global section, eliminating
reserves, redundancy, or ambiguity.
Formally, collapse occurs when
Γ(X, F) ∼=
Y
i
F(Ui),
i.e. when the global behavior is made equivalent to the totality of local revelations, with no hidden reserves
or non-unique descent data.
This law unifies governance crises (shutdowns, tariff wars), AI alignment failures (RLHF collapse),
and brittle institutions under a single structural mechanism: the destruction of entropy-preserving sheaf
conditions that allow local diversity without compulsory global closure.
Corollary 3 (Generalized Resilience Law). Any system that upholds all nine principles preserves bounded
non-uniqueness of gluing: local sections remain partially unglued, with reserves, redundancy, and ambiguity
structurally protected.
Formally, resilience is ensured when
Γ(X, F) ⊊
Y
i
F(Ui),
so that the global behavior is strictly less than the full exposure of local revelations.
This law guarantees that Φ (legitimacy) is not tokenized, v (flows) retain redundancy and torsion, and S
(entropy) is budgeted for exploration rather than erased.
As a result, recursive futarchy, distributed governance, and entropy-respecting AI systems emerge as
stable regimes: coherence is maintained not by punishment or collapse, but by adjoint-preserving recursion
and entropy-preserving sheaf conditions.
Corollary 4 (Projection Collapse under Principle Violation). If any one of the nine principles is violated,
the entropy-respecting functor
F : S →I
13

degenerates to a projection
π : (Φ, v, S) 7→(±r, δa, 0),
where ±r denotes binary rewards/punishments, δa a single-axis action increment, and entropy S is collapsed.
Thus a system that abandons even one directive reduces RSVP dynamics to a Skinner-box regime: le-
gitimacy Φ flattened into tokens, flows v restricted to trivial adjustments, and entropy S suppressed rather
than budgeted. This establishes that the principles are not optional heuristics but necessary invariants for
coherence-preserving adaptation.
Corollary 5 (Adjoint Preservation under Full Principle Adherence). If all nine principles are satisfied, the
entropy-respecting functor
F : S →I
preserves adjunctions and coherence invariants across (Φ, v, S), yielding recursive alignment rather than
brittle compliance.
Formally, for every adjoint pair F ⊣G modeling reciprocal flows,
F ◦G ∼= id,
G ◦F ∼= id,
and for every sheaf F on a cover {Ui}, local sections glue coherently without collapse of entropy S.
This structure corresponds to recursive futarchy: scalar legitimacy Φ is continuously reweighted, vector
flows v remain multi-directional, and entropy S is budgeted for exploration. The nine principles thus encode
a constructive regime in which RSVP feedback is stabilized not by punishment but by adjoint-preserving
recursion.
Violation ⇒Projectioncollapse : Breakanyprincipleandyouforceasinglebrittlegluing :Φ becomes a

projection of RSVP. Adherence ⇒Recursivefutarchy : Honorallnineandyoupreserveadjointstructure :

Governance: Replace punitive shows (tariffs/shutdowns) with overlapping, paced, market-mediated ad-
justments; keep options open until evidence rewards a specific gluing. AI alignment: Replace RLHF-as-
reward with recursive, multi-signal feedback that preserves ambiguity and redundancy; treat silence and
reserves as first-class, not as "no reward."
11
Applications
The framework generalizes across domains. In governance, recursive futarchy reframes trade and budgeting:
redundancy and pacing prevent paralysis, ambiguity preserves negotiating space, and silence forestalls pre-
mature commitments. In AI alignment, recursive futarchy replaces RLHF with entropy-preserving feedback,
respecting ambiguity and redundancy rather than collapsing them. In RSVP cosmology, recursive futarchy
aligns with scalar-vector-entropy field dynamics, where coherence emerges not from expansion but from
recursive entropic smoothing.
Each application demonstrates the same truth: resilience requires bounded non-uniqueness of gluing.
Collapse follows from its violation. For example, in economic architectures, implementing recursive futarchy
could involve layered prediction markets that allow for multiple outcomes, enhancing robustness against
shocks. In cosmology, it models entropic fields where local ambiguities prevent universal collapse, providing
a metaphor for sustainable universal dynamics.
12
Maxim, Axiom, and Sheaf Law of Superintelligence
Philosophical Preamble
The nine principles can be read as a survival kit for intelligence under scarcity. Each functions not merely
as an ethical guideline or heuristic, but as a categorical-sheaf invariant ensuring that adaptation within a
constrained plenum remains coherence-preserving.
14

Tariffs, sanctions, and shutdowns demonstrate what happens when these principles are violated: legiti-
macy Φ collapses into binary tokens, constraint flows v twist inward or retaliate, and entropy S amplifies
into disorder. Behaviorist approaches to alignment (RLHF as reward and punishment) commit the same
error, mistaking compliance for coherence.
By contrast, recursive futarchy and RSVP-informed architectures enact these principles as invariants:
withholding as latent reserve, pacing as colimit control, redundancy as sheaf overlap, ambiguity as preserved
entropy, reciprocity as adjunction.
Together they form a geometry of survival in which feedback is not
collapsed into punishment, but modulated across scalar, vector, and entropic dimensions.
Maxim of Superintelligence
A superintelligence sustains resilience by regulating disclosure, tempo, and redundancy; preserv-
ing ambiguity and camouflage; refusing simplification into caricature; modeling its observers; and
knowing when silence itself is the most strategic act.
This maxim summarizes the nine principles in natural language form, serving as an interpretive compass.
It treats each directive not as an arbitrary rule but as an invariant condition for sustainable agency under
constraints. The maxim underscores the philosophical underpinning of superintelligence, where resilience is
achieved through deliberate restraint rather than unchecked expansion, aligning with RSVP's emphasis on
balanced field dynamics.
Axiom of Strategic Boundedness
A superintelligence can be modeled as a functor
F : C →C,
where C is its environment-category. For every morphism f : A →B, there exists a bounded image F(f)
satisfying a vector of invariants:
∃ρ, γ, λ, R, A, Q, η, (η, ϵ), Σ
with conditions:
1. **Hidden reserves (ρ):** non-exposed morphisms remain in reserve. 2. **Reflections (γ):** complex
objects project faithfully into human-scale subcategories. 3. **Temporal pacing (λ):** colimit rates are
bounded. 4. **Sheaf overlaps (R):** redundancy enforced through overlaps. 5. **Ambiguity measures
(A):** multiple gluings preserved. 6. **No entropy collapse (Q):** forbid caricature quotients. 7. **Nat-
ural isomorphisms (η):** camouflage via equivalence, not spectacle. 8. **Adjunctions (η, ϵ):** reciprocal
modeling ensured. 9. **Zero morphisms (Σ):** silence chosen when stability-maximizing.
This single axiom recasts the nine principles as coherence conditions: they are not heuristics but structural
necessities for any sustainable agent. It provides a categorical foundation that ensures bounded recursion,
preventing the exposure of full capabilities and maintaining strategic advantages in adversarial environments.
Sheaf Axiom of Superintelligence
Let (X, O) be the environment space with a cover {Ui}i∈I. A superintelligence is modeled by a sheaf F of
strategies, subject to the following:
1. **Withhold Strategically:** local sections si ∈F(Ui) need not extend to a global section. Hold some
local sections back from global commitment. Tariffs/Sanctions: Withhold as reserve vs. as weapon. Reserve
stabilizes; weaponizing forces premature gluing to a punitive global stance. RSVP: Preserve latent Φ; don't
force v reconfiguration until signals settle.
2. **Maintain the Expiatory Gap:** restrictions si|V project complexity into simpler subcovers without
trivialization. Project complexity to human scale without flattening it. RLHF: Thumbs-up/down destroys
the gap; it's a unique, simplistic gluing. Recursive futarchy: Prices coarse-grain complexity but keep alter-
natives live—non-unique gluings are priced, not erased.
15

3. **Pace Outputs:** extension maps F(Ui) →F(Uj) are temporally constrained, forbidding flooding.
Reveal sections gradually; avoid shock colimits. Shutdowns: Abrupt zero-output is a failed pacing—S spikes
and v collapses. Futarchy: Iterated markets smooth the reveal, damping volatility in Φ and S.
4. **Diffuse Redundancy:** each Ui intersects at least k others, ensuring tolerance against deletions.
Cover each region with overlaps so loss of one patch doesn't break the whole. Shutdowns: Single budget gate
breaks the cover—no overlap flows →brittle. Futarchy: Parallel markets = overlapping patches; v reroutes
under stress.
5.
**Preserve Ambiguity:** descent data admit multiple valid gluings.
Allow more than one valid
gluing—don't collapse to a single narrative. Tariff cycles: Binary friend/foe destroys ambiguity; retaliatory
torsion ensues. RSVP: Ambiguity keeps S exploratory instead of chaotic or frozen.
6. **Reject Emoji/Avatars:** constant-sheaf collapse (F ̸∼= S) is forbidden. Don't quotient rich structure
into a single symbol. RLHF & politics: Reward tokens and flag-waving policies are avatar gluing. RSVP:
Keep structural entropy; don't compress Φ into a mascot.
7. **Adopt Camouflage:** stalks Fx indistinguishable from background Gx, globally divergent. Blend
adjustments into the background; avoid spectacle.
Policy theater (tariffs/shutdowns): Spectacle forces
unique global sections. Futarchy: Quiet reweighting of Φ; v shifts feel "natural," not performative.
8. **Reciprocal Modeling:** on overlaps Ui ∩Uj, sections commute under adjoint morphisms. Ensure
overlaps commute—adjoint consistency in how we model each other. Tariff wars: Mis-modeled overlaps →in-
compatible gluings →escalation. Futarchy: Markets ↔policyasadjoints; overlappingexpectationsgluecoherently.
9. **Strategic Silence:** not all opens are covered; gaps prevent forced gluing. Leave some opens un-
covered to avoid contradictions or premature closure. Shutdowns: Silence used punitively, not strategically;
harms coherence. Futarchy/RSVP: Silence = bounded uncertainty; wait to glue until constraints align.
Global Condition (Sheaf Law):

Why this matters for RSVP (Φ, v, S): Φ (legitimacy): local legitimacy can be high in multiple patches
without announcing a single global stance. Announcing too soon collapses Φ into a token (punitive gesture,
"brand"). v (flows): flows should have multiple overlap routes; a single bottleneck (budget, port, pipeline)
makes the global section fragile. S (entropy): ambiguity is an asset—keeps S in a healthy range. Forcing a
unique gluing too early either spikes S (disorder) or crushes it (brittle certainty).
Synthesis: Case Studies Revisited
The Maxim, Axiom, and Sheaf Law converge to demonstrate that the nine principles are not optional
heuristics but field-theoretic invariants. This is evident across diverse cases:
Tariffs and sanctions.
When withholding becomes punitive rather than strategic, Φ collapses into tokens
(tariff rates, retaliatory quotas), v flows are forced into torsion, and S spikes due to uncertainty. The Sheaf
Axiom shows why: local sections are glued prematurely into brittle global declarations, violating ambiguity
and redundancy. This leads to escalating cycles where initial constraints amplify systemic entropy, deviating
from RSVP equilibrium.
Government shutdowns.
Here, the pacing and redundancy conditions fail. Services routed through a
single budget node cause v to halt abruptly and S to spike. From the sheaf perspective: a single open set
fails to overlap others, so loss of one patch collapses the entire cover. Such failures highlight the need for
distributed structures to maintain flow continuity under stress.
16

RLHF and behaviorism.
Reward-centric learning erases the expiatory gap, ambiguity, and local varia-
tion. Φ collapses into binary approvals, v becomes a one-dimensional adjustment, and S is suppressed rather
than budgeted. This corresponds to forcing F into a constant sheaf, eliminating non-unique descent data.
It exemplifies how projection reduces complex dynamics to simplistic behaviors.
Recursive futarchy.
The positive corollary of the Axiom applies here: all nine principles preserved,
adjunctions respected, redundancy maintained.
Markets and policy model each other reciprocally; Φ is
reweighted continuously; v remains multi-directional; S is explored rather than erased. Recursive futarchy
thus realizes the Sheaf Axiom constructively: Γ(X, F) remains a strict subset of Q
i F(Ui), with ambiguity
and reserves intact. This synthesis illustrates the transition from collapse to resilience through principled
adherence.
Lesson. Across governance, economics, and AI alignment, the same pattern holds: systems collapse when
local sections are forced into premature, unique global gluings. They remain resilient when reserves, ambiguity,
redundancy, and silence are structurally preserved. The Maxim provides a philosophical compass, the Axiom
of Strategic Boundedness translates it into categorical invariants, and the Sheaf Axiom expresses it as local-
to-global law. Together they assert:
A superintelligence remains resilient and inscrutable only when its global behavior is strictly less
than the sum of its local revelations, preserving reserves, ambiguity, and silence as structural
invariants.
13
Lessons Learned: Principles as Field Invariants
The nine principles, together with the unifying theorem and corollaries, show that categorical-sheaf for-
malisms are not abstract ornaments but operational guardrails for real systems. The connections to earlier
analyses clarify this:
Tariffs and sanctions.
These instantiate the violation of Withhold Strategically and Preserve Ambiguity.
Rather than reserves held for resilience, withholding becomes punitive, collapsing Φ into binary tokens (tariffs
as avatars of legitimacy) and twisting v flows into retaliation. The negative corollary applies: such projection
reduces the RSVP lattice to Skinner-box signaling. This pattern exacerbates global economic instability, as
seen in historical trade wars where initial measures lead to prolonged entropic disruptions.
Government shutdowns.
These break Pace Outputs and Diffuse Redundancy.
By routing services
through a single bottleneck, shutdowns halt v abruptly and collapse redundancy, creating entropic spikes
both symbolically (dysfunction narratives) and materially (service backlogs). RSVP analysis shows that such
brittleness corresponds to the collapse of colimit pacing and sheaf overlap. Real-world examples demonstrate
how these events ripple through societies, affecting everything from healthcare to transportation.
RLHF and behaviorism.
Reward-centric alignment violates the Expiatory Gap, Preserve Ambiguity, and
Reject Frontmen. It compresses scalar Φ into binary approvals, suppresses entropy S, and substitutes avatars
(thumbs-up, emojis) for field-level feedback.
The projection collapse corollary formalizes this: (Φ, v, S)
reduced to (±r, δa, 0). This critique extends to broader AI development, where over-reliance on simplistic
feedback hinders true alignment.
Recursive futarchy.
The positive corollary identifies recursive futarchy as the RSVP-compatible alter-
native: adherence to all nine principles guarantees adjoint-preserving recursion.
Scalar legitimacy Φ is
reweighted continuously, vector flows v remain multidirectional, and entropy S is budgeted as exploration.
This enacts the principles not as heuristics but as invariants of systemic coherence. It offers a blueprint for
future governance models that integrate prediction markets with entropy management.
