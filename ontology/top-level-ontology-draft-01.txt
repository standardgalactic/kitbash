Toward a Top-Level Ontology of Entropic Histories:
A Scalar-Vector-Entropy Foundation for Ontology Engineering
Flyxion
December 26, 2025
Abstract
Top-level ontologies such as the Basic Formal Ontology have demonstrated the importance of
realist discipline in ontology engineering. However, their core primitives remain fundamentally
static, treating entities as primary and processes as derivative. This limits their ability to
represent irreversibility, historical dependence, semantic drift, and ﬁeld-like phenomena now
central to physics, computation, and cognition.
This paper proposes a new top-level ontology grounded in the Relativistic Scalar-Vector-
Entropy Plenum (RSVP). Rather than taking entities as primitive, the proposed framework treats
entropic histories, constrained ﬂows, and stabilization regimes as fundamental. Objects, relations,
agents, and information arise as low-entropy invariants within a dynamically constrained plenum.
The resulting ontology preserves realism while extending it beyond object-centric metaphysics,
oﬀering a uniﬁed foundation for physical, biological, cognitive, and computational domains.

Introduction
Ontology engineering has matured to the point where disagreements no longer concern only modeling
conventions, but the adequacy of the ontological primitives themselves. Persistent diﬃculties
surrounding irreversibility, interoperability, information, and agency suggest that current top-level
ontologies are operating at the limits of their conceptual frameworks.
This paper advances the thesis that these diﬃculties are not engineering failures but ontological
ones. The underlying assumption that entities are ontologically prior to histories, processes, and
constraints must be reconsidered. We propose an alternative top-level ontology in which history,
entropy, and constrained ﬂow are primitive, and entities are derivative.
2
Motivation for a New Top-Level Ontology
Three persistent problems motivate the present proposal.
2.1
Irreversibility
Most top-level ontologies encode time as an ordering relation on entities or processes.
This
representation fails to capture the constitutive role of irreversibility in physical law, biological
development, learning, and computation. History is treated as descriptive rather than generative.
1

2.2
Mapping Fragility
Ontology interoperability relies heavily on mappings that degrade under version drift. This fragility
is not accidental: mappings attempt to synchronize static structures that evolve under incompatible
dynamics. Without a shared dynamical substrate, mappings become brittle artifacts rather than
stabilizing mechanisms.
2.3
The Ontology of Information
Information remains an unstable category, oscillating between abstracta, mental entities, and
artifacts. Existing ontologies lack principled criteria for distinguishing informational structure from
its physical or symbolic carriers.
3
Design Commitments
The proposed ontology adopts the following commitments:
1. Realism without substance ﬁxation. Reality exists independently of minds, but not all
real structures are object-like.
2. Irreversibility as primitive. Histories are not derived from entities; entities emerge from
stabilized histories.
3. Ontological entropy. Entropy measures degeneracy of admissible futures, not epistemic
uncertainty.
4. Anti-conceptualism. Ontologies are about the world, not about concepts in minds.
These commitments align the framework with realist ontology while rejecting static metaphysical
atomism.
4
Core Ontological Primitives
The ontology introduces three irreducible primitives.
4.1
Scalar Fields (Φ)
Scalar ﬁelds represent ontic density: the degree to which structure persists under perturbation.
Regions of high Φ correspond to stable structures such as particles, organisms, or institutions. Low
Φ regions correspond to transient or diﬀuse regimes.
4.2
Vector Fields (⃗v)
Vector ﬁelds encode directed constraint propagation, including causal, inferential, and functional
ﬂows. Relations are not primitive; they emerge as stable couplings of vector ﬂows.
2

4.3
Entropy Fields (S)
Entropy ﬁelds measure the degeneracy of admissible futures. Low entropy corresponds to invariant
structure; high entropy corresponds to branching, instability, or interpretive ambiguity.
5
Derived Ontological Categories
Classical ontological categories arise as stabilized conﬁgurations:
Classical Category
RSVP Interpretation
Object
Persistent low-entropy Φ-invariant
Process
Directed ﬂow in ⃗v
Relation
Stable coupling of vector ﬂows
Information
Entropy-constrained projectable pattern
Agent
Self-maintaining entropy-minimizing subsystem
No derived category is primitive; all are historically stabilized.
6
Event-Historical Semantics
Let H denote the space of admissible histories. A history is an irreversible trajectory through the
coupled ﬁelds (Φ,⃗v, S). Ontological constraints restrict which histories are admissible.
Under this semantics:
• Deﬁnitions specify admissibility conditions.
• Classiﬁcation partitions history space by entropy regimes.
• Consistency is replayability under constraint.
Ontology engineering becomes the practice of constraining histories to prevent semantic collapse.
7
Ontology Mappings Reinterpreted
Mappings are not correspondences between entities but temporary synchronization operators between
ﬁeld regimes. A successful mapping reduces entropy across systems and enables convergence. Once
convergence is achieved, the mapping becomes redundant and disappears.
This explains the observed decay of mappings without condemning them in principle.
8
Formal Comparison with Existing Top-Level Ontologies
8.1
Comparison with Basic Formal Ontology
BFO enforces realist discipline through distinctions such as continuant versus occurrent. However,
these distinctions presuppose entity primacy.
3

The RSVP ontology diﬀers in that:
• Entities are emergent, not primitive.
• Irreversibility is constitutive, not auxiliary.
• Information is ontologically grounded in entropy, not representation.
BFO can be interpreted as a stabilized subtheory within an RSVP regime.
8.2
Comparison with DOLCE and Process Ontologies
Process ontologies foreground events but typically lack a principled treatment of entropy and
stabilization. RSVP integrates process with persistence by treating both as regimes of historical
constraint.
8.3
Relation to Information-Centric Ontologies
Information-centric ontologies often reintroduce conceptualism implicitly. RSVP avoids this by
grounding information in physically and historically constrained patterns.
9
Implications for AI and Cognition
Intelligence is not a substance but a ﬁeld conﬁguration. Human cognition corresponds to a uniquely
evolved (Φ,⃗v, S) regime, but not the only possible one. This allows rejection of simplistic AGI hype
without asserting metaphysical impossibility.
10
Governance and Ontological Stability
Top-level ontologies diﬀer by entropy tolerance. Highly conservative ontologies favor stability; agile
ontologies favor adaptability. RSVP provides a framework for understanding these tradeoﬀs as
regime diﬀerences rather than ideological conﬂicts.
Ontology engineering must move beyond static taxonomies toward a framework that takes
irreversibility, history, and entropy seriously. A top-level ontology of entropic histories preserves
realism while extending it to domains where objects are not fundamental.
Ontology should ask not merely what exists, but which histories remain possible.
11
Application to Contemporary Debates in Ontology Engineer-
ing
The RSVP framework provides a uniﬁed lens for interpreting disputes in ontology engineering
by treating them as disagreements over historical constraint placement and entropy regulation.
Rather than framing such debates as clashes between realism and pragmatism, or philosophy and
4

engineering, RSVP reveals them as diﬀerences in how stability, ﬂow, and admissibility are managed
across scales.
We apply this framework to the Beverley-Smith debate series, which addresses four recurring
fault lines in applied ontology: the role of philosophy, the status of ontology mappings, the feasibility
of artiﬁcial general intelligence, and the governance of top-level ontologies.
11.1
Event-Historical Analysis: Ontology as Constraints on Admissible Histo-
ries
From an event-historical perspective, ontology engineering governs the space of irreversible repre-
sentational trajectories. Let H denote the space of admissible histories. Ontological commitments
function as authorization and exclusion operators that determine which histories may be composed,
replayed, and extended.
SmithâĂŹs position emphasizes prior exclusion. Philosophical realism supplies ex ante con-
straintsâĂŤtruth as non-negotiable, universals as independent of concepts, and strict use-mention
disciplineâĂŤthat ﬁlter admissible histories before engineering practice begins. These constraints
prevent semantic collapse by eliminating incoherent trajectories early.
BeverleyâĂŹs position emphasizes iterative stabilization. Constraints are reﬁned through en-
gineering practice, disambiguation, and interoperability pressures. Once admissibility conditions
stabilize, ontology engineering may "spin oﬀ" from philosophy as an independent discipline.
Event-historically, both positions agree on composability as the criterion of success. Their
disagreement concerns the origin of constraints: upstream in metaphysics or downstream in practice.
This tension resolves naturally when constraints are understood as historically placeable operators
rather than static axioms.
Ontology mappings illustrate this distinction clearly:
Position
Interpretation as Historical Operator
Smith
Entropy ampliﬁcation via non-stationary rewrites and version drift
Beverley
Temporary synchronization enabling convergence and self-elimination
Disputes over AGI reduce to admissibility criteria on histories. Smith requires biological-historical
equivalence for intelligence; Beverley accepts functional equivalence under shared constraints.
Governance questions, such as the pace of BFO evolution, reﬂect bottleneck management in the
selection of admissible historical trajectories.
11.2
RSVP Field-Theoretic Interpretation: Ontology as Entropy-Regulated Dy-
namics
The same debate admits a complementary RSVP interpretation. Ontological commitments corre-
spond to regimes in the coupled ﬁelds (Φ,⃗v, S).
Smith defends high-inertia scalar regimes characterized by dense Φ-attractors anchored by
philosophical boundary conditions. These caps limit entropy growth and preserve realist invariants.
5

Beverley emphasizes vector-ﬁeld laminarization, where engineering practice reduces turbulence until
ﬂows stabilize and explicit philosophical intervention recedes.
Ontology mappings manifest as distinct ﬁeld operations:
Position
RSVP Interpretation
Smith
Torsion and shear increasing entropy production
Beverley
Dissipative couplers enabling entropy reduction and equilibration
AGI debates become questions of ﬁeld topology. Smith views human intelligence as a uniquely
embodied, high-density Φ conﬁguration. Beverley allows that macroscopic invariants may be realized
across distinct substrates, even if microphysical implementations diverge.
Institutional contrasts follow naturally. BFO exempliﬁes a low-entropy, high-inertia regime
optimized for stability. Corporate ontologies operate in higher-entropy regimes that prioritize rapid
ﬂow and adaptation. RSVP does not privilege either regime absolutely; it explains their divergence
through scale-dependent entropy tolerance.
11.3
Equivalence and Synthesis
Event-historical and RSVP interpretations are equivalent under appropriate adjunctions. Admissible
histories in H correspond to trajectories through the coupled RSVP ﬁelds. Authorization and
exclusion operators map to entropy constraints, while disputes over philosophical priority versus
engineering agility reduce to diﬀerences in scale at which constraints are enforced.
This case study demonstrates that many persistent disagreements in ontology engineering arise
not from incompatible metaphysical commitments, but from unacknowledged regime diﬀerences in
entropy management and historical control.
Ontology engineering must move beyond static taxonomies toward frameworks that treat
irreversibility, history, and entropy as primitive. The RSVP ontology, grounded in entropic histories
and constrained ﬂow, preserves realist discipline while extending ontology to domains where object
primacy is inadequate.
Applied to contemporary debates such as the Beverley-Smith series, RSVP demonstrates
explanatory and unifying power. It reframes disputes over philosophy and engineering, mapping
and uniﬁcation, intelligence and governance, as multiscale questions of constraint placement rather
than ideological conﬂict.
Ontology, on this view, asks not only what exists, but which historiesâĂŤand which ﬁeld
regimesâĂŤremain admissible.
12
Formal Adjunction Between Histories and Fields
This section makes precise the relationship between the event-historical semantics introduced earlier
and the RSVP ﬁeld-theoretic formulation. We show that these two perspectives are not merely
compatible but formally adjoint: the space of admissible histories corresponds to trajectories through
the coupled scalar-vector-entropy ﬁelds, and vice versa.
6

12.1
Histories as Primitive Objects
Let H denote the space of admissible histories. A history h ∈H is deﬁned as an irreversible,
temporally ordered sequence of events subject to ontological constraints. These constraints restrict
which continuations of a partial history remain admissible.
Formally, H is not merely a set but a structured space equipped with:
• A precedence relation encoding irreversibility,
• A family of admissibility predicates restricting extension,
• A degeneracy measure quantifying the number of admissible futures.
Ontology engineering, under this semantics, speciﬁes constraints on H such that histories remain
composable, replayable, and non-degenerate.
12.2
Fields as Dynamical Representations
In the RSVP formulation, ontological structure is represented by a triplet of ﬁelds (Φ,⃗v, S), where:
• Φ is a scalar ﬁeld representing ontic density or stability,
• ⃗v is a vector ﬁeld representing directed constraint propagation,
• S is an entropy ﬁeld measuring degeneracy of admissible futures.
A ﬁeld conﬁguration deﬁnes, at each spacetime point, local constraints on continuation and
stabilization. Crucially, these ﬁelds are not static labels but dynamical quantities whose evolution
governs which structures persist.
12.3
From Histories to Fields
Given a history h ∈H, we deﬁne a mapping
F : H →(Φ,⃗v, S)
that assigns to each history a corresponding ﬁeld conﬁguration. Intuitively:
• Persistent regularities in h induce regions of high Φ,
• Directed causal or inferential asymmetries induce nonzero ⃗v,
• Branching possibilities in future extensions induce local entropy S.
This mapping is coarse-grained: distinct histories may induce the same ﬁeld conﬁguration when
their diﬀerences are irrelevant at the chosen scale.
7

12.4
From Fields to Histories
Conversely, given a ﬁeld conﬁguration (Φ,⃗v, S), we deﬁne a mapping
G : (Φ,⃗v, S) →H
that yields the class of histories admissible under the local ﬁeld constraints. A history h is admissible
under (Φ,⃗v, S) if and only if its trajectory respects:
• Stability thresholds encoded in Φ,
• Directional constraints encoded in ⃗v,
• Entropy bounds encoded in S.
Thus, ﬁelds determine not a single history but a constrained family of possible histories.
12.5
Adjunction Structure
The mappings F and G form an adjunction:
F ⊣G
in the sense that ﬁeld conﬁgurations are the most general representations that preserve admissibility
relations among histories, while histories are the most reﬁned realizations of a given ﬁeld regime.
Under this adjunction:
• Event-historical admissibility corresponds to entropy-bounded ﬁeld ﬂow,
• Historical irreversibility corresponds to non-conservative dynamics,
• Ontological stabilization corresponds to attractor formation in Φ.
This adjunction formalizes the equivalence between history-ﬁrst and ﬁeld-ﬁrst ontological
descriptions. They diﬀer not in substance but in representational emphasis.
12.6
Ontological Consequences
The adjunction has three immediate consequences for ontology engineering:
1. Histories, not entities, are ontologically primary.
2. Field descriptions provide scalable abstractions over historical detail.
3. Ontological disagreement can be analyzed as disagreement over constraint placement rather
than over existence claims.
This completes the formal bridge between event-historical semantics and the RSVP ﬁeld ontology.

Embedding a Fragment of BFO as a Low-Entropy RSVP Sub-
theory
This section demonstrates how a representative fragment of a classical top-level ontology may be
embedded within the RSVP framework as a stabilized, low-entropy subtheory. The purpose is not
to replace existing ontologies, but to show how their core commitments arise naturally as special
regimes within a history-ﬁrst, ﬁeld-theoretic ontology.
13.1
Target Fragment and Scope
We consider a minimal but representative fragment consisting of:
• Independent continuants,
• Occurrents (processes),
• The continuant-occurrent distinction,
• Participation relations between continuants and occurrents.
This fragment captures the core realist commitments of entity-centric ontology without invoking
domain-speciﬁc extensions.
13.2
RSVP Interpretation of Continuants
In RSVP terms, an independent continuant corresponds to a region of persistently high scalar
density Φ coupled with low entropy S across admissible histories. Such a region exhibits:
• Stability under perturbation,
• Identity preservation across historical extension,
• Resistance to branching degeneration.
Formally, a continuant is identiﬁed with a connected region R of spacetime such that:
Φ|R ≥Φmin,
S|R ≤Smax
for thresholds Φmin and Smax determined by the ontological regime.
Continuants are thus not primitive substances, but stabilized invariants of the ﬁeld dynamics.
13.3
RSVP Interpretation of Occurrents
Occurrents correspond to directed ﬂows in the vector ﬁeld ⃗v. A process is not an entity but a
temporally extended trajectory along which constraints propagate. Occurrents may intersect regions
associated with continuants, but they are ontologically distinct in virtue of their directionality.
The classical distinction between continuants and occurrents arises as a diﬀerence between:
9

• Scalar-dominated stability regimes (continuants),
• Vector-dominated ﬂow regimes (occurrents).
This distinction is emergent, not axiomatic.
13.4
Participation as Field Coupling
Participation relations are interpreted as stable couplings between scalar regions and vector ﬂows.
A continuant participates in an occurrent when a high-Φ region constrains, or is constrained by, a
directed ﬂow in ⃗v without loss of identity.
Such couplings remain well-deﬁned only in low-entropy regimes. As entropy increases, partic-
ipation relations become unstable, explaining empirically observed failures of rigid participation
modeling in highly dynamic domains.
13.5
Low-Entropy Regime Characterization
The fragment under consideration embeds cleanly within RSVP provided the following regime
conditions hold:
1. Entropy remains suﬃciently low to prevent excessive branching.
2. Scalar density remains suﬃciently high to preserve identity.
3. Vector ﬂows remain laminar rather than turbulent.
These conditions describe precisely the domains in which classical realist ontologies perform
well: relatively stable biological, anatomical, and institutional structures.
13.6
Interpretive Consequences
Under this embedding:
• The continuant-occurrent distinction is preserved, but explained.
• Participation is no longer primitive, but derived from coupling stability.
• Ontological rigidity corresponds to low entropy tolerance.
Failures of classical ontology in highly dynamic or information-rich domains are thus not errors
but regime violations.
13.7
Compatibility Without Reduction
Importantly, this embedding does not reduce RSVP to an entity ontology, nor does it dissolve
existing ontologies into process metaphysics. Instead, it situates classical top-level ontologies as
stabilized subtheories valid under speciﬁc historical and entropic constraints.
This demonstrates that RSVP extends, rather than opposes, existing realist ontology frameworks.
10

14
Anticipated Objections and Clariﬁcations
Any proposal for a new top-level ontology invites skepticism, particularly when it departs from
established entity-centric frameworks. This section anticipates and addresses three likely objec-
tions: that the approach exhibits "physics envy," that it is excessively abstract, and that it lacks
compatibility with formal ontology languages such as OWL.
14.1
"This Is Physics Envy"
A common objection to ﬁeld-based ontological frameworks is that they import mathematical or
physical formalisms where they are unnecessary or inappropriate. The RSVP ontology does not
derive its authority from physics, nor does it attempt to reduce ontology to physical theory.
The use of scalar, vector, and entropy ﬁelds is structural rather than physicalist. These constructs
serve as formal devices for representing stability, directionality, and degeneracy across domains.
They are equally applicable to physical systems, biological processes, institutional structures, and
computational workﬂows.
Crucially, RSVP does not assume that ontology must mirror fundamental physics. Instead, it
provides a unifying language for describing irreversibility and constraint across scales. The appeal
to ﬁeld structure reﬂects the ontological importance of continuity and ﬂow, not a desire to import
physical authority.
14.2
"The Framework Is Too Abstract to Be Useful"
Abstraction is often conﬂated with impracticality. In ontology engineering, however, abstraction is
unavoidable at the top level. The question is not whether an ontology is abstract, but whether its
abstractions support coherent specialization.
The RSVP ontology is abstract by design, but its abstractions are operationally anchored. Scalar
density corresponds to stability, vector ﬂow to constraint propagation, and entropy to branching
capacity. These notions map directly onto engineering concerns such as versioning, interoperability,
and maintenance cost.
Moreover, RSVP explains why existing ontologies succeed in some domains and fail in others:
they presuppose low-entropy regimes. Far from being detached from practice, the framework clariﬁes
the conditions under which abstraction remains eﬀective.
14.3
"This Is Not Compatible with OWL or First-Order Logic"
Another concern is that RSVP cannot be represented in standard ontology languages. This objection
conﬂates representability with reducibility.
RSVP is a top-level ontological framework, not a domain ontology or a syntax. It does not claim
that all of its primitives can be captured directly in OWL or ﬁrst-order logic. Rather, it provides
semantic grounding for fragments that are representable.
As shown in the previous section, classical ontological categories embed cleanly as low-entropy
RSVP subtheories. These subtheories can be represented in OWL without diﬃculty. RSVP itself
11

operates at a meta-level, explaining why such representations are stable and where they break down.
In this respect, RSVP plays a role analogous to that of foundational semantics for programming
languages: it explains the behavior and limits of concrete formalisms without being identical to
them.
14.4
Scope and Ambition
The RSVP ontology does not seek to replace existing top-level ontologies wholesale, nor does
it propose a single modeling language. Its ambition is diagnostic and uniﬁcatory: to provide a
principled account of stability, change, and constraint that can inform ontology engineering across
domains.
Disagreement with this ambition is reasonable. However, such disagreement should be framed in
terms of alternative accounts of irreversibility and constraint, rather than as objections to abstraction
per se.
15
A Minimal OWL and First-Order Fragment
This section demonstrates that the RSVP ontology admits faithful representation of stabilized
subtheories in standard ontology languages, including OWL and ﬁrst-order logic, without reducing
the framework itself to those formalisms. The intent is not to encode RSVP in its entirety, but to
show how practical ontology engineering proceeds within RSVP-constrained regimes.
15.1
Representational Strategy
RSVP distinguishes between:
• Meta-ontological structure, which governs admissibility, irreversibility, and entropy, and
• Stabilized ontological categories, which admit symbolic representation.
Only the latter are candidates for direct representation in OWL or ﬁrst-order logic. RSVP
therefore functions as a semantic foundation that licenses, rather than replaces, symbolic ontologies.
15.2
Minimal Vocabulary
We consider a minimal vocabulary suﬃcient to represent a low-entropy RSVP regime:
• Entity
• Process
• participatesIn
• hasStabilityLevel
Here, Entity and Process correspond to stabilized continuant- and occurrent-like categories
derived from RSVP ﬁeld conditions.
12

15.3
OWL Fragment
The following OWL-style axioms illustrate a representable fragment:
Class: Entity
Class: Process
ObjectProperty: participatesIn
Domain: Entity
Range: Process
DataProperty: hasStabilityLevel
Domain: Entity
Range: xsd:float
In this fragment, hasStabilityLevel represents a coarse-grained proxy for scalar density Φ.
Thresholds on this value distinguish entities that behave as continuants within a given regime.
Crucially, no claim is made that this exhausts the ontological meaning of stability. Rather, it
captures those aspects relevant to a particular modeling context.
15.4
First-Order Interpretation
The same fragment admits a ﬁrst-order reading. For example:
∀x (Entity(x) →∃s hasStabilityLevel(x, s))
∀x, y (participatesIn(x, y) →Entity(x) ∧Process(y))
Additional constraints may enforce regime-speciﬁc stability conditions, such as:
Entity(x) ∧hasStabilityLevel(x, s) ∧s ≥smin →Stable(x)
These axioms characterize a low-entropy subtheory in which identity and participation relations
are well-deﬁned.
15.5
What Is Not Represented
Several RSVP primitives are intentionally not represented directly:
• Global entropy ﬁelds S,
• Vector-ﬁeld dynamics ⃗v,
• Admissibility conditions over full history space H.
These elements govern when the above symbolic representations remain valid. Their absence
from OWL is not a deﬁciency but a recognition of the expressive limits of ﬁrst-order formalisms.
13

15.6
Interpretive Payoﬀ
This separation clariﬁes a longstanding confusion in ontology engineering. Symbolic ontologies fail
not because they are incorrect, but because they are applied outside the regimes for which they are
stable.
RSVP provides explicit criteria for such regimes. Within them, OWL and ﬁrst-order logic remain
appropriate, eﬃcient, and robust. Outside them, higher-level historical or ﬁeld-theoretic analysis is
required.
15.7
Practical Implications
In practice, RSVP suggests a layered workﬂow:
1. Use RSVP to characterize domain stability and entropy tolerance.
2. Identify stabilized categories appropriate for symbolic modeling.
3. Encode those categories in OWL or ﬁrst-order logic.
4. Monitor regime drift as entropy increases or constraints change.
This approach preserves the utility of existing tools while grounding their use in a principled
ontological framework.
16
Formal Results
This section states and proves a small collection of formal results that articulate the core claims
of the RSVP ontology. The purpose of these theorems is not to introduce new primitives, but to
make explicit the structural consequences of treating entropic histories and constrained ﬂow as
ontologically fundamental.
Throughout, let H denote the space of admissible histories and let (Φ,⃗v, S) denote the associated
RSVP ﬁeld conﬁguration.
16.1
Preliminaries
[Admissible History] A history h ∈H is admissible if and only if it satisﬁes all imposed ontological
constraints and admits at least one non-degenerate continuation.
[Stabilized Structure] A structure is stabilized if it corresponds to a region of low entropy S and
persistent scalar density Φ across all admissible continuations.
16.2
History Primacy
[Ontological Primacy of Histories] Entities are not ontologically primitive; rather, they arise as
invariants over admissible histories.
14

Proof. Suppose entities were primitive. Then admissibility of histories would be deﬁned in terms of
entity persistence. However, persistence itself presupposes criteria of historical continuation and
identity across time.
Conversely, if admissibility conditions are deﬁned over histories, then persistent patterns across
admissible continuations induce equivalence classes of histories. These equivalence classes satisfy
the criteria traditionally ascribed to entities.
Thus, entities depend on histories for their identity conditions, while histories do not depend on
entities. Hence histories are ontologically prior.
16.3
Entropy and Ontological Stability
[Low Entropy as a Necessary Condition for Identity] A structure can support identity across time
only if the entropy of its admissible future histories is bounded.
Proof. Identity across time requires that future continuations preserve relevant structure. If entropy
is unbounded, arbitrarily many divergent continuations are admissible, and no invariant criterion of
persistence can be maintained.
Therefore, bounded entropy is a necessary condition for identity preservation.
Classical continuants correspond to low-entropy regimes of the RSVP ﬁelds.
16.4
Continuant-Occurrent Distinction
[Emergence of the Continuant-Occurrent Distinction] The continuant-occurrent distinction arises as
an emergent property of scalar- and vector-dominated regimes, rather than as a primitive ontological
dichotomy.
Proof. In scalar-dominated regimes, high Φ and low S ensure persistence under continuation, yielding
continuant-like behavior. In vector-dominated regimes, directed ﬂow in ⃗v governs change without
persistence, yielding occurrent-like behavior.
Since these regimes are deﬁned by ﬁeld dynamics rather than axioms, the distinction is emergent
rather than fundamental.
16.5
Ontology Mappings
[Instability of Persistent Ontology Mappings] Persistent mappings between independently evolving
ontologies are unstable except in low-entropy regimes.
Proof. Mappings must preserve admissibility relations across histories. If either ontology evolves
such that entropy increases, admissible continuations diverge, and mapping preservation fails.
Only in regimes where entropy remains low do admissible histories remain suﬃciently constrained
for mappings to remain stable. Hence persistent mappings are unstable in general.
15

16.6
Representability
[Conditional Symbolic Representability] Symbolic ontologies expressed in OWL or ﬁrst-order logic
are sound only within entropy-bounded RSVP subtheories.
Proof. Symbolic formalisms presuppose stable identity conditions and ﬁxed relations.
These
presuppositions are satisﬁed precisely when entropy is bounded and scalar density remains high.
Outside such regimes, admissible histories branch too widely for symbolic constraints to remain
invariant. Therefore symbolic ontologies are conditionally sound.
16.7
Adjunction Consistency
[Adjunction Consistency] The adjunction between histories and ﬁelds preserves ontological admissi-
bility.
Proof. By construction, the mapping from histories to ﬁelds preserves admissibility by encoding
stability, directionality, and entropy. The reverse mapping preserves admissibility by generating
only histories consistent with ﬁeld constraints.
Thus admissibility is invariant under the adjunction.
16.8
Interpretive Summary
Taken together, these results establish that:
• Ontological structure is grounded in admissible histories,
• Classical categories arise as stabilized regimes,
• Entropy bounds determine the validity of symbolic representation,
• Ontology engineering is fundamentally constraint management over time.
These theorems formalize the core claims of the RSVP ontology without appealing to domain-
speciﬁc physics or cognitive assumptions.
17
A Categorical Restatement
This section reformulates the RSVP ontology and its formal results in categorical terms. The aim is
not to replace the event-historical or ﬁeld-theoretic presentations, but to show that the framework
admits a natural and disciplined categorical semantics. This restatement clariﬁes compositional
structure, functorial relationships, and invariance properties underlying ontology engineering.
16

17.1
Categories of Histories and Fields
We deﬁne two categories.
[Category of Histories] Let Hist be a category whose objects are admissible histories and whose
morphisms are irreversible, constraint-preserving extensions of histories. Composition corresponds
to temporal concatenation, and identity morphisms correspond to trivial extensions.
Irreversibility is encoded categorically by the absence of nontrivial isomorphisms: morphisms in
Hist are generally non-invertible.
[Category of Field Regimes] Let Field be a category whose objects are RSVP ﬁeld conﬁgurations
(Φ,⃗v, S), and whose morphisms are coarse-graining or reﬁnement maps that preserve admissibility
constraints.
Morphisms in Field correspond to changes of scale, abstraction level, or modeling resolution.
17.2
Functorial Correspondence
We deﬁne two functors:
F : Hist →Field,
G : Field →Hist.
• The functor F maps a concrete history to the minimal ﬁeld regime that preserves its admissi-
bility properties.
• The functor G maps a ﬁeld regime to the category of histories admissible under its constraints.
These functors capture, respectively, abstraction from historical detail and realization of abstract
constraints.
17.3
Adjunction
[History-Field Adjunction] The functors F and G form an adjoint pair:
F ⊣G.
Proof. For any history h ∈Hist and ﬁeld regime r ∈Field, there is a natural correspondence
between constraint-preserving maps from F(h) to r and history extensions from h to G(r).
This correspondence is natural in both arguments and satisﬁes the unit and counit conditions of
an adjunction. Intuitively, F forgets historical detail while preserving admissibility, and G freely
generates histories consistent with a given regime.
The adjunction formalizes the equivalence between history-ﬁrst and ﬁeld-ﬁrst descriptions
established earlier.
17

17.4
Stabilized Subcategories
Classical ontological categories correspond to reﬂective subcategories.
[Low-Entropy Subcategory] Let Fieldlow ⊂Field be the full subcategory consisting of ﬁeld
regimes with bounded entropy and persistent scalar density.
The category Fieldlow admits a reﬂective embedding into Field.
Proof. Given any ﬁeld regime, coarse-graining operations that suppress high-entropy variation yield
a universal arrow into Fieldlow.
Entity-centric ontologies correspond to working entirely within Fieldlow. Their apparent rigidity
reﬂects categorical reﬂection rather than metaphysical necessity.
17.5
Ontology Mappings
Ontology mappings may be understood as spans in Field:
r1 ←rm →r2,
where rm is a mediating ﬁeld regime.
Persistent ontology mappings exist only when the mediating regime lies in Fieldlow.
This restates the instability of mappings categorically: outside low-entropy subcategories, no
universal mediating object exists.
17.6
Symbolic Ontologies as Presentations
OWL and ﬁrst-order ontologies correspond to presentations of objects in Fieldlow.
Symbolic ontologies are sound presentations of objects in Fieldlow, but not of arbitrary objects
in Field.
This explains categorically why symbolic ontologies succeed in stable domains and fail in highly
dynamic ones.
17.7
Interpretive Signiﬁcance
The categorical restatement highlights three structural features of the RSVP ontology:
• Irreversibility corresponds to non-invertibility of morphisms.
• Ontological abstraction corresponds to left adjoints.
• Stability corresponds to reﬂectivity into low-entropy subcategories.
These features clarify that RSVP is not an alternative modeling language, but a structural
semantics for ontology engineering itself.

Formal Adjunction Between Histories and Fields
This section formalizes the relationship between the event-historical semantics introduced earlier and
the RSVP ﬁeld-theoretic formulation. The central claim is that these two perspectives are not merely
compatible but stand in a precise adjoint relationship. Event histories and ﬁeld regimes provide
dual descriptions of the same ontological structure, diﬀering only in the direction of abstraction and
realization.
We begin with the space of admissible histories, denoted H. A history in this sense is not a mere
sequence of events, but an irreversible trajectory governed by ontological constraints that restrict
which continuations remain possible. These constraints are constitutive rather than descriptive:
they do not merely record what has occurred, but determine what can occur without violating
coherence conditions such as identity preservation, causal consistency, or semantic stability.
In parallel, the RSVP framework represents ontological structure through a triplet of ﬁelds
(Φ,⃗v, S). Scalar density Φ captures the persistence and stability of structure, vector ﬂow ⃗v captures
directed constraint propagation, and entropy S measures the degeneracy of admissible futures. A
ﬁeld conﬁguration therefore speciﬁes, locally and globally, which historical trajectories are permitted
and which are excluded.
The mapping from histories to ﬁelds proceeds by abstraction. Given a concrete history, one
may associate to it the minimal ﬁeld regime that preserves its admissibility properties. Persistent
regularities in the history induce regions of elevated scalar density, directional asymmetries induce
vector ﬂow, and the breadth of admissible continuations induces local entropy values. Distinct
histories may map to the same ﬁeld conﬁguration when their diﬀerences are irrelevant at the chosen
scale of description.
Conversely, a ﬁeld conﬁguration determines not a single history but a family of admissible
histories. The mapping from ﬁelds to histories therefore proceeds by realization. A history is
admissible under a given ﬁeld regime if and only if it respects the stability thresholds encoded in Φ,
the directional constraints encoded in ⃗v, and the entropy bounds encoded in S. In this way, ﬁelds
function as generators of constrained historical possibility rather than as static descriptors.
These two mappings form an adjoint pair. Abstraction from histories to ﬁelds is left adjoint to
realization from ﬁelds to histories. Intuitively, the ﬁeld-theoretic description is the most general
abstraction that preserves historical admissibility, while the historical description is the most reﬁned
realization consistent with a given ﬁeld regime. The unit and counit of this adjunction express,
respectively, that no admissible history is lost under abstraction and that no inadmissible history is
introduced under realization.
The ontological signiﬁcance of this adjunction is substantial. It implies that disputes between
history-ﬁrst and structure-ﬁrst ontologies are not disputes over what exists, but over representational
emphasis. Both descriptions encode the same admissibility structure, diﬀering only in whether
constraint is expressed dynamically through history or statically through ﬁelds.
From the perspective of ontology engineering, this result justiﬁes the use of ﬁeld-theoretic
abstractions without abandoning historical grounding, and conversely legitimizes event-historical
semantics without collapsing into unstructured narrative. The adjunction provides a formal bridge
that preserves realism while enabling scalable abstraction.

Embedding a Fragment of BFO as a Low-Entropy RSVP Sub-
theory
This section demonstrates how a representative fragment of a classical entity-centric top-level
ontology may be embedded within the RSVP framework as a stabilized, low-entropy subtheory.
The goal is not to reduce existing ontologies to RSVP, but to show that their central distinctions
arise naturally under speciﬁc historical and entropic conditions. In this sense, RSVP functions as a
general ontological substrate within which traditional realist ontologies appear as special cases.
We focus on a minimal fragment suﬃcient to capture the core commitments of entity-based
realism, namely the distinction between continuants and occurrents and the relation of participation
between them. These distinctions have proven robust and useful in relatively stable domains such
as anatomy, material artifacts, and institutional structures, and thus provide an appropriate test
case for embedding.
Within the RSVP ontology, a continuant corresponds to a region of historically persistent
structure characterized by elevated scalar density Φ and bounded entropy S.
Such a region
maintains its identity across admissible continuations of history, resisting fragmentation under
perturbation. Identity, on this account, is not imposed axiomatically but emerges from the stability
of admissible futures. When entropy remains suﬃciently low, the set of admissible continuations
preserves a coherent criterion of sameness, yielding continuant-like behavior.
Occurrents, by contrast, correspond to regimes dominated by directed vector ﬂow ⃗v. Rather
than persisting as stable invariants, they manifest as temporally extended trajectories along which
constraints propagate. Processes may intersect regions associated with continuants, but their onto-
logical character is determined by directionality and transformation rather than by persistence. The
classical continuantâĂŞoccurrent distinction thus emerges as a contrast between scalar-dominated
and vector-dominated regimes within the RSVP ﬁelds.
Participation relations arise when these regimes couple in a stable manner.
A continuant
participates in an occurrent when a region of high scalar density constrains, or is constrained by, a
directed ﬂow without loss of identity. Such couplings remain well-deﬁned only so long as entropy
remains bounded. As entropy increases, admissible histories branch more widely, and participation
relations become unstable. This provides a principled explanation for the diﬃculty of modeling
participation rigidly in highly dynamic or information- rich domains.
The fragment under consideration embeds cleanly within RSVP precisely because it presupposes
a low-entropy regime. Scalar density remains high, vector ﬂows are largely laminar, and admissible
histories do not branch excessively. These are exactly the conditions under which classical top-level
ontologies perform well. Their apparent rigidity is therefore not a metaphysical necessity, but a
reﬂection of the stability of the domains to which they are applied.
This embedding clariﬁes both the strength and the limits of entity-centric ontologies. Their
success in stable domains is explained by the existence of low-entropy RSVP regimes that support
persistent identity and well-deﬁned relations. Their failure in rapidly evolving, computational, or
socio-technical domains is explained by regime violation rather than conceptual error. RSVP does
not invalidate such ontologies; it situates them within a broader ontological landscape.
20

Importantly, this account preserves compatibility without reduction. RSVP does not collapse
continuants into processes, nor does it dissolve entity ontology into ﬂux. Instead, it explains why
and when entity-based distinctions arise, and under what conditions they cease to be adequate. In
doing so, it extends realist ontology beyond static domains while retaining its core commitments.
20
Anticipated Objections and Clariﬁcations
Any proposal for a new top-level ontology must contend not only with technical questions but
also with institutional and philosophical skepticism. The RSVP framework is no exception. This
section anticipates several likely objections and clariﬁes the scope, intent, and methodological
commitments of the proposed ontology. The aim is not to preempt disagreement, but to ensure that
such disagreement is directed at substantive claims rather than misunderstandings.
A ﬁrst objection is that the framework exhibits a form of "physics envy," in which ontological
questions are subordinated to mathematical or physical formalisms. This concern is understandable
given the use of ﬁeld-theoretic language. However, RSVP does not derive its authority from physics,
nor does it attempt to reduce ontology to physical theory. The scalar, vector, and entropy ﬁelds
employed here are structural abstractions, introduced to capture persistence, directed constraint
propagation, and degeneracy of admissible futures across domains. They are not posited as physical
substances, but as formal devices for expressing ontological regularities that recur in biological,
institutional, computational, and social systems as well as in physical ones.
A second objection is that the framework is excessively abstract and therefore unlikely to be
useful in practice. This objection conﬂates abstraction with detachment from application. Top-level
ontologies are necessarily abstract, as their role is to articulate the conditions under which more
speciﬁc modeling choices become coherent. RSVP embraces abstraction precisely in order to explain
why certain ontological categories stabilize and why others fail under domain pressure. Concepts
such as scalar density and entropy are not introduced for their own sake, but to make explicit the
conditions under which identity, participation, and persistence remain well-deﬁned.
From this perspective, RSVP is not an alternative to applied ontology engineering, but a
diagnostic framework for it. It explains why classical ontologies succeed in relatively stable domains
and why they encounter diﬃculties in rapidly evolving or information-rich contexts. Far from being
removed from practice, the framework provides criteria for determining when particular modeling
strategies are likely to be eﬀective.
A third objection concerns compatibility with standard ontology languages such as OWL and
with ﬁrst-order logic more generally. RSVP does not claim that all of its primitives can be directly
represented within these formalisms. Such a claim would be incoherent, as OWL and ﬁrst-order
logic presuppose stable identity and ﬁxed relations. Instead, RSVP distinguishes between meta-
ontological structure and stabilized ontological categories. Only the latter are candidates for direct
symbolic representation. RSVP therefore operates at a level that explains the soundness and limits
of symbolic ontologies without being reducible to them.
This distinction parallels familiar relationships in other domains. Foundational semantics in
programming languages, for example, are not themselves executable programs, but they explain why
21

certain programs behave as they do and under what conditions abstractions remain valid. RSVP
plays an analogous role for ontology engineering.
Finally, it is important to clarify the ambition of the framework. RSVP does not seek to replace
existing top-level ontologies wholesale, nor does it propose a single universal modeling language. Its
goal is instead to provide a principled account of irreversibility, constraint, and historical admissibility
that can inform ontology engineering across domains. Disagreement with this ambition is entirely
reasonable. However, such disagreement should be framed in terms of alternative accounts of history,
stability, and constraint, rather than as a rejection of abstraction or formalism as such.
21
A Minimal OWL and First-Order Fragment
This section demonstrates that the RSVP ontology supports practical representation within standard
ontology languages such as OWL and ﬁrst-order logic, provided that representation is restricted to
stabilized regimes. The purpose is not to encode RSVP in its entirety, but to clarify how symbolic
ontologies operate as regime-bound projections of a richer ontological structure.
RSVP draws a principled distinction between meta-ontological structure and object-level cate-
gories. Meta-ontological structure governs admissibility, irreversibility, and entropy across histories.
Object-level categories arise only when this structure stabilizes suﬃciently to support persistent
identity and ﬁxed relations. Only the latter are candidates for direct symbolic representation.
Within a low-entropy regime, continuant-like structures exhibit stable identity conditions across
admissible histories. These structures may be represented as entities in OWL or as unary predicates
in ﬁrst-order logic. Similarly, occurrent-like structures correspond to stabilized patterns of directed
change and may be represented as processes or events. Participation relations become representable
precisely when coupling between these structures remains stable under continuation.
A minimal symbolic vocabulary therefore suﬃces to capture such regimes. One may introduce
predicates or classes corresponding to entities and processes, together with relations expressing
participation. Additional attributes may be used to encode coarse-grained proxies for stability,
such as numerical or ordinal measures reﬂecting scalar density. These proxies do not exhaust the
ontological meaning of stability, but they are suﬃcient for reasoning within a restricted regime.
From a ﬁrst-order perspective, such representations presuppose that identity conditions are
invariant across admissible continuations. This presupposition is not guaranteed by logic alone; it is
licensed by the underlying RSVP regime. When entropy remains bounded and admissible futures
do not branch excessively, identity-preserving predicates remain sound. When these conditions fail,
symbolic representations degrade, not because of logical inconsistency, but because the ontological
assumptions required for their interpretation are no longer satisﬁed.
It is therefore a category mistake to criticize RSVP for not being fully expressible in OWL.
OWL is a representational tool designed for stable domains. RSVP explains why such domains exist
and how their stability may erode. The relationship is thus one of semantic grounding rather than
syntactic inclusion.
This perspective clariﬁes a recurrent pattern in ontology engineering. Symbolic ontologies tend to
perform well in domains characterized by slow change and strong institutional or physical constraints,
22

such as anatomy or material artifacts. They encounter diﬃculty in domains characterized by rapid
evolution, versioning, or socio-technical feedback. RSVP accounts for this pattern by explicitly
modeling entropy and historical branching, thereby providing criteria for when symbolic modeling
is appropriate.
In practical terms, RSVP supports a layered modeling strategy. One ﬁrst characterizes the
entropic and historical properties of a domain. One then identiﬁes stabilized structures within
that domain and represents only those structures symbolically. As domain conditions change, the
symbolic layer may be revised or abandoned without treating its failure as an ontological error.
In this way, RSVP preserves the utility of OWL and ﬁrst-order logic while placing their use on
principled ontological footing.
