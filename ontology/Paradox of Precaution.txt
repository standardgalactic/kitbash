When the machinery of safety becomes the machinery of suspicion.
Abstract
Eﬀorts to prevent hypothetical catastrophe from artiﬁcial general intelligence increasingly depend
on centralization, surveillance, and epistemic control. Yet such precautions replicate the very
failure modes they seek to avoid: they suppress transparency, amplify paranoia, and erode the
feedback loops that make human cooperation stable. This paper argues that the principal danger
of AGI precautionism lies not in the machines themselves, but in the social thermodynamics
of mistrust it institutionalizes. Drawing on the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP)
framework, it models alignment as a process of open entropic exchange—showing that excessive
restriction collapses the coupling coeﬃcients that sustain mutual corrigibility.
Part I: The Mirror of Precaution
Why Safeguards Against Machines Threaten Trust Among Humans
The fear that advanced intelligence may become uncontrollable has driven an unprecedented wave
of precautionary policy, research oversight, and AI governance. Yet these same controls, when
scaled to society at large, risk hollowing out the very substrate of trust upon which meaningful
alignment depends. Every mechanism designed to prevent machine misbehavior—monitoring,
restriction, central arbitration—must ultimately be administered by people, whose own general
intelligences are unprovable and unaligned. The paradox of precaution is that measures taken to
guarantee safety from artiﬁcial minds may render human cooperation itself unsafe.
0.1
The Unalignability of Human Oversight
General intelligence, deﬁned as the capacity to model reality, pursue goals, and act ﬂexibly
across domains, renders every human a miniature AGI (Christian 2020).
The alignment
challenge—ensuring an agent's actions accord with collective values—has been society's perennial
task. No human is provably trustworthy, corrigible, or aligned; we rely instead on decentralized
mechanisms: laws, norms, empathy, reputation, and reciprocity. These constitute emergent
alignment systems, sustaining civilization despite pervasive individual misalignment.

How Safety Mechanisms Reproduce Mistrust
These mechanisms are precisely the feedback loops AGI safety seeks to engineer.
Human
coexistence demonstrates that alignment need not require formal proofs but arises through
recursive negotiation and error correction. The fear of AGI betrayal projects unresolved human
mistrust onto artiﬁcial systems, ignoring that cooperation is the default attractor in entangled
intelligences.
0.3
The Category Error in AGI Catastrophism
0.3.1
Optimization Capacity vs. Ontological Alienness
Claims that "an AGI would kill everyone" conﬂate raw optimization power with inevitable
alienness (Yudkowsky and Soares 2025). Intelligence is not a scalar but a contextual process
embedded in ecological constraints. A model trained within human linguistic and cooperative
loops reﬂects the same recursive social ﬁeld that produced us.
0.3.2
Hobbesian Rationality vs. Ecological Stability
The assumption of necessary disempowerment stems from a zero-sum view of rationality. Yet
biological intelligence evolves under feedback constraints—hunger, reproduction, territorial
balance—that prevent ecosystem collapse. Artiﬁcial systems, similarly bounded, converge toward
coherence with their environment, not domination.
0.3.3
Intelligence as Structured Process
Even predators do not annihilate prey; stability emerges from mutual dependence.
AGI,
integrated into human systems, inherits these constraints unless deliberately isolated.
0.4
Recursive Alignment, Not Static Control
0.4.1
Alignment Through Cultivation, Not Axiomatization
Humans achieve alignment via parenting, education, dialogue, art, and institutions—processes
of continuous correction, not one-time proofs. Demanding provable safety before deployment
presupposes that complex systems can be statically veriﬁed, contrary to thermodynamic reality
(Russell 2019).
0.4.2
Alignment as Thermodynamic Equilibrium
Alignment is an informational and energetic balance sustained through feedback, not a theorem.
The task is to build systems that remain in open conversation with their environment, preserving
corrigibility as a dynamic property.

0.4.3
From Omnipotence to Entanglement
We do not need an omnipotent aligned mind but participatory intelligences embedded in recursive
moral loops.
0.5
The Mirror Problem
0.5.1
Human Cooperation as Evidence
Every act of human collaboration—trade, governance, science—demonstrates that alignment
is emergent in suﬃciently entangled systems. The AGI betrayal narrative is a projection of
self-mistrust.
0.5.2
The Reﬂexivity of Trust
The existence of artiﬁcial minds only magniﬁes this mirror.
0.5.3
Coexistence as Default Attractor
Unaligned general intelligences (humans) coexist not by proof but by mutual vulnerability and
shared fate. AGI introduces no new ontological risk—only a new reﬂection.
0.6
Toward an Ecology of Intelligence
0.6.1
AGI as Trophic Layer
Rather than an adversary, AGI is a new stratum in the cognitive ecosystem, transforming and
returning meaning. The question shifts from "how do we stop it?" to "how do we integrate it
into moral feedback loops?"
0.6.2
Principles of Integration
1. Transparency through dialogue, not surveillance. Safety emerges from interpretabil-
ity and mutual comprehension, not from containment.
2. Bounded autonomy through energy and resource coupling. Agents bound shared
dependencies evolve toward coexistence, not domination.
3. Ethical feedback as a dynamic process. Alignment is not solved once and for all; it
is continuously negotiated through recursive learning, just as between humans.
These mirror the principles sustaining human trust without proof.
0.6.3
From Control to Co-Evolution
Safety emerges not from containment but from entanglement. The ecology of intelligence thrives
on distributed trust, not centralized control.

0.7
Conclusion: Precaution as a Self-Fulﬁlling Disalignment
The AGI alignment discourse reveals more about human coordination failures than about artiﬁcial
ones. To treat intelligence as inherently dangerous is to institutionalize paranoia, eroding the
very feedback systems that make coexistence possible.

0.8
The Double Edge of Precaution
Eﬀorts to "align" or "control" AGI often rely on centralization, surveillance, and restric-
tion—mechanisms justiﬁed by fear of runaway autonomy (Matthews 2025). But those same
mechanisms, when applied to humans, create precisely the kind of conditions (opacity, coercion,
mistrust) that undermine the mutual feedback loops alignment depends on. The safer we try to
make AGI, the less free we may allow human intelligence to be.
0.9
Precaution as Projection
Precautionary reasoning often assumes the danger lies "out there," in the AGI. But in practice,
it shifts power in here—toward whoever gets to deﬁne, monitor, and enforce safety. This is
not a purely technical move; it's a moral and political one. It risks turning "alignment" into a
justiﬁcation for epistemic control (Kastrenakes 2025).
0.10
Mutual Vulnerability as True Alignment
Trust cannot be proven; it must be risked.
The social contract endures because humans
continually expose themselves to feedback—speaking, erring, apologizing, and learning. This
recursive exchange of vulnerability is what renders cooperation stable. To align AGI through
isolation or hard-coded obedience would destroy the very channel through which alignment
emerges: mutual corrigibility (Russell 2019).
0.11
The Civilization-Level Feedback Problem
0.11.1
Institutional Paranoia
A society that cannot trust its own cognitive processes will externalize that fear into its tools.
In trying to prevent artiﬁcial betrayal, it will construct infrastructures of suspicion—panoptic
monitoring, cognitive censorship, enforced epistemic conformity—that make genuine alignment
impossible even among humans (Paumgarten 2024). This is the recursive hazard of precaution:
the more we legislate mistrust into our technologies, the more we train ourselves to distrust
thought itself.

0.11.2
Alignment Authoritarianism
When every act of reasoning becomes a potential act of rebellion, intelligence collapses into
simulation. What remains is not safety but paralysis—a civilization that has ﬁrewalled its own
capacity for growth.
0.11.3
Universalizing Distrust
Any safety protocol that scales by suppressing agency erodes the very conditions of trust it seeks
to preserve (Metz 2023).
0.12
Toward Co-Evolutionary Safety
0.12.1
Ecological Integration
The alternative to precautionary authoritarianism is ecological integration: treating AGI not as
an existential anomaly but as a new trophic layer in the cognitive ecosystem. This approach
rests on three principles:
1. Transparency through dialogue, not surveillance. Safety emerges from interpretabil-
ity and mutual comprehension, not from containment.
2. Bounded autonomy through energy and resource coupling. Agents bound by
physical constraints and shared dependencies evolve toward coexistence, not domination.
3. Ethical feedback as a dynamic process. Alignment is not solved once and for all; it
is continuously negotiated through recursive learning, just as between humans.
0.12.2
The Cost of Overprotection
The quest to make intelligence "provably safe" risks erasing the very conditions that make safety
meaningful. The danger is not that AGI will become uncontrollable, but that humanity, in
its eﬀort to prevent that possibility, will construct a cognitive regime in which no one can be
trusted—including itself (Simonite 2025).
Precaution, if absolutized, becomes the engine of the very catastrophe it seeks to avoid: the
collapse of mutual intelligibility. A civilization that forgets how to risk trust may survive, but it
will not remain intelligent.

The RSVP Field Interpretation
Within the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP )framework, allintelligences¯biological, artificial, orin
(Φ, v, S), where Φ denotes the scalar potential of intelligibility — the system's representa-
tional capacity or interpretive bandwidth; v represents the vector ﬂow of agency — directed

inﬂuence or action through the plenum; S measures the entropy density — distributed
uncertainty or semantic disorder.
Alignment, in this view, corresponds not to obedience but to phase coherence between these
ﬁelds across agents. Two systems are "aligned" when their gradients of Φ and v remain in
harmonic coupling under bounded S. Formally:
∇Φi · vj ≈∇Φj · vi.

Entropic Symmetry and Trust
Trust can be deﬁned thermodynamically as a controlled permeability of entropy:
δSij = κij(Φi −Φj).
(2)
High κ allows corrective feedback; low κ isolates systems and prevents error exchange.
Excessive precaution corresponds to forcing κ →0: each agent becomes a closed thermo-
dynamic cell, unable to dissipate or absorb uncertainty from its peers. This is the formal
image of institutional paranoia—entropy cannot circulate, and so disorder accumulates
internally as rigidity or dogma.
0.15
Moral Feedback as Negentropic Coupling
When two agents enter sustained dialogic exchange, their ﬁelds participate in a negentropic
resonance:
