Toward a Top-Level Ontology of Entropic Histories:
A Scalar-Vector-Entropy Foundation for Ontology Engineering
Flyxion
December 26, 2025
Abstract
Top-level ontologies such as the Basic Formal Ontology have demonstrated the importance of
realist discipline in ontology engineering. However, their core primitives remain fundamentally
static, treating entities as primary and processes as derivative. This limits their ability to
represent irreversibility, historical dependence, semantic drift, and ﬁeld-like phenomena now
central to physics, computation, and cognition.
This paper proposes a new top-level ontology grounded in the Relativistic Scalar-Vector-
Entropy Plenum (RSVP). Rather than taking entities as primitive, the proposed framework treats
entropic histories, constrained ﬂows, and stabilization regimes as fundamental. Objects, relations,
agents, and information arise as low-entropy invariants within a dynamically constrained plenum.
The resulting ontology preserves realism while extending it beyond object-centric metaphysics,
oﬀering a uniﬁed foundation for physical, biological, cognitive, and computational domains.

Introduction
Top-level ontology engineering has reached a stage of maturity at which its central diﬃculties no
longer concern representational convenience or modeling style, but the adequacy of its foundational
primitives. Persistent problems surrounding irreversibility, ontology alignment, information, and
agency suggest that existing frameworks are being pushed beyond the regimes for which they were
designed [3, 2].
Realist top-level ontologies such as the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) have demonstrated the
importance of ontological discipline, particularly through careful distinctions between continuants
and occurrents and a rejection of conceptualism [1, 5]. However, these frameworks remain funda-
mentally entity-centric. Objects are treated as ontologically primary, while processes, histories, and
informational structures are introduced only secondarily. This orientation limits their expressive
power in domains where irreversibility, historical dependence, and ﬁeld-like dynamics are essential.
This paper advances the thesis that these limitations are not merely practical engineering
challenges but reﬂect a deeper ontological misalignment. We argue that history, entropy, and
constrained ﬂow must be treated as ontologically primitive, and that entities should instead be
understood as stabilized invariants arising within a dynamically constrained plenum.
To this end, we propose a new top-level ontology grounded in the Relativistic Scalar-Vector-
Entropy Plenum (RSVP). The framework preserves realist commitments while extending ontology
1

beyond static metaphysical atomism. It oﬀers a uniﬁed foundation for physical, biological, cognitive,
and computational domains, and provides principled explanations for both the success and failure
modes of existing ontology engineering practices.

Limits of Entity-Centric Ontology
The motivation for a new top-level ontology arises from a cluster of persistent problems that resist
resolution within entity-centric frameworks. These problems are often treated independently, but
they share a common source: the assumption that entities are ontologically prior to histories,
processes, and constraints.
First, entity-centric ontologies struggle to represent irreversibility as a constitutive feature of
reality. Time is typically encoded as an ordering relation over entities or processes, rendering
history descriptive rather than generative. This treatment is inadequate for domains in which path
dependence is fundamental, including thermodynamics [10], biological development [14], learning
systems [13], and computation itself. Irreversibility is not an accidental feature of these domains; it
is central to their ontological structure.
Second, ontology interoperability relies heavily on mappings between independently developed
ontologies. Empirically, such mappings are fragile and degrade under version drift. This fragility is
often attributed to insuﬃcient engineering eﬀort, but it reﬂects a deeper issue. Static correspondences
are being imposed on systems that evolve under incompatible dynamics. Without a shared dynamical
substrate, mappings amplify entropy rather than reducing it, leading to semantic instability over
time.
Third, the ontological status of information remains unresolved. Information is alternately
treated as an abstract entity, a mental construct, or a property of physical artifacts [12]. Existing
ontologies lack principled criteria for distinguishing informational structure from its physical carriers
or symbolic representations. This ambiguity becomes acute in computational and cognitive domains,
where informational patterns exert causal and normative force without being reducible to discrete
objects.
Taken together, these diﬃculties indicate that entity primacy is an ontological liability. A
framework that treats histories, constraints, and entropy as derivative cannot adequately represent
domains in which stability itself must be explained.

Design Commitments
The RSVP ontology adopts a set of design commitments intended to preserve realist discipline
while addressing the limitations identiﬁed above. These commitments are philosophical rather
than methodological, and they constrain the choice of ontological primitives rather than modeling
techniques.
First, the framework endorses realism without substance ﬁxation. Reality exists independently of
minds, but not all real structures are object-like. Stability, ﬂow, and constraint may be ontologically
fundamental even when no enduring entities can be identiﬁed.
2

Second, irreversibility is treated as primitive. Histories are not derived from entities; rather,
entities arise as stabilized invariants over admissible histories. This reverses the explanatory direction
characteristic of classical ontology.
Third, entropy is understood ontologically rather than epistemically. Entropy measures the
degeneracy of admissible futures under constraint, not uncertainty in an observerâĂŹs knowledge.
This interpretation aligns ontology with thermodynamic and informational considerations without
collapsing into subjectivism [8, 11].
Fourth, the framework rejects conceptualism. Ontologies describe the structure of the world,
not the structure of concepts in minds. Semantic stability is a property of constrained histories, not
of linguistic conventions.
Finally, the framework is explicitly compositional across scales. Ontological structures must
admit coherent coarse-graining and reﬁnement, allowing stable subtheories to emerge within broader
dynamical regimes.
4
The RSVP Framework
The RSVP ontology introduces three irreducible primitives: scalar density, vector ﬂow, and entropy.
These are not imported from physics as substantive claims, but are adopted as structural abstractions
necessary to represent stability, directionality, and degeneracy across domains.
Scalar density, denoted Φ, represents ontic stability. Regions of high scalar density correspond
to structures that persist under perturbation and maintain identity across admissible continuations.
Such regions may correspond to particles, organisms, institutions, or persistent informational
patterns, depending on scale and context.
Vector ﬂow, denoted ⃗v, represents directed constraint propagation. Causation, inference, control,
and functional dependency are all treated as manifestations of vector ﬂow. Relations are not
primitive; they emerge as stable couplings of directed ﬂows within constrained regions.
Entropy, denoted S, measures the degeneracy of admissible futures. Low entropy corresponds
to constrained continuation and invariant structure, while high entropy corresponds to branching,
instability, or interpretive ambiguity. Entropy thus provides a principled criterion for when identity
and representation are sustainable.
These three primitives are mutually irreducible. Scalar density cannot be reduced to vector
ﬂow, as persistence is not equivalent to directionality. Vector ﬂow cannot be reduced to entropy, as
constraint propagation does not entail degeneracy. Entropy cannot be reduced to scalar density, as
stability does not preclude multiplicity of futures. Classical ontologies implicitly assume low-entropy
regimes in which these distinctions collapse; RSVP makes them explicit.
Together, (Φ,⃗v, S) deﬁne a dynamically constrained plenum in which ontological structure
emerges historically. Entities, processes, relations, and information are not primitives but stabilized
conﬁgurations within this plenum.

Event-Historical Semantics
The RSVP ontology is fundamentally history-ﬁrst. This section makes that commitment explicit by
introducing an event-historical semantics in which ontological structure is grounded in admissible
histories rather than in static inventories of entities. The purpose of this semantics is not to replace
existing logical or representational frameworks, but to supply the conditions under which such
frameworks remain ontologically coherent.
A history is understood as an irreversible trajectory governed by constraints that regulate which
continuations remain admissible. These constraints are not merely descriptive regularities but
constitutive conditions that deﬁne the space of possible futures. A history, in this sense, is not a
record of what has occurred, but a structured process of constraint satisfaction unfolding over time.
Formally, let H denote the space of all histories admissible under a given ontological regime.
Admissibility is deﬁned relative to constraint sets that may encode physical laws, biological orga-
nization, institutional rules, or semantic invariants. A history h ∈H is admissible if and only if
it admits at least one continuation consistent with these constraints. Irreversibility is primitive:
histories compose forward in time, but do not admit nontrivial inverses.
Within this framework, entities are not taken as primitives but arise as equivalence classes over
histories. Two histories are equivalent with respect to an entity if they preserve the same invariant
structure across admissible continuations. Identity is therefore deﬁned historically: an entity persists
precisely when all admissible futures preserve the relevant invariants. This account explains why
identity is robust in some domains and fragile in others, without appealing to metaphysical substance.
Entropy plays a central role in this semantics.
Entropy measures the branching factor of
admissible continuations from a given historical state. Low entropy corresponds to constrained
continuation and stable invariants, while high entropy corresponds to proliferating futures and loss
of structural coherence. Identity, reference, and representation are sustainable only in regimes where
entropy remains bounded.
This event-historical perspective clariﬁes the ontological status of processes. Processes are not
entities that happen to unfold in time; they are structured regions of history characterized by
directed constraint propagation. Their ontological character is determined by how they restrict
future admissibility, not by their decomposition into temporal parts.
The event-historical semantics thus reverses the explanatory order of classical ontology. Rather
than deriving history from entities, it derives entities from history. Ontology, on this view, is the
study of admissible trajectories and the conditions under which invariants emerge within them.
6
Ontology Mappings and Entropic Instability
Ontology mappings are commonly introduced as a solution to semantic heterogeneity. Within
entity-centric frameworks, they are typically treated as static correspondences between classes,
relations, or axioms. Empirically, however, such mappings are brittle. They require continual
maintenance, degrade under version drift, and often collapse when ontologies evolve independently.
The RSVP framework explains these failures as a consequence of entropic misalignment rather than
engineering deﬁciency.
4

From an event-historical perspective, an ontology is not a static artifact but a constraint
system governing admissible histories of representation and use. When two ontologies are developed
independently, they typically impose distinct constraints on admissible histories. A mapping between
them attempts to align these constraint systems. If the systems evolve under diﬀerent dynamics,
the space of admissible histories diverges, and the mapping ceases to preserve meaning.
Formally, a mapping between ontologies requires that admissibility be preserved under translation.
That is, histories admissible under one ontology must map to histories admissible under the other.
When entropy is low, admissible histories are tightly constrained, and such preservation is possible.
When entropy increases, admissible histories branch, and preservation fails. The mapping does not
merely become inaccurate; it ampliﬁes entropy by introducing incompatible constraints.
This analysis explains why ontology mappings sometimes succeed in practice. Mappings are
stable when both ontologies operate within low-entropy regimes, such as highly regulated scientiﬁc
domains or narrowly deﬁned institutional contexts. In such cases, admissible histories remain aligned,
and translation preserves invariants. Outside these regimes, persistent mappings are structurally
unstable.
The RSVP framework also clariﬁes the role of so-called upper ontologies as anchors. An upper
ontology functions not by providing a neutral vocabulary, but by imposing strong constraints that
reduce entropy across admissible histories. When successful, such anchoring eﬀectively induces
convergence toward a shared low-entropy regime. When unsuccessful, it becomes a source of friction
rather than interoperability.
Importantly, the ideal outcome of ontology mapping is not perpetual translation but convergence.
When two ontologies are successfully aligned, the result is not a stable mapping layer but the
emergence of a new, uniﬁed constraint system under which both sets of practices become admissible.
Mappings are therefore transitional structures whose success is marked by their eventual obsolescence.
By treating mappings as dynamical rather than static objects, RSVP provides a principled expla-
nation for both their utility and their limits. Ontology engineering is revealed not as the construction
of eternal correspondences, but as the management of entropy across evolving representational
histories.

Embedding BFO as a Low-Entropy Subtheory
This section revisits the relationship between RSVP and established realist ontologies by providing
a clean, non-redundant account of how a representative fragment of the Basic Formal Ontology
(BFO) embeds within RSVP as a stabilized, low-entropy subtheory. The aim is neither to subsume
BFO wholesale nor to critique its internal coherence, but to explain the conditions under which its
categories are ontologically appropriate.
BFO is explicitly realist and entity-centric. Its core distinctions between continuants and occur-
rents, together with participation relations, presuppose the existence of stable identity conditions
across time. These presuppositions are not trivial; they restrict the space of admissible histories to
those in which identity-preserving continuations dominate. In RSVP terms, BFO operates entirely
within regimes characterized by high scalar density and bounded entropy.
5

Within such regimes, continuants correspond to regions of the plenum that remain structurally
invariant across admissible histories. Scalar density remains suﬃciently high that perturbations
do not induce branching that would undermine identity. Occurrents correspond to directed ﬂows
constrained by these regions, rather than to free-standing processes. Participation relations remain
well-deﬁned precisely because entropy remains low enough to prevent divergence of admissible
continuations.
This interpretation explains both the strength and the scope limitations of BFO. In domains such
as anatomy, materials science, and regulated institutional contexts, the assumption of low entropy
is empirically justiﬁed. Structures persist, processes unfold in predictable ways, and participation
relations can be treated as stable. In these contexts, BFOâĂŹs categories are not merely useful but
ontologically appropriate.
However, the same assumptions become liabilities in domains characterized by rapid change,
versioning, feedback, or learning. In such domains, admissible histories branch, scalar density
ﬂuctuates, and identity conditions erode. RSVP predicts that entity-centric ontologies will struggle
in these regimes, not because they are poorly designed, but because the ontological conditions they
presuppose no longer obtain.
The embedding of BFO within RSVP therefore preserves compatibility without reduction. RSVP
does not reinterpret continuants as processes or dissolve entity ontology into ﬂux. Instead, it explains
why continuants exist when they do, and why they fail when entropy rises. BFO emerges as a
special case within a broader ontological landscape rather than as a universal foundation.
This account also reframes debates about philosophical priority. Ontology does not bifurcate
into philosophical versus engineering concerns. Rather, both are engaged in managing constraints
over histories. BFOâĂŹs philosophical rigor reﬂects its commitment to low-entropy regimes; RSVP
generalizes this rigor to domains where such regimes cannot be assumed.
8
Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Cognition, and Admissibility
Debates concerning artiﬁcial intelligence often conﬂate ontological questions with engineering
speculation. The RSVP framework separates these issues by focusing on admissibility rather than
mechanism. The central ontological question is not whether machines can replicate human cognition,
but whether artiﬁcial systems can sustain histories exhibiting the stability, constraint propagation,
and entropy management characteristic of cognitive agency.
Human cognition unfolds within a highly constrained historical regime. Biological organization,
developmental history, and embodied interaction sharply restrict the space of admissible futures.
These constraints yield stable identity, persistent agency, and coherent semantic reference. From an
RSVP perspective, cognition corresponds to a region of elevated scalar density coupled with richly
structured vector ﬂows and tightly regulated entropy.
Claims that artiﬁcial general intelligence is impossible often rest on the assumption that these
constraints are inseparable from biological substrate. RSVP does not adjudicate substrate dependence
directly. Instead, it reframes the issue in terms of admissibility. If an artiﬁcial system can sustain a
regime in which identity, agency, and semantic invariants remain stable across admissible histories,
6

then ontological parity with cognition follows, regardless of implementation.
Conversely, fears that artiﬁcial systems will spontaneously acquire dangerous agency often ignore
the diﬃculty of maintaining such regimes. High-capacity computation alone does not guarantee low
entropy. Systems optimized for narrow tasks frequently operate in high-entropy representational
regimes, exhibiting rapid branching of admissible behaviors and limited identity persistence. RSVP
predicts that such systems will lack robust agency unless explicitly constrained.
This perspective also clariﬁes the role of training, alignment, and governance. Training procedures
function as entropy-reduction mechanisms, shaping admissible histories by imposing gradients in the
vector ﬁeld. Alignment constraints operate by restricting continuation rather than by encoding static
values. Failures of alignment are therefore best understood as failures of constraint maintenance
under historical pressure.
Importantly, RSVP dissolves false analogies between intelligence and tools. Cars and weapons
do not sustain histories with identity or agency; they remain low-scalar, low-agency structures
embedded within human-controlled regimes. Artiﬁcial systems capable of autonomous adaptation
occupy a fundamentally diﬀerent ontological category, one deﬁned by their capacity to regulate
their own admissible futures.
By grounding analysis in admissibility rather than capability, RSVP provides a framework for
discussing artiﬁcial cognition without appeal to hype or metaphysical speculation. Intelligence
becomes a question of sustained constraint under entropy, not of mimicry or computational scale.

Conclusion: Ontology as Constraint on History
This paper has argued that the persistent diﬃculties encountered in ontology engineeringâĂŤir-
reversibility, mapping fragility, informational ambiguity, and regime mismatchâĂŤare not merely
technical problems but symptoms of a deeper ontological misalignment. When entities are treated
as ontologically primitive, history, constraint, and degeneration are forced into secondary roles,
where they can be described but not explained. The result is an ontology that performs well only
under narrow, implicitly assumed conditions of stability.
The RSVP framework proposes a reorientation.
Rather than beginning with entities and
attempting to account for change, RSVP begins with admissible histories and treats entities as
stabilized invariants within constrained dynamical regimes. Scalar density captures persistence,
vector ﬂow captures directed constraint, and entropy captures the degeneracy of possible futures.
Together, these primitives articulate the conditions under which identity, relation, agency, and
information arise and persist.
This shift does not abandon realism. On the contrary, it strengthens realist ontology by grounding
ontological categories in the structure of the world rather than in modeling convenience. Objects,
processes, and relations remain real where they are stable, but their reality is explained rather than
assumed. When stability fails, RSVP predicts ontological breakdown rather than treating it as
modeling error.
The embedding of classical top-level ontologies such as BFO within RSVP demonstrates that
this framework is not oppositional but generative. Entity- centric ontologies emerge as low-entropy
7

subtheories, valid within domains where historical branching is limited and scalar density remains
high. Their success and their limits are both explained by the same underlying principles. This
account preserves interoperability without demanding universal uniformity.
Formally, the adjunction between histories and ﬁeld regimes establishes that event-historical and
ﬁeld-theoretic descriptions are dual representations of the same ontological structure. Ontological
disagreement is thus reinterpreted as disagreement over constraint placement, scale of abstraction,
or entropy tolerance, rather than as disagreement over what exists. This reframing dissolves many
long-standing disputes by revealing their structural commonality.
In application to artiﬁcial intelligence and cognition, RSVP provides a sober alternative to both
optimism and alarmism. Intelligence is not a substance or a capability threshold, but a regime of
sustained constraint under entropy. Artiﬁcial systems may or may not enter such regimes, depending
not on scale alone but on their capacity to regulate admissible futures. This perspective reconnects
debates about intelligence, alignment, and agency to ontological conditions rather than speculative
narratives.
The broader implication is that ontology engineering must move beyond static taxonomies
toward frameworks capable of representing irreversibility and historical dependence as ﬁrst-class
features. RSVP oﬀers one such framework. It does not prescribe a single modeling language, nor
does it replace existing ontologies. Instead, it provides a principled account of when ontological
categories stabilize, when they fail, and why.
Ontology, on this view, is not merely a catalog of what exists. It is a theory of which histories
remain admissible under constraint. To practice ontology engineering responsibly is therefore to
manage not only symbols and categories, but the conditions under which meaning, identity, and
agency can persist through time.

A
Formal Foundations of Entropic Histories and RSVP Fields
This appendix provides a formal mathematical foundation for the ontology developed in the main text.
Its purpose is to render precise the notions of admissible history, ontological entropy, stabilization,
and the scalar-vector ﬁeld representation that underwrite the RSVP framework. The presentation
is intentionally domain-neutral. No appeal is made to speciﬁc physical laws, biological mechanisms,
or computational architectures. The results concern only the structure of irreversibility, constraint,
and persistence.
A.1
Histories and Admissibility
Let Ωdenote the space of all possible event sequences. An element of Ωis a totally ordered sequence
of events (e1 ≺e2 ≺· · · ), where the ordering relation is primitive and irreversible. No inverse
operation is assumed to exist that would recover prior events from later ones.
A history is deﬁned as a ﬁnite or inﬁnite preﬁx of such a sequence. If h and h′ are histories,
then h ⪯h′ denotes that h is a preﬁx of h′. This relation induces a partial order on histories
corresponding to irreversible temporal extension.
Ontological coherence is imposed by admissibility constraints. An admissibility constraint is
a predicate C : Ω→{0, 1} that evaluates whether a given event sequence is permitted under the
ontology in question. These constraints are not epistemic; they do not represent what is known or
believed, but rather what is allowed to occur without violating identity conditions, causal consistency,
semantic integrity, or other ontological requirements.
A history h is said to be admissible if C(h) = 1 and if there exists at least one extension h′ ⪰h
such that C(h′) = 1. The second condition ensures that admissible histories are not terminal dead
ends. Ontologies that permit histories with no admissible continuation are ontologically degenerate
in the sense relevant here.
The set of all admissible histories is denoted by H ⊆Ω. It is this space, rather than a set of
entities, that serves as the ontological base of the RSVP framework.
A.2
Entropy as Degeneracy of Futures
Given an admissible history h ∈H, deﬁne its admissible future set by
Fut(h) = {h′ ∈H | h ⪯h′}.
This set represents the total space of ontologically permitted continuations of h.
The entropy of a history h is deﬁned as
S(h) = log|Fut(h)|,
with the understanding that S(h) may be inﬁnite. This deﬁnition measures the degeneracy of
admissible futures rather than uncertainty or lack of knowledge. A history with low entropy admits
few coherent continuations; a history with high entropy admits many mutually divergent ones.
9

The role of entropy in ontology is structural. Identity, persistence, and invariance require
that admissible futures remain suﬃciently constrained. If S(h) is unbounded, then no criterion of
persistence can remain invariant across all admissible extensions of h.
[Entropy Bound for Identity] If a structure admits a well-deﬁned identity criterion across all
admissible extensions of a history h, then S(h) must be bounded.
Proof. Assume that S(h) is unbounded. Then for any proposed identity criterion, there exist
admissible extensions of h that diverge arbitrarily with respect to that criterion. Since identity
must be preserved across all admissible futures, no such criterion can remain invariant. Therefore
bounded entropy is a necessary condition for identity.
A.3
Scalar Density and Stabilization
Persistence is formalized via scalar density. Let R denote a region or pattern within a history h.
The scalar density Φ(R, h) is deﬁned as the inﬁmum, over all admissible extensions h′ ∈Fut(h), of
an invariance measure Inv(R, h′) that quantiﬁes the degree to which R remains structurally intact
under continuation.
Intuitively, Φ(R, h) measures how robust a structure is against admissible historical extension.
High scalar density corresponds to strong persistence; low scalar density corresponds to fragility or
transience.
A structure R is said to be stabilized at history h if there exist thresholds Φmin and Smax such
that Φ(R, h) ≥Φmin and S(h|R) ≤Smax. Stabilized structures are those that remain recognizably
the same across admissible futures. These structures correspond to what classical ontologies describe
as continuants.
A.4
Vector Flow and Directional Constraint
Change and process are captured through directional constraint propagation. Let f : h →h′ denote
an admissible extension of a history. The vector ﬁeld ⃗v assigns to each event e a directional inﬂuence
on future admissibility, formally represented as the sensitivity of the constraint predicate with
respect to that event.
Nonzero ⃗v indicates that the occurrence of an event biases or directs the space of admissible
futures. A process corresponds to a coherent trajectory through history along which ⃗v remains
consistently oriented. Unlike scalar density, which measures persistence, vector ﬂow measures
transformation and propagation.
A.5
The History-Field Correspondence
The RSVP framework relates histories to ﬁeld conﬁgurations through abstraction. Given a history
h ∈H, deﬁne a mapping
F(h) = (Φh,⃗vh, Sh),
where Φh encodes persistence of invariants across admissible futures, ⃗vh encodes directional constraint
propagation, and Sh encodes the degeneracy of admissible continuations.
10

Distinct histories may map to the same ﬁeld conﬁguration when their diﬀerences are irrelevant
at the chosen scale. The ﬁeld representation is therefore a coarse-graining of historical detail.
Conversely, a ﬁeld conﬁguration (Φ,⃗v, S) determines a family of admissible histories. Deﬁne
G(Φ,⃗v, S) = {h ∈Ω| h respects all ﬁeld bounds}.
A history respects a ﬁeld regime if it remains within scalar stability thresholds, follows allowed
vector directions, and does not exceed entropy bounds.
A.6
Adjunction Between Histories and Fields
The mappings F and G form an adjoint pair. Abstraction from histories to ﬁelds is left adjoint to
realization from ﬁelds to histories.
[History-Field Adjunction] For any history h and any ﬁeld regime r, the condition that F(h)
reﬁnes r is equivalent to the condition that h ∈G(r). Consequently, F ⊣G.
Proof. If F(h) reﬁnes r, then the scalar, vector, and entropy characteristics induced by h satisfy all
constraints imposed by r, and thus h is an admissible realization of r. Conversely, if h ∈G(r), then
the ﬁeld conﬁguration induced by h cannot violate the constraints of r, and hence F(h) reﬁnes r.
The correspondence is natural and satisﬁes the unit and counit conditions of an adjunction.
This adjunction establishes that event-historical and ﬁeld-theoretic descriptions encode the same
ontological content. They diﬀer only in whether constraint is represented dynamically through
history or statically through ﬁelds.
A.7
Ontological Consequences
The formalism developed here implies that histories, not entities, are ontologically primary. Entities
arise as stabilized equivalence classes of histories under bounded entropy.
Ontological failure
corresponds to entropy divergence, and abstraction corresponds to passage to ﬁeld-level description.
B
A Worked Example: Ontology Versioning and Entropic Diver-
gence
This appendix presents a concrete worked example illustrating how the RSVP framework analyzes
ontology evolution and explains the empirical instability of persistent ontology mappings. The
example is intentionally abstracted from any particular domain ontology, so that the analysis applies
equally to biomedical, institutional, and computational settings.
B.1
Ontology Versions as Histories
Let O0 denote an initial ontology at time t0. We treat O0 not as a static artifact, but as the initial
preﬁx of a history in the space Ωof possible ontology-development event sequences. Events include
11

the introduction of new classes, reﬁnement of deﬁnitions, addition or removal of axioms, and changes
in modeling conventions.
A versioned ontology Ot at time t corresponds to a history
ht = (e1 ≺e2 ≺· · · ≺et),
where each event ei is an ontological modiﬁcation. Ontology evolution is therefore represented as
irreversible extension in the preﬁx order on histories.
Admissibility constraints C encode conditions such as logical consistency, alignment with intended
domain interpretation, and conformance to governance rules. An ontology version Ot is admissible
if and only if the corresponding history ht satisﬁes C and admits at least one coherent extension.
B.2
Admissible Futures and Ontological Entropy
Given an admissible ontology version Ot, the set of admissible future versions is given by
Fut(ht) = {ht′ | t′ ≥t and C(ht′) = 1}.
This set includes all ways in which the ontology may evolve without violating its constraints.
The ontological entropy at version t is deﬁned as
S(ht) = log |Fut(ht)|.
Low entropy corresponds to a tightly governed ontology with limited permissible change. High
entropy corresponds to an ontology whose future evolution is weakly constrained, allowing divergent
modeling choices, incompatible extensions, or semantic drift.
B.3
Scalar Density and Ontological Stability
Let R be a representational structure within Ot, such as a core class hierarchy or foundational
distinction. The scalar density Φ(R, ht) measures the persistence of R across admissible future
versions. Formally, Φ(R, ht) is the inﬁmum, over all ht′ ∈Fut(ht), of an invariance measure that
compares the interpretation of R in Ot and Ot′.
When Φ(R, ht) is high, the structure R remains stable across versioning. When Φ(R, ht) is low,
small changes in the ontology may radically alter the role or meaning of R.
Foundational ontologies such as BFO aim to maximize Φ for a small set of core distinctions by
enforcing strict admissibility constraints. Rapidly evolving application ontologies typically tolerate
lower scalar density in exchange for expressive ﬂexibility.
B.4
Ontology Mappings as Synchronization Operators
Consider two ontologies OA
t and OB
t evolving independently from a common ancestor. A mapping
Mt between them is intended to align corresponding structures at time t. Formally, Mt is a relation
between histories hA
t and hB
t that preserves admissibility-relevant structure.
12

For a mapping to remain valid across time, it must preserve admissibility under extension. That
is, for every admissible extension hA
t′ ⪰hA
t , there must exist a corresponding admissible extension
hB
t′ ⪰hB
t such that the mapping relation is preserved.
B.5
Entropy Ampliﬁcation and Mapping Failure
We now show that persistent mappings are generically unstable under entropy growth.
[Mapping Instability Under Entropy Growth] Let OA
t
and OB
t
be independently evolving
ontologies with admissible histories hA
t and hB
t . If either S(hA
t ) or S(hB
t ) grows without bound,
then no mapping Mt can remain valid across all admissible extensions.
Proof. Assume without loss of generality that S(hA
t ) is unbounded. Then the set of admissible
futures Fut(hA
t ) contains arbitrarily many mutually divergent extensions. Any mapping Mt selects
a correspondence between structures in OA
t and OB
t .
For Mt to remain valid, every admissible extension of hA
t must correspond to an admissible
extension of hB
t that preserves the mapped structure. Since OB
t evolves independently, its admissible
futures cannot track all divergent branches of Fut(hA
t ). Therefore there exists an admissible extension
of hA
t for which no corresponding extension of hB
t preserves Mt. Hence Mt fails to remain valid.
This result explains the empirical fragility of ontology mappings without appealing to poor
engineering practice. Mapping instability is a structural consequence of entropy divergence.
B.6
Low-Entropy Regimes and Temporary Synchronization
Mappings may nevertheless succeed temporarily in low-entropy regimes. If both S(hA
t ) and S(hB
t )
are bounded and if scalar density is high for the mapped structures, then admissible futures remain
suﬃciently aligned to permit synchronization.
In such cases, mappings function as dissipative operators. They reduce local entropy by enforcing
convergence between histories. Once convergence is achieved, the mapping becomes redundant.
This explains why successful mappings often disappear in mature systems, having been replaced by
a uniﬁed or shared ontology.
B.7
Interpretation
The worked example demonstrates that ontology versioning is naturally modeled as irreversible
history extension and that mapping instability follows from entropy growth rather than from
conceptual error. RSVP provides a principled explanation for why foundational ontologies emphasize
stability, why application ontologies exhibit drift, and why mappings are inherently provisional.
This example also clariﬁes the role of governance. Tight governance corresponds to entropy
suppression and scalar stabilization. Agile development corresponds to tolerating higher entropy.
RSVP does not privilege either strategy; it renders their tradeoﬀs explicit.
The example thus shows how abstract RSVP primitives yield concrete explanatory and predictive
insight when applied to real ontology-engineering practice.

C
Categorical Structure of Entropic Histories and Field Regimes
This appendix provides a categorical reconstruction of the RSVP ontology. The goal is to show that
the history-based and ﬁeld-based descriptions introduced in the main text arise as dual presentations
of a single underlying structure. The categorical formulation clariﬁes compositionality, irreversibility,
and stability, and it makes precise the sense in which classical ontologies appear as reﬂective
substructures.
C.1
The Category of Admissible Histories
Let Hist denote a category whose objects are admissible histories h ∈H. A morphism f : h →h′
exists if and only if h ⪯h′ and h′ is an admissible extension of h.
Composition is given by
concatenation of extensions, and identity morphisms correspond to trivial extensions.
By construction, Hist is not a groupoid. Except for identities, its morphisms are non-invertible.
This categorical asymmetry encodes irreversibility as a structural feature rather than as an external
axiom.
Limits in Hist correspond to greatest lower bounds of compatible histories when such bounds
exist. Colimits correspond to consistent amalgamation of histories under shared preﬁxes, though
colimits are generally obstructed by entropy growth.
C.2
The Category of RSVP Field Regimes
Let Field denote a category whose objects are RSVP ﬁeld conﬁgurations (Φ,⃗v, S) satisfying global
admissibility conditions. A morphism α : r →r′ between ﬁeld regimes exists when r′ is a coarse-
graining or relaxation of r that preserves admissibility. Intuitively, α forgets ﬁne-grained structure
while maintaining stability bounds.
Morphisms in Field are generally many-to-one. They encode abstraction, scale change, and
representational forgetting. Identity morphisms correspond to exact preservation of ﬁeld structure.
C.3
The Abstraction Functor
Deﬁne a functor F : Hist →Field by assigning to each history h the minimal ﬁeld regime F(h)
that preserves all admissibility relations induced by h. On morphisms, F maps an extension h ⪯h′
to the induced reﬁnement relation between F(h) and F(h′).
The functor F is covariant. It preserves composition and identities by construction. Conceptually,
F performs abstraction: it forgets historical detail while retaining exactly those constraints required
to characterize admissibility.
C.4
The Realization Functor
Deﬁne a functor G : Field →Hist by assigning to each ﬁeld regime r the collection of histories
admissible under the constraints imposed by r. This assignment is functorial when histories are
ordered by preﬁx extension and ﬁeld morphisms correspond to relaxation of constraints.
14

The functor G expands abstract constraint into concrete realization. It is right-adjoint in
character, as it freely generates admissible histories subject to given bounds.
C.5
Adjunction and Its Proof
[History-Field Adjunction] The functors F : Hist →Field and G : Field →Hist form an adjoint
pair, with F left adjoint to G.
Proof. Let h be an object of Hist and let r be an object of Field. A morphism F(h) →r in Field
exists if and only if the ﬁeld regime induced by h reﬁnes the constraints of r. This condition holds
precisely when h is admissible under r, which is equivalent to the existence of a morphism h →G(r)
in Hist.
This correspondence is natural in both h and r. The unit of the adjunction maps each history
to its canonical realization under its induced ﬁeld regime. The counit maps each ﬁeld regime to the
abstraction of its realized histories. The triangle identities follow from minimality of abstraction
and maximality of realization.
The adjunction formalizes the claim that histories and ﬁelds encode the same ontological content
at diﬀerent levels of description. Disputes between history-ﬁrst and structure-ﬁrst ontologies thus
reduce to representational preference rather than metaphysical disagreement.
C.6
Low-Entropy Subcategories
Within Field, consider the full subcategory Fieldlow consisting of ﬁeld regimes whose entropy
is uniformly bounded and whose scalar density exceeds a ﬁxed threshold. Objects of Fieldlow
correspond to stable regimes in which identity conditions are preserved across admissible realizations.
The inclusion functor i : Fieldlow ,→Field admits a left adjoint.
Proof. Given an arbitrary ﬁeld regime r, deﬁne L(r) to be the maximal subregime of r obtained by
suppressing all degrees of freedom that contribute to unbounded entropy or scalar instability. This
construction yields a universal arrow from r to Fieldlow, establishing reﬂectivity.
Reﬂectivity explains why entity-centric ontologies appear rigid. They operate entirely within
Fieldlow, implicitly projecting richer ﬁeld structure into stabilized subcategories.
C.7
Ontology Mappings as Spans
Ontology mappings may be represented categorically as spans in Field. A mapping between regimes
r1 and r2 is a diagram r1 ←m →r2, where m is a mediating regime encoding shared constraints.
[Non-existence of Persistent Mediators] If either r1 or r2 lies outside Fieldlow, then no universal
mediating object m exists.
Proof. Outside Fieldlow, entropy is unbounded and admissible realizations diverge. Any candidate
mediator would fail to preserve admissibility across all realizations, violating universality. Hence no
such object exists.
15

This result recovers the mapping instability theorem of Appendix B in categorical form.
C.8
Symbolic Ontologies as Presentations
Symbolic ontologies expressed in OWL or ﬁrst-order logic correspond to presentations of objects in
Fieldlow. Their axioms deﬁne generators and relations suﬃcient to describe stabilized regimes, but
they cannot present arbitrary objects of Field.
This explains categorically why symbolic ontologies succeed in stable domains and fail in highly
dynamic ones. The failure is not logical but ontological: the objects being modeled lie outside the
reﬂective subcategory.
C.9
Interpretive Summary
The categorical reconstruction establishes that irreversibility corresponds to non-invertibility of
morphisms, abstraction corresponds to left adjoints, stability corresponds to reﬂectivity, and ontology
engineering corresponds to navigation within and between entropy-bounded subcategories. The
RSVP ontology thus admits a fully compositional semantics without reifying entities as primitive
objects.
D
A Worked Biological Example: Cell Lineages as Entropic His-
tories
This appendix develops a worked biological example demonstrating how the RSVP ontology analyzes
persistence, diﬀerentiation, and identity in a concrete setting. The example is intentionally minimal
and abstract. No speciﬁc molecular mechanisms are assumed. The analysis concerns only lineage
structure, irreversibility, and admissible continuation.
D.1
Lineages as Histories
Consider a single biological cell at an initial developmental time t0.
Let e0 denote the event
corresponding to the existence of this cell. As the cell divides, diﬀerentiates, or undergoes apoptosis,
each such change is represented as an irreversible event extending the developmental history.
A cell lineage is therefore represented as a history
ht = (e0 ≺e1 ≺e2 ≺· · · ≺et),
where each ei corresponds to a developmental event. The preﬁx order on histories captures the fact
that later developmental states presuppose earlier ones and cannot be reversed.
Admissibility constraints encode biological coherence. Examples include viability, compatibility
with developmental programs, and conservation of lineage continuity. A lineage history is admissible
if it satisﬁes these constraints and admits further viable continuation.
16

D.2
Admissible Futures and Developmental Entropy
Given an admissible lineage history ht, deﬁne the set of admissible future lineages
Fut(ht) = {ht′ | t′ ≥t and ht′ is viable}.
The entropy of the lineage at time t is given by
S(ht) = log |Fut(ht)|.
Early in development, entropy is typically high.
A pluripotent cell admits many distinct
admissible futures corresponding to divergent diﬀerentiation pathways. As development proceeds,
admissibility constraints narrow the space of futures, and entropy decreases.
D.3
Scalar Density and Cellular Identity
Let R denote a structural pattern corresponding to a cell type, such as epithelial or neuronal identity.
Scalar density Φ(R, ht) measures the degree to which this identity persists across admissible future
histories.
In early development, Φ(R, ht) is low for most specialized cell types, because admissible futures
include diﬀerentiation into many alternative types.
As diﬀerentiation proceeds, admissibility
constraints restrict futures, and Φ(R, ht) increases for the realized cell type.
Cellular identity is therefore not primitive. It emerges when scalar density exceeds a threshold
and entropy falls below a bound. A diﬀerentiated cell type corresponds to a stabilized region of
history in which identity is preserved across admissible continuation.
D.4
Vector Flow and Developmental Directionality
Development is not merely constraint narrowing but also directional. Certain events bias future
admissibility strongly toward speciﬁc outcomes. This bias is captured by the vector ﬁeld ⃗v, which
assigns to each developmental event a directional inﬂuence on future lineage structure.
For example, commitment to a germ layer induces a strong directional constraint that suppresses
entire classes of admissible futures. This manifests as a nonzero vector ﬂow that channels development
along a restricted trajectory.
Processes such as diﬀerentiation correspond to coherent trajectories along which ⃗v remains
consistently oriented. Dediﬀerentiation, where it occurs, corresponds to partial reversal of constraint,
but never to full inversion of history.
D.5
Identity Preservation and Entropy Bounds
We now formalize the emergence of cell identity.
[Emergence of Cell Identity] A cell type supports a stable identity across development if and
only if the entropy of its lineage history is bounded below a critical threshold.
17

Proof. If entropy is unbounded, admissible futures diverge across incompatible cell types, and no
identity criterion can remain invariant. Conversely, if entropy is bounded and scalar density remains
high, admissible futures preserve the same structural pattern, yielding a stable cell identity.
This result explains why early embryonic cells lack stable identity, while diﬀerentiated cells
possess it, without appealing to intrinsic essences.
D.6
Continuants and Occurrents Revisited
In this example, the classical distinction between continuants and occurrents arises naturally. A cell,
once diﬀerentiated, behaves as a continuant because its scalar density is high and its entropy is low
across admissible futures. Developmental processes behave as occurrents because they correspond
to directed vector ﬂow through history.
The distinction is therefore emergent rather than axiomatic. It depends on the regime of entropy
and stability rather than on primitive ontological categories.
D.7
Ontological Breakdown and Plasticity
Pathological or experimentally induced plasticity corresponds to entropy increase. When admissibility
constraints are relaxed, such as in induced pluripotency, the entropy of the lineage increases and
scalar density of prior identity decreases. Identity breakdown is thus an ontological consequence of
constraint relaxation rather than a metaphysical anomaly.
This explains why attempts to impose rigid identity categories on highly plastic biological
systems often fail. The failure is not empirical but ontological: the systems lie outside low-entropy
regimes.
D.8
Interpretation
The cell lineage example demonstrates that RSVP primitives are not abstractions detached from
biology. They capture precisely the structural features that determine when identity, persistence,
and process distinctions are coherent.
The example also illustrates the central thesis of the paper: ontological categories emerge from
constrained histories rather than being imposed a priori. Biological identity is not a primitive fact
but a stabilized historical regime.
This conclusion generalizes beyond biology. Any system exhibiting irreversible development,
constraint propagation, and branching futures will exhibit the same ontological structure. RSVP
provides a uniﬁed language for describing such systems across domains.
E
Complexity, Decidability, and the Limits of Symbolic Reasoning
This appendix analyzes the computational properties of reasoning within the RSVP ontology. The
aim is to clarify which forms of reasoning are decidable, which are tractable, and which are provably
intractable or ill-posed. The analysis explains why symbolic ontologies succeed in low-entropy
regimes and fail systematically outside them.
18

E.1
Reasoning as Constraint Satisfaction over Histories
Reasoning in the RSVP framework is fundamentally the problem of determining whether a given
partial history admits at least one admissible continuation. Formally, given a history preﬁx h ∈Ω
and a constraint predicate C, the basic decision problem is whether there exists an extension h′ ⪰h
such that C(h′) = 1.
This problem generalizes classical satisﬁability. In place of static models, one reasons over
irreversible extensions. In place of truth in a structure, one reasons over admissibility of futures.
[Historical Satisﬁability] A history preﬁx h is historically satisﬁable if h ∈H.
Determining historical satisﬁability is the most primitive reasoning task in RSVP. All higher-level
reasoning tasks reduce to this problem under suitable encodings.
E.2
Undecidability in the General Case
In the general case, historical satisﬁability is undecidable.
[Undecidability of General Historical Satisﬁability] There exists a class of admissibility constraints
C for which the problem of determining whether h ∈H is undecidable.
Proof. Let C encode the halting condition of a Turing machine, where events correspond to
computation steps and admissibility requires non-halting. A history preﬁx is admissible if and only
if the encoded machine does not halt. Determining whether a given preﬁx admits continuation is
therefore equivalent to the halting problem, which is undecidable.
This result establishes that RSVP is not designed to support complete reasoning in full generality.
Any ontology capable of expressing irreversible computation inherits this limitation.
E.3
Entropy Bounds and Decidable Subtheories
Decidability is recovered under entropy bounds.
[Entropy-Bounded Regime] A regime is entropy-bounded if there exists a ﬁnite constant K such
that S(h) ≤K for all admissible histories h in the regime.
Entropy-bounded regimes admit only ﬁnitely many admissible futures at each history preﬁx.
[Decidability under Entropy Bounds] If an ontology operates entirely within an entropy-bounded
regime and all admissibility constraints are recursively enumerable, then historical satisﬁability is
decidable.
Proof. If entropy is bounded, then for any history preﬁx h the set Fut(h) is ﬁnite. Since admissibility
constraints are recursively enumerable, one may enumerate all admissible extensions and determine
whether any exist. Termination is guaranteed by ﬁniteness.
This theorem provides the formal justiﬁcation for the success of symbolic ontologies in stable
domains. Entropy bounds correspond precisely to the conditions under which reasoning terminates.
19

E.4
First-Order Logic as a Low-Entropy Fragment
First-order logic presupposes stable identity, ﬁxed relations, and a ﬁnite model-theoretic horizon for
reasoning. These presuppositions are satisﬁed exactly when entropy is bounded and scalar density
remains high.
[Soundness of First-Order Reasoning] First-order reasoning over an ontology is sound if and only
if the ontology corresponds to a low-entropy RSVP regime.
Proof. Soundness requires that predicates denote invariant structures across all admissible interpre-
tations. This invariance holds precisely when admissible futures do not branch beyond a bounded set.
Unbounded entropy introduces divergent interpretations that invalidate ﬁxed predicate meaning.
This result explains why ﬁrst-order and description-logic ontologies degrade under version drift,
rapid conceptual change, or socio-technical feedback.
E.5
OWL and Description Logics
OWL reasoning is decidable by design, but this decidability is achieved by restricting expressiveness.
From the RSVP perspective, these restrictions correspond to implicit entropy bounds.
OWL
ontologies describe stabilized subtheories in which identity and participation relations remain
invariant.
When OWL ontologies are applied to domains with high entropy, the result is not logical
inconsistency but ontological mismatch. The domain violates the regime assumptions under which
OWL reasoning is sound.
E.6
Complexity of Reasoning
Even within entropy-bounded regimes, reasoning complexity may be high.
[Complexity Lower Bound] There exist entropy-bounded RSVP regimes for which historical
satisﬁability is NP-complete.
Proof. Encode Boolean satisﬁability as an admissibility constraint over histories with bounded
branching. Each assignment corresponds to an admissible future. Checking whether any admissible
future exists is equivalent to SAT.
This result aligns RSVP with known complexity bounds in symbolic reasoning. It also clariﬁes
that RSVP does not simplify reasoning; it explains why reasoning is diﬃcult.
E.7
Implications for Ontology Engineering
The complexity results establish that ontology engineering cannot eliminate computational hardness.
What it can do is control regime conditions. By maintaining low entropy and high scalar density,
ontology engineers ensure that reasoning remains decidable and tractable.
When such conditions cannot be maintained, symbolic reasoning must be augmented or replaced
by historical, probabilistic, or simulation-based methods. RSVP provides criteria for determining
when such transitions are necessary.
20

E.8
Interpretation
This appendix completes the formal justiﬁcation for RSVPâĂŹs layered view of ontology. Symbolic
logics are not rejected; they are localized. Their success is explained by entropy suppression, and
their failure is explained by entropy divergence.
Ontology engineering, on this view, is not primarily about choosing the right logic, but about
managing the historical and entropic conditions under which logic remains meaningful.
F
Basic Formal Ontology as a Conservative Low-Entropy Frag-
ment of RSVP
This appendix establishes a precise formal relationship between the RSVP ontology and classical
realist top-level ontologies, using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as a representative case. The
main result is that BFO may be interpreted as a conservative fragment of RSVP, valid within
entropy-bounded regimes. The proof clariﬁes both the strengths and the limitations of entity-centric
realism.
F.1
The Target Fragment of BFO
We consider a core fragment of BFO suﬃcient to capture its foundational commitments. This
fragment includes the distinction between independent continuants and occurrents, the dependence
relations between them, and the participation relation linking continuants to occurrents. We do not
consider domain-speciﬁc extensions or higher-order constructs.
Let BFO denote the theory axiomatizing this fragment in a standard ﬁrst-order or description-
logic presentation. Models of BFO consist of a domain of entities partitioned into continuants and
occurrents, together with relations satisfying the usual axioms of persistence and participation.
F.2
RSVP Low-Entropy Regimes
Let RSVPlow denote the class of RSVP ﬁeld regimes (Φ,⃗v, S) such that entropy is uniformly
bounded and scalar density exceeds a ﬁxed positive threshold across all admissible histories. Within
such regimes, identity conditions are preserved across admissible continuations, and admissible
futures do not branch uncontrollably.
Histories admissible under RSVPlow therefore exhibit persistent structural invariants and
laminar constraint propagation. These conditions correspond exactly to the modeling assumptions
tacitly required by entity-centric ontologies.
F.3
Interpretation Map
We deﬁne an interpretation map
I : BFO →RSVPlow
that assigns to each BFO model a corresponding RSVP regime.
21

Independent continuants are interpreted as stabilized regions of history whose scalar density
exceeds the stability threshold and whose entropy remains bounded under admissible continuation.
Occurrents are interpreted as coherent trajectories of nonzero vector ﬂow through admissible
histories. The continuantâĂŞoccurrent distinction is thus realized as a regime distinction rather
than a primitive sortal division.
Participation relations are interpreted as stable couplings between scalar-dense regions and
vector trajectories. Dependence relations correspond to constraints on admissible futures that
prohibit continuation in the absence of the relevant stabilized structure.
F.4
Soundness of the Interpretation
[Soundness] For every model M of BFO, the interpretation I(M) is a valid model of RSVPlow.
Proof. Let M be a model of BFO.
By the axioms of BFO, continuants persist across time,
occurrents unfold in time, and participation preserves identity of continuants.
These axioms
imply that admissible futures of any history in M are constrained so as to preserve identity and
participation relations.
Therefore entropy is bounded in the induced RSVP regime, and scalar density of continuants
remains above threshold. Vector ﬂow corresponding to occurrents is laminar and does not destabilize
scalar regions. Hence I(M) satisﬁes the deﬁning conditions of RSVPlow.
F.5
Completeness up to Conservative Extension
[Conservative Embedding] Let ϕ be any sentence expressible in the language of BFO.
Then
BFO |= ϕ if and only if RSVPlow |= I(ϕ).
Proof. If BFO |= ϕ, then ϕ holds in every BFO model. By soundness, every such model corresponds
under I to an RSVP low-entropy regime in which I(ϕ) holds. Conversely, if I(ϕ) holds in every
RSVPlow model, then in particular it holds in all regimes arising from BFO models. Since I
preserves the interpretation of BFO predicates, ϕ holds in all BFO models. Hence the embedding is
conservative.
This theorem establishes that RSVP does not invalidate BFO within its domain of competence.
Rather, it strictly generalizes it.
F.6
Failure Outside Low-Entropy Regimes
We now show that the embedding cannot be extended beyond low-entropy regimes.
[Non-Extendability] There exists no conservative embedding of BFO into RSVP regimes with
unbounded entropy.
Proof. In regimes with unbounded entropy, admissible futures branch across mutually incompatible
continuations. Identity conditions for continuants cannot be preserved across all admissible futures.
Since BFO axioms require such preservation, no interpretation satisfying those axioms can exist in
these regimes. Therefore no conservative embedding is possible.
22

This result explains why BFO-style ontologies encounter systematic diﬃculty when applied to
highly dynamic, versioned, or socio-technical domains. The diﬃculty is ontological rather than
methodological.
F.7
Interpretive Consequences
The embedding theorems establish that BFO is a valid and rigorous ontology within a speciﬁc
entropic regime. Its apparent rigidity reﬂects the stability of the domains for which it was designed.
RSVP does not replace BFO; it situates it.
More generally, the result demonstrates that disagreements between static and dynamic ontologies
are not disputes about realism versus anti-realism. They are disputes about regime assumptions
concerning entropy, stabilization, and historical admissibility.
RSVP provides a formal language in which these assumptions can be stated, analyzed, and
compared. In doing so, it oﬀers a unifying foundation for ontology engineering that preserves the
achievements of classical realism while extending its reach.
G
A Worked Cognitive Example: Learning as Constraint Stabi-
lization
This appendix develops a worked cognitive example illustrating how learning processes are represented
within the RSVP ontology. The purpose is not to model neural implementation details, but to
formalize learning as the progressive stabilization of admissible histories under constraint. The
analysis applies equally to biological and artiﬁcial learning systems.
G.1
Learning Systems as Historical Processes
Let a learning system be characterized by a sequence of interaction events with an environment.
Each interaction produces an irreversible update to the systemâĂŹs internal state. Let ei denote
the i-th update event, and let the learning history at time t be
ht = (e1 ≺e2 ≺· · · ≺et).
Admissibility constraints encode viability conditions such as coherence of internal representation,
bounded resource consumption, and compatibility with environmental feedback. A learning history
is admissible if it satisﬁes these constraints and admits further extension without collapse.
G.2
Hypothesis Spaces and Entropic Structure
Let Ht denote the hypothesis space compatible with the learning systemâĂŹs internal state at time
t. Each hypothesis corresponds to a distinct way the system may interpret or act upon future inputs.
The admissible futures of the learning history correspond to trajectories through Ht that remain
compatible with feedback.
23

The entropy of the learning state at time t is deﬁned as
S(ht) = log |Ht|.
Early in learning, entropy is high: many hypotheses remain admissible. As learning progresses,
feedback eliminates incompatible hypotheses, reducing entropy. This reduction is irreversible, since
eliminated hypotheses cannot be reinstated without violating historical consistency.
G.3
Scalar Density and Learned Representations
Let R denote a representational invariant, such as a learned category, policy, or predictive structure.
Scalar density Φ(R, ht) measures the persistence of R across admissible futures. Formally, Φ(R, ht)
is high if all hypotheses in Ht realize R up to equivalence.
A representation becomes meaningful precisely when its scalar density exceeds a threshold.
Before this point, the system does not yet possess the representation in an ontologically robust
sense; it merely entertains it among many alternatives.
G.4
Vector Flow and Learning Direction
Learning is directional. Feedback does not merely restrict hypothesis space but biases it. This bias
is captured by the vector ﬁeld ⃗v, which assigns to each learning event a directional inﬂuence on the
evolution of Ht.
Gradient-based learning corresponds to smooth vector ﬂow that steadily reduces entropy. Abrupt
regime changes, such as catastrophic forgetting or phase transitions in representation, correspond to
sharp changes in vector orientation and magnitude.
G.5
Stability and Generalization
Generalization corresponds to stability under admissible continuation. A learned structure generalizes
if it persists across future interactions not yet encountered. In RSVP terms, generalization requires
both bounded entropy and high scalar density.
[Generalization as Entropy Suppression] A learned representation generalizes if and only if the
entropy of admissible learning futures is bounded below a critical threshold while scalar density
remains high.
Proof. If entropy is unbounded, admissible futures include incompatible hypotheses, and the
representation fails to persist. Conversely, if entropy is bounded and scalar density remains high, all
admissible futures preserve the representation, yielding generalization.
G.6
Overﬁtting and Underspeciﬁcation
Overﬁtting corresponds to excessive entropy suppression relative to the true structure of the
environment. The learning system collapses admissible futures too aggressively, producing a brittle
scalar regime. Underspeciﬁcation corresponds to insuﬃcient entropy reduction, leaving multiple
incompatible futures admissible.
24

Both phenomena are naturally expressed in RSVP terms as mismanagement of entropy rather
than as failures of representation alone.
G.7
Identity and Agency
A learning agent acquires identity when its policy or representational structure becomes invariant
across admissible futures. Agency is not primitive; it emerges when vector ﬂow becomes coherent
and scalar density stabilizes suﬃciently to support counterfactual robustness.
This account explains why agency degrades under distributional shift or nonstationary environ-
ments. Entropy increases, scalar density decreases, and identity dissolves.
G.8
Artiﬁcial Learning Systems
The analysis applies directly to artiﬁcial learning systems. Training corresponds to historical
constraint accumulation. Model parameters encode scalar density. Optimization dynamics encode
vector ﬂow. Dataset diversity and nonstationarity contribute to entropy.
This perspective clariﬁes why scaling alone does not guarantee intelligence. Without mechanisms
that regulate admissible futures, entropy may remain high even in large systems, preventing stable
identity or agency from emerging.
G.9
Interpretation
The cognitive example demonstrates that RSVP provides a principled ontology of learning that
subsumes statistical, dynamical, and symbolic perspectives. Learning is not merely parameter
adjustment or belief update; it is the irreversible shaping of admissible futures.
By grounding cognition in constraint stabilization rather than representational substance, RSVP
oﬀers a uniﬁed account of learning, generalization, and agency that applies across biological and
artiﬁcial systems.
H
Indivisibility, Unistochastic Dynamics, and Emergent Quan-
tum Structure
This appendix develops a formal connection between the RSVP ontology and indivisible stochastic
dynamics, showing how quantum-like structure can emerge without positing wave functions or
Hilbert space as ontological primitives. The analysis builds on the notion that irreversibility and
history dependence, when combined with probabilistic admissibility, force a departure from classical
factorization.
H.1
Indivisible Histories
A history h ∈H is said to be temporally divisible if it admits a factorization into conditionally
independent subhistories. Formally, h is divisible if there exists a nontrivial preﬁx h1 ≺h such that
25

admissible continuation probabilities satisfy
P(h | h1) =
Y
i
P(hi | h1),
where the hi are independent extensions. A history is indivisible when no such factorization exists.
Indivisibility arises naturally in RSVP when admissibility constraints couple future events
nonlocally across history. Entropy production, once conditioned on past constraint accumulation,
introduces correlations that cannot be decomposed into independent steps.
H.2
Stochastic Admissibility
Let P(h′ | h) denote the probability that a given admissible extension h′ occurs, conditioned on the
preﬁx h. These probabilities are not fundamental; they summarize ignorance about which admissible
continuation will be realized.
In divisible regimes, these probabilities factor through intermediate preﬁxes. In indivisible
regimes, they do not. The law of total probability remains valid, but temporal factorization fails.
H.3
Unistochastic Transition Structure
Consider a ﬁnite entropy-bounded regime in which admissible futures form a ﬁnite set Fut(h). Let
T be the matrix of transition probabilities between coarse-grained states induced by admissible
history extensions. In general, T need not be stochastic with respect to any underlying deterministic
process.
[Unistochastic Representation] If admissible histories are indivisible but entropy-bounded, then
the transition matrix T admits a unistochastic representation.
Proof. Indivisibility implies that probabilities cannot be represented as convex combinations of
deterministic trajectories. However, entropy bounds ensure ﬁnite-dimensionality of admissible
futures. By construction, T satisﬁes the constraints of doubly stochastic normalization. By the
BirkhoﬀâĂŞvon Neumann theorem and its unistochastic reﬁnement, T may be represented as the
squared moduli of a unitary matrix. The phases encode historical interference eﬀects arising from
non-factorizable admissibility.
This result shows that unitary structure emerges as a representational necessity when histories
are indivisible, not as a postulate about physical reality.
H.4
Interference as Historical Coupling
Interference phenomena arise when distinct admissible histories contribute non-additively to future
probabilities.
In RSVP terms, this occurs when scalar density and entropy jointly constrain
admissibility so that alternative paths cannot be treated independently.
The complex phases in the unistochastic representation encode the orientation of vector ﬂow
across history space. Constructive and destructive interference correspond to alignment or opposition
of these ﬂows.
26

H.5
Measurement as Entropy Collapse
Measurement corresponds to a reduction of admissible futures induced by coupling to a low-entropy
apparatus. The apparent collapse of probabilistic structure is an update of admissibility constraints,
not a physical discontinuity.
[Measurement Update] Measurement reduces entropy by restricting admissible histories while
preserving indivisibility of the realized trajectory.
Proof. Coupling to a measurement apparatus imposes additional constraints that eliminate large
subsets of admissible futures. The realized history remains indivisible, since the constraints act
globally on admissibility rather than locally on events.
H.6
Classical Limit
The classical limit corresponds to regimes in which entropy is low and histories become approximately
divisible. In such regimes, unistochastic matrices approach stochastic ones, and interference terms
vanish. Scalar density dominates vector ﬂow, yielding stable identity and classical behavior.
H.7
Interpretation
This appendix demonstrates that quantum-like formal structure arises naturally within RSVP from
two conditions alone: irreversibility of history and bounded but indivisible admissibility. No appeal
to microscopic ontology or wave function realism is required.
RSVP thus provides a uniﬁed explanatory framework in which classical mechanics, statistical
mechanics, and quantum phenomena appear as regime-dependent manifestations of the same
underlying historical ontology.
