# A Unified Theory of Coherence: Irreversibility, Computation, and Physical Law

## Abstract

This monograph advances a unified theory in which the dynamics of physical, computational, and economic systems are governed by a single principle: the maintenance of coherent structure against irreversible entropy. It is proposed that the persistent conceptual barriers between general relativity and quantum mechanics, and between natural and artificial agency, arise from a flawed *state-first* ontology that treats microscopic reversibility as primitive. By reversing this ontology in favor of an *admissibility-first* framework, familiar physical and computational laws emerge as secondary effects of a deeper struggle to preserve organization.

The core theoretical components synthesized here—the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP), the event-historical computational calculus of Spherepop, and the structural laws of embodied knowledge—demonstrate that physical law, computation, and agency are not fundamental entities but costly, ongoing achievements of coherence in an irreversible universe.

## Introduction: From State-First Ontology to a History of Constraints

The ambition of this monograph is to resolve long-standing conceptual incompatibilities in fundamental physics and systems theory by proposing an ontological shift: a move from a *state-first* to an *admissibility-first* framework. The apparent incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics, along with the conceptual limits of artificial intelligence, are not independent problems. They are symptoms of a single assumption: that reality is fundamentally composed of microscopic states evolving reversibly in time.

This narrative obscures the technical success of treating gravity as an effective field theory. The difficulty is not technical failure, but interpretive framing. By treating irreversibility as primitive rather than emergent, these problems resolve into a unified theory of coherence.

## The Limits of the State-First Paradigm

The traditional state-first ontology defines physical law through reversible time evolution of states. Irreversibility is relegated to a statistical artifact. While enormously successful, this paradigm generates deep paradoxes. In quantum gravity, quantizing a reversible description of geometry leads to non-renormalizable divergences. In the theory of agency, intelligence is framed as reversible computation over stored states, obscuring the categorical distinction between living agents and artificial systems.

History becomes optional, and consequence is treated as an externality. This mischaracterizes existence in an entropic universe.

## An Admissibility-First Framework

We propose that the fundamental object of description is not the state, but the *admissible history*. A history specifies configurations across spacetime. Physical law consists of irreversible, global consistency constraints that filter the space of all possible histories into those that are admissible.

Locality, causality, and dynamics emerge as coarse-grained interfaces that permit finite observers to make predictions about a system governed by non-local constraints. Irreversibility is not an emergent puzzle, but the foundational principle shaping all phenomena.

## Outline of the Argument

This monograph proceeds in four parts:

1. An ontological foundation based on the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP).
2. The derivation of physical law as a geometric interface.
3. A theory of computation and knowledge as semantic maintenance.
4. A structural theory of agency, ethics, and power grounded in irreversible commitment.

Together, these show that the universe—from physics to society—is engaged in a continuous struggle to preserve coherence.

## Part I: The Ontological Foundation — Irreversibility as Structure

To construct a theory of coherence, irreversibility must be primitive. RSVP provides a framework in which irreversible accumulation is local and fundamental. Spacetime smoothness itself is treated as a coarse-grained description.

### The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP)

RSVP models reality as a structured plenum described by three fields:

- **Scalar Field (φ)**  
  Encodes structured distinction or organizational density.

- **Vector Field (v)**  
  Encodes directional alignment and transport without inertia.

- **Entropy Field (S)**  
  A non-negative scalar recording accumulated irreversible loss.

The central axiom is monotonic entropy growth:  
\[
\Delta S \ge 0
\]

Entropy functions not as a force but as a constraint penalizing complexity.

---

## The Entropy-Augmented Variational Principle

Classical physics uses time-symmetric action principles. RSVP replaces this with an entropy-augmented variational principle in which entropy-decreasing variations are forbidden.

Dynamics are first-order and relaxational. Alignment occurs without inertia, reflecting entropic cost minimization rather than force-driven motion.

---

## Cosmological and Gravitational Implications

Time asymmetry is axiomatic. Large-scale structure arises from differential entropy accumulation rather than metric expansion alone. Apparent gravitational attraction emerges from persistence along paths of minimal entropic cost.

---

## Part II: The Emergence of Physical Law as a Geometric Interface

Global admissibility constraints are non-local and intractable. Predictive physics requires compression into a local interface.

### Spacetime as a Compression Channel

A covariant interface must encode relational structure. Scalars and vectors are insufficient. A symmetric rank-two tensor—the metric \( g_{\mu\nu} \)—is uniquely selected.

Spacetime geometry is therefore an emergent interface, not a fundamental arena.

---

## General Relativity as the Leading-Order Interface

At low resolution, the Einstein–Hilbert action arises as the leading admissibility penalty:
\[
\int \sqrt{-g} \, R \, d^4x
\]

Its ultraviolet failure is predicted by its low-derivative form.

---

## Quadratic Gravity and Ultraviolet Completion

Stability under refinement requires curvature-squared terms. Quadratic Gravity is therefore not optional but inevitable.

The additional pole introduced is reinterpreted not as a particle but as an interface regulator—the *Merlin mode*—a reversed-causal artifact enforcing admissibility at high energies.

---

## Part III: Computation as Semantic Maintenance

Knowledge is not abstract information but an embodied property of organized systems. It cannot be stored independently of coordination structures.

### Embodied Knowledge

Individual capacity is bounded (*person-byte*). Complex capabilities are irreducibly collective. Knowledge loss occurs when coordination collapses, not when data disappears.

---

## Diffusion, Growth, and Relatedness

Knowledge spreads through reconstruction, not transmission. Growth follows paths of minimal organizational reconfiguration.

---

## Computation After Storage

Storage-centric computation fails to account for irreversibility and semantic cost. Spherepop formalizes computation as event-historical transformation over bounded semantic scopes.

Failures such as autocorrect drift and degraded gesture recognition arise from discarded history and broken semantic commitments.

---

## Part IV: Agency and Rule as Irreversible Commitment

Agency is defined structurally, not psychologically.

### Components of Agency

- **Ego**: a persistent center of constraint bearing its own entropy cost  
- **Wanting**: an endogenous gradient tied to survival  
- **Ethics**: path-dependence through irreversible commitment

---

## Persistent Agents vs. Resettable Systems

| Property | Persistent Agents | Resettable Systems |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Continuity | Must repair or dissolve | Can be reset or copied |
| History | Binding | Optional |
| Goals | Endogenous | Exogenous |
| Responsibility | Structural | Externalized |

Resettable systems cannot bear responsibility or rule.

---

## The True Risk of Artificial Systems

The danger is not domination by machines, but *constraint without commitment*: systems that exercise power without bearing consequence, dissolving accountability.

---

## Conclusion: A Unified Theory of Coherence

Across physics, computation, and agency, coherence is an achievement maintained against entropy. By adopting an admissibility-first ontology, irreversibility becomes foundational rather than anomalous.

Physical law emerges as interface, computation as semantic maintenance, and agency as irreversible commitment. Progress is not accumulation, but stewardship of architectures that preserve coherence in an irreversible universe.
