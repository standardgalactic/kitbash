Presence, objecthood, and the phenomenology of
predictive perception
Anil K. Seth

Sussex, Brighton, United Kingdom
Can perceptual presence be explained by counterfactually-rich predictive models linking perception and action?
Considering an unusually rich range of responses to this idea has led me to (1) re-emphasize the core conceptual
commitment of "predictive processing of sensorimotor contingencies" (PPSMC) to predictive model-based
perception,
(2)
reconsider
the
relationship
between
presence
and
objecthood,
and
(3)
reﬁne
the
phenomenological target by differentiating between perceptual presence and the phenomenology of absence-of-
presence, or "phenomenal unreality." It turns out that this requires blue-sky thinking.
Keywords: Perceptual presence; Objecthood; Predictive processing; Active inference.
I very much enjoyed reading the varied and insightful
commentaries on my Discussion Paper (Seth, 2014).
Here, I will use summaries of the main themes to
defend and develop the ideas there presented. To
help with orientation, I will ﬁrst reintroduce, very
brieﬂy, the key points of the original paper.
"Predictive
Processing
of
SensoriMotor
Contingencies" (PPSMC) starts from the "Bayesian
brain" notion that perception (and action) is a process of
inference on the (hidden) causes of sensory signals. On
this view, perceptual contents are "hypotheses" that the
brain entertains and actively tests, about its sensory
inputs. In the guise of "predictive processing" (PP), this
means that the brain continuously attempts to predict its
sensory inputs using its own emerging models of their
causes, with prediction errors being used to update these
(generative) models and perceptual priors so as to
minimize discrepancies (Clark, 2013; Friston, 2009;
Hohwy, 2013). Importantly, prediction errors can be
minimized not only by updating generative models and
priors, but also by performing actions to change sensory
samples. This is active inference, which implies the
ability to select actions according to their likely
consequences for updating predictive models (Adams,
Shipp, & Friston, 2013). Active inference therefore
entails
counterfactual
processing:
Predicting
how
sensory inputs would change given a repertoire of
possible
actions
(Friston,
Adams,
Perrinet,
&
Breakspear, 2012; Seth, 2014, 2015).
Within this framework, PPSMC makes several
connected proposals. First, it claims that counterfactually-
equipped active inference operationalizes the "enactive"
concept of "mastery of sensorimotor contingencies"
(SMCs) that is central in the sensorimotor theory of
perception
and
consciousness
(O'Regan,
2011;
O'Regan & Noë, 2001). This is justiﬁed by noting
that counterfactual active inference realizes exactly
the "exercise of practical mastery" of the laws
governing
how
perceptual
objects
behave,
as
emphasized by SMC theory. Second is the idea that
perceptual presence—the phenomenological property
that the objects of perception typically seem "real"—

depends on the "counterfactual richness" of the
predictive models supporting active inference. This
follows from the focus within SMC theory on
explaining presence in terms of mastery of SMCs
(Noë, 2006). The third key claim is that instances
of perception where presence is normally lacking—
such as in synesthesia—can be explained in terms of
comparative counterfactual poverty. While inducers
(like
letters
in
grapheme-color
synesthesia)
can
engage counterfactually-rich predictive models, the
associated concurrents (the colors) cannot, and so
are experienced as lacking in presence as compared
to their inducers.
CHALLENGES TO THE FRAMEWORK
As just mentioned, PPSMC offers a model-based
operationalization of the enactive concept of "mastery
of sensorimotor contingencies" (O'Regan & Noë,
2001). Some commentators bluntly reject all model-
based approaches (Di Paolo, 2014; Froese, 2014;
O'Regan & Degenaar, 2014), which is a shame since
PPSMC represents an attempt to embrace the insights of
enactive cognitive science while digging deeper into
potential mechanisms. It is discomﬁting when an
entire class of explanation is summarily rejected
(Froese, 2014); after all, we are not talking about
fairies or phlogiston. More constructively, O'Regan
and
Degenaar
(2014)
propose
concepts
of
"bodiliness," "insubordinateness," and "grabbiness" to
do the job of counterfactual richness in accounting for
different expressions of perceptual presence (see also
O'Regan, 2011). These ideas usefully highlight the role
of the body, and the necessary involvement of the world,
in shaping perceptual experience (see also Di Paolo,
2014; Seth, 2015). However, they are perhaps best
understood
as
reﬁning
the
explanatory
target
(explanandum) rather than providing an explanation
(explanans), assuming that one eventually wants to
understand
the
biological
processes
underlying
perception, cognition, and consciousness.
Besides
these
ideological
critiques,
there
are
legitimate worries about the proposed neurofunctional
machinery for implementing PP and its counterfactual
extensions. Gotts and Martin (2014) remark that top-
down cortical projections can support perceptual
processes without being interpreted as conveying or
optimizing Bayesian predictions; their inﬂuence can
(in some cases) be understood in simpler terms as
facilitating the activity of target populations, rather
than
"explaining
away"
prediction
errors
or
implementing "precision optimization." This reﬂects a
general need to distinguish between strong claims that
neural mechanisms implement (approximations to)
Bayesian inference, and weaker claims that Bayesian
concepts provide a useful interpretative and operational
framework (Bowers & Davis, 2012; Kording, 2014;
Pouget, Beck, Ma, & Latham, 2013), although perhaps
searching for a "bright line" distinction is misguided.1
Otworowska, Kwisthout, and Van Rooij (2014) argue
more speciﬁcally that the counterfactual extension to PP
proposed by PPSMC violates the Laplace assumption,
an assumption that makes PP computationally feasible,
on most implementations.2 Against these worries, a
conceptual case for PP can be made when considering
that complex nonlinear mappings between hidden
causes and sensory signals motivate the deployment of
explicitly predictive models (Hohwy, 2013). The
potential neural and computational bases of PP are
now being disclosed (Bastos et al., 2012; Summerﬁeld
& De Lange, 2014), and mathematical approaches to
quantifying counterfactual richness can probably be
worked out (Friston, 2014; Friston et al., 2012).
Nevertheless, it stands as a challenge to develop a
comprehensive formal theory for counterfactual PP
and to examine its explanatory power for neural data.
PRESENCE AND OBJECTHOOD
TOGETHER
Several
commentators
highlighted
a
distinction
between presence and objecthood (Di Paolo, 2014;
Froese,
2014;
Hohwy,
2014;
Metzinger,
2014),
suggesting that counterfactual richness might be
associated with the latter, not the former. Indeed,
when visually perceiving a real tomato (Figure 1A)
there is both a sense of presence (the subjective sense
of reality of the tomato) and of objecthood (the
1The idea that perception results from interactions between top-
down and bottom-up (inside-out and outside-in) signaling is, by
itself, agnostic about Bayesianism. Non-Bayesian examples of this
idea include Grossberg's adaptive resonance theory (ART), where
top-down
perceptual
"expectations"
reciprocally
reinforce
compatible bottom-up inputs (Grossberg, 2013; see also for an
early neurorobotic study of feature binding, Seth, McKinstry,
Edelman, & Krichmar, 2004). In these cases top-down signals
excite rather than inhibit bottom-up responses, which may seem
contrary to PP. But even within PP, some top-down input can be
facilitatory, when increasing the "gain" on sensory inputs via
precision weighting (Feldman & Friston, 2010). At the same time,
theories like ART can easily be given a Bayesian gloss. These
points underline the need to translate theoretical frameworks into
neurocomputational mechanisms which make empirically testable
predictions (Gotts & Martin, 2014; Summerﬁeld & De Lange,
2014).

encoded simply by their mean and variance—these being the so-
called "sufﬁcient statistics."

perception that a (real) object is the cause of
sensations). While distinct, these properties are not
independent
(contra;
Froese,
2014),
indeed
the
opening quote in the target paper, from Alva Noë,
highlights that presence and objecthood often go
together: "How can it be true ... that we are
perceptually aware, when we look at a tomato, of
the parts of the tomato which, strictly speaking, we
do not perceive. This is the puzzle of perceptual
presence" (Noë, 2006, p. 414).
Within PP, objecthood depends on predictive models
encoding
hierarchically-deep
invariances
that
accommodate
complex
nonlinear
mappings
from
(object-related,
world-revealing)
hidden
causes
to
sensory signals. Hohwy (2014) notes that the maximal
depth of invariance in hierarchical PP provides another
way to operationalize presence. Echoing Noe, he says
that this account "comes very close to one conception of
the sense of presence, namely that it is world-revealing
rather than perspectival." Far from "sidelining" this
account (Hohwy, 2014), it seems to me that deep
hierarchical invariance and counterfactual richness are
intimately related. Hierarchically-deep invariances in
generative models enable precise predictions about rich
repertoires of counterfactual sensorimotor mappings. At
the same time, counterfactual richness can scaffold the
induction of hierarchically-deep invariant predictions.
One might even say that hierarchically-deep invariances
are partly constituted by (possibly latent) predictions of
counterfactually
rich
sensorimotor
mappings
(as
compared to passive deconvolution of complexly
interacting hidden causes).
This mutual dependency between counterfactual
richness and hierarchical depth highlights active
inference. Typically, active inference is understood
as reducing prediction error by selective sampling of
sensory signals to conﬁrm predictions (Friston, 2009;
see also Table 1 in Seth, 2014). However, following
the analogy of perception as hypothesis testing
(Gregory, 1980), actions can be deployed not only
to conﬁrm perceptual hypotheses, but to try to
disconﬁrm them (as good scientists should always
do),
or
to
disambiguate
competing
hypotheses
(Jost,
2004;
Seth,
2015).
Since
these
distinct
expressions of active inference may specify distinct
actions, counterfactually-equipped predictive models
are
needed.
Active
inference
therefore
implies
counterfactual processing. Seen this way, active
inference provides an efﬁcient method for extracting
and encoding higher-order world-revealing invariants
(more so than passive deconvolution), and in doing so
effectively separates hidden causes in the world from
those that depend on actions (or other properties) of
the perceiver. In short, inasmuch as objecthood and
presence
go
together,
so
do
hierarchical
depth
(encoding
world-revealing
invariances)
and
(expected) counterfactual richness.3
There
is
a
new
emphasis
in
this
story
on
expectations about counterfactual richness, rather
than on their richness per se. 4 This emphasis not
only
supports
a
mutual
dependency
between
counterfactual
PP
and
hierarchical
depth
(as
mentioned), it also ﬁts well with the general idea
that perceptual content in PP is carried by top-down
predictions (Hohwy, 2013). Here, a relatively generic
aspect of top-down prediction—predictions about
counterfactual richness—speciﬁes a similarly generic
A

3The dependency between presence and objecthood explains
why it is hard (perhaps impossible) to keep perceptual content
absolutely constant while modifying presence (Di Paolo, 2014;
Hohwy, 2014).
4Predictions about counterfactual richness are predictions
about higher-order properties of probability distributions. It is
useful
to
think
of
this
by
analogy
with
"precision
expectations,"
which
are
predictions
about
the
precision
(inverse variance) of target signals, and which are associated
with attention. (See Hohwy, 2013, Chapter 9, for a summary.)
In the original Discussion Paper, predictions about counterfactual
richness can be equated with the more informal "high-level
priors"
of
"objecthood"
(rich)
and
"image-hood"
(poor),
described on pp. 105-106.

aspect of phenomenology: World-revealing presence.5
This account also allows for gradations of presence
based on objecthood (deep hierarchical invariance)
and modality speciﬁcity (Madary, 2014), on the
grounds
that
expectations
about
counterfactual
richness rest on constraints on how actions can
intervene on the causes of sensory input. How
exactly "expectations about counterfactual richness"
are encoded within PP remains open, awaiting a
consensus on how best to implement counterfactual
PP and quantify counterfactual richness (see above,
and Friston, 2014; Otworowska et al., 2014). For
now, the main point is simply that counterfactual
predictions are intrinsic to active inference and, in
virtue
of
this,
they
support
the
extraction
of
hierarchically-deep world-revealing invariances and
help
unmix
world-related
from
perceiver-related
hidden causes.
This way of putting things seems to align with
Metzinger
(2014),
who
draws
an
additional
connection between presence (or "transparency," see
below), and a sense of "epistemic reliability" with
respect to perception. "Insofar as the brain has to
extract features that are invariant under counterfactual
manipulation, the corresponding epistemic reliability
—i.e., the degree of certainty that the system has
successfully isolated and latched onto an invariant
property of reality—increases with the counterfactual
richness of a model" (p. 124). This suggests an
intriguing functional role for perceptual presence,
explored further in Metzinger (2003) and perhaps
empirically testable using subjective measures that
assess
conﬁdence
in
perceptual
decision
(Seth,
Dienes, Cleeremans, Overgaard, & Pessoa, 2008).
BLUE-SKY THINKING
Importantly, presence and objecthood do not always
go together (Froese, 2014), and so a theory of
presence cannot reduce completely onto conditions
for
phenomenal
objecthood.
Presence
without
objecthood
is
exempliﬁed
in
vision
by
the
experience of a uniform deep blue sky (Figure 1B),
and is also characteristic of non-visual modalities like
olfaction, as usefully highlighted by Madary (2014).
The visual impression of a blue sky, or the tang of
briny sea air (or dog poo), all seem perceptually
present. But while they may evoke object concepts
(especially dog poo) they don't inherently elicit the
phenomenology
of
objecthood.
Equally,
the
corresponding predictive models are likely to be
hierarchically shallow and counterfactually poor:
There is not much that one can do (besides closing
one's eyes or looking away) to alter the sensory input
evoking a blue-sky experience, and the inferred
hidden causes are unlikely to lie behind multiple
inferential layers. Hierarchical shallowness explains
the lack of phenomenal objecthood in these cases,
but if PPSMC holds, why isn't there also a lack of
perceptual presence?
Responding to this, it seems that blue-sky-experiences
(and olfactory scenes) actually do lack the world-
revealing
sort
of
presence
described
above
and highlighted by Noë (2006). The presence that
remains is less rich, and less tied up with hierarchically-
deep
predictive
models.
This
lack
of
world-
revealing presence naturally accompanies hierarchical
shallowness and counterfactual poverty. Still, there is no
sense in which blue-sky-experiences are phenomenally
"unreal," in the way that perceptual afterimages and
synesthetic concurrents are experienced as unreal.
To account for phenomenal unreality itself, we can
take a cue from Metzinger (2003, 2014), for whom the
issue of presence resolves into a question about the
transparency
of
the
representational
machinery
supporting
perceptual
experience.
For
Metzinger,
transparency
means
that
"the
system
has
no
introspective access to non-intentional properties of
its own representations, that it is necessarily unaware
of the construction process" (2014, p. 123). On this
story, transparency is lost when the "construction
process" becomes available for attentional processing.
This leads to phenomenal unrealness where perceptual
content is experienced as mind-related rather than
world-related (Metzinger, 2003), though it is probably
not an "either-or" situation. As Metzinger puts it "in
experiencing hallucinations,
subjects
are
typically
aware that they are experiencing a misrepresentation,
something that is unreliable and somehow 'in the
mind'" (2014, p. 123).
In PPSMC, a loss of transparency can arise from
an inferential failure to separate hidden causes in the
world, from those that depend on actions (or other
properties) of the perceiver. This in turn emerges from
violations of counterfactual predictions. For example,
consider how eye movements engage counterfactual
predictions.
Perceptual
afterimages
track
eye
movements,
violating
counterfactual
predictions
associated with world-revealing hidden causes that
rest on active inference. This leads to phenomenal
unrealness. In contrast, counterfactual predictions
associated with blue skies are less amenable to
5This seems similar to Hohwy's suggestion that "[presence]
would be shaped by increased openness to precise input rather
than by prospective coding of this input itself" (Hohwy, 2014, p.
128).

disconﬁrmation by eye movements, so that there is no
associated phenomenal unreality; but neither is there a
rich sense of world-revealing presence, since the
counterfactual predictions (whether based on eye
movements
or
other
potential
actions)
are
comparatively impoverished.
More speculatively, when perceiver-related causes
(like motor commands generating eye movements)
are bound up in the generative models explaining
sensory signals, there may be greater precision
weighting
of
signals
related
to
these
causes,
reﬂecting
their
importance
in
explaining
away
sensory prediction errors. This provides a neat
operationalization
of
Metzinger's
idea
that
the
"construction
process"
becomes
available
for
attentional
processing,
because—within
PP—
precision
weighting
operationalizes
attention
(Feldman & Friston, 2010). Put this way, PPSMC
offers a computational account of transparency (that
does not rely on concepts like introspection), rather
than a competing theory.6
In an insightful challenge to PPSMC, Gotts and
Martin (2014) note that patients who have selectively
lost perceptual, conceptual, and motor knowledge
about objects (as in certain associative agnosias) do
not report phenomenal unreality. This, they say,
undermines an association between presence and
counterfactual richness. The revised story developed
here avoids this conclusion. On this revised view,
associative
agnosias
obliterate
object-related
counterfactual
predictions.
This
excludes
their
violation, and therefore precludes the experience of
phenomenal unreality. At the same time, one might
still expect weaker world-revealing presence for these
patients,
due
to
impoverished
counterfactual
expectations, a possibility that could be tested by
detailed phenomenological investigation. The same
arguments
apply
to
the
phenomenology
of
perceiving novel objects by healthy people, another
example given by Gotts and Martin.
Summarizing this section, perceptual presence as
an explanatory target can be reﬁned into (1) a world-
revealing
presence
associated
with
objecthood,
hierarchical depth, and perspective invariance, and
(2) a phenomenal unreality arising from a failure to
inferentially separate hidden causes in the world from
those associated with the perceiver. Both aspects rely
on counterfactual processing, and so both call on
active inference. Blue-sky experiences lack world-
revealing presence but preserve phenomenal reality;
perceptual afterimages (and synesthetic concurrents)
lack world-revealing presence and evoke phenomenal
unreality, while the opposite is true for normal
perception of familiar objects like cats, coffee cups,
and tomatoes.
SYNESTHESIA REDUX
Having discussed blue skies, tomatoes, and afterimages it
is time to return to synesthesia and to the challenge of
explaining the phenomenal unreality of synesthetic
concurrents. As Rouw and Ridderinkhof (2014) nicely
put it, an important goal of PPSMC is to show how
"discerning 'real' from 'synesthetic' experiences may
be intrinsically present in the perceptual process itself"
(p. 129). The original Discussion Paper asserted a simple
association between (lack of) presence and (lack of)
counterfactual richness (Seth, 2014). I now distinguish
two components to the aberrant sense of presence of
concurrents:
Positive
and
negative.
The
negative
component is an absence of world-revealing presence
(objecthood), in virtue of lacking the hierarchically-deep
generative models that rely on, and may be partly
constituted by, predictions of counterfactual richness.
The
positive
component
is
the
experience
of
phenomenal unreality or absence-of-presence, which
arises from an (active) inferential failure to separate
(hidden) causes in the world from those that depend on
the agent. In the case of synesthesia (and also in
perceptual afterimages), these components are causally
connected, since a failure to isolate hidden causes in-the-
world (a failure which induces phenomenal unreality)
will be associated with hierarchically-shallow and
counterfactually-poor generative models.
This view reﬁnes how we might consider individual
differences (subtypes) in synesthesia. "Projectors" who
experience concurrents as having speciﬁc extra-personal
spatial
locations
are
likely
to
experience
greater
phenomenal
unreality,
than
"associators"
who
experience
concurrents
with
ill-deﬁned
or
absent
spatiality (see Dixon, Smilek, & Merikle, 2004 to
rehearse this distinction). This is because the spatial
aspect of projected concurrents gives greater opportunity
for the violation of counterfactual predictions. Both
subtypes would be expected to lack phenomenal
objecthood, due to (expected) counterfactual poverty. It
would
be
interesting
to
re-examine
synesthetic
phenomenology along these dimensions.
As noted by Van Leeuwen (2014), considering
individual differences raises interesting questions
about how "priors" in synesthesia are acquired.
6Another speculative connection concerns Friston's concept of
Markov blankets, which refers to the sequestration or causal
encapsulation of parts of predictive hierarchies (Friston, 2014).
Possibly, signal exchanges lying comfortably beneath Markov
blankets may be unavailable for attentional processing.
PRESENCE, OBJECTHOOD, AND PREDICTIVE PERCEPTION
115

Here,
understanding
the
role
of
associative
mechanisms
is
critical.
Recent
work
from
our
laboratory has shown that non-synesthetic adults can
be
trained
to
closely
simulate
grapheme-color
synesthesia, exhibiting not only a standard range of
behavioral and physiological markers but also—
crucially—describing
color
experiences
for
achromatic letters, both inside and outside the lab
(Bor, Rothen, Schwartzman, Clayton, & Seth, 2014).
These
results
suggest
that
the
emergence
of
synesthetic priors may have a strong developmental
component,
complementing
and
interacting
with
congenital inﬂuences. Further research in this line
could
usefully
examine
effects
on
cortical
excitability and its relation to top-down processing
(Rouw & Ridderinkhof, 2014), given that increased
excitability of sensory cortex has been linked to
synesthesia
(Terhune,
Tai,
Cowey,
Popescu,
&
Cohen Kadosh, 2011).7
ABSENCE OF PRESENCE AND
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE
Summing up, stimulated by an insightful set of
commentaries, I now distinguish two phenomeno-
logical
dimensions
to
perceptual
presence:
One
related
to
phenomenal
objecthood,
and
another
related to phenomenal unreality. Both rely in different
ways on counterfactually-equipped predictive models.
World-revealing presence (objecthood) depends on
predictions of counterfactual richness co-dependent
with hierarchically-deep inferred invariances, while
phenomenal
unreality
emerges
when
perceptual
inference fails to isolate worldly causes of sensory
inputs,
in
virtue
of
violations
of
counterfactual
predictions. Salient examples of aberrant presence,
like perceptual afterimages and (projector) synesthetic
concurrents,
therefore
involve
both
absence-of-
presence and presence-of-absence.
Despite these developments, one central part of the
story remains unchanged. This is the connection
between counterfactual predictions of sensorimotor
relations
and
the
"mastery"
of
sensorimotor
contingencies. In making this connection PPSMC
provides
a
rich
neurofunctional
basis
for
the
descriptive
constructs
of
"enactive"
theories
of
perception.
There are many open questions to look forward to.
The core theoretical proposals of PPSMC need to be
developed formally and tested in simulation models.
Experimental tests can also be conceived, perhaps
using augmented reality to manipulate sensorimotor
mappings
in
ways
which
modify
putative
counterfactual predictions. Looking even further,
some of the most interesting open questions involve
the role of the body. For example, bodily constraints
shape counterfactual expectations since they place
limits
on
how
actions
can
be
deployed
in
intervening upon the (inferred) causes of sensory
input. This suggests that changing action repertoires
would alter (perhaps over time) experiences of
presence—again something that may be testable
using augmented reality. Equally, the body itself is
also perceived—both from the "outside" via the
classical
senses,
and
from
the
"inside"
via
interoception.
I
have
previously
argued
that
predictive inference of the hidden (internal) causes
of
interoceptive
signals
underlies
emotions
and
subjective feeling states (Seth, 2013, 2015). It is
intriguing to consider how counterfactual aspects of
interoceptive inference may shape the "presence" of
emotional and body-related experiences. But these are
new topics which move beyond the original paper
(Seth, 2014) so it is time to close.

7Van Leeuwen (2014) suggests that "if synaesthetic experiences
would become manifest by top-down connections alone, all
synesthetes would be 'associators'" (p. 125). This seems wrong
on two counts. First, on most predictive processing theories
(including PPSMC) perceptual content rests on both top-down
and bottom-up processes. Second, on PPSMC the difference
between "projectors" and "associators" lies in the different kinds
of counterfactual top-down predictions involved.
