ABSTRACT
In this paper we consider the importance of trust, in the context 
of economic institutions, and specifically with respect to ques­
tions about market mechanisms and the role of social interac­
tions. We review recent advances in institutional economics 
closely tied to developments in philosophy of mind and cogni­
tive science, involving extended and enactive cognition. We 
argue that the analysis of different conceptions of institutional 
mind extension, in Denzau and North's shared mental models, 
Clark's extended mind, and a more enactive approach that 
emphasizes the importance of social interaction and personal 
relationships, can benefit from Kathrine Hawley's distinction 
between reliability and trust. Institutional arrangements based 
solely on the reliability of impersonal mechanisms can lead to 
a variety of social pathologies and, at the extreme, a form of 
cognitive atrophy, all of which can undermine the sustainability 
of institutions. Even if trust comes with risks and some degree of 
unpredictability, it turns out to be a necessary glue-like ingre­
dient in the constitution of social institutions.

1. Introduction
Katherine Hawley (2014) noted that philosophers often distinguish between 
trusting others and trusting (or simply relying on) an instrument. An 
instrument is trusty if it functions properly - does what it is designed to 
do. This is a kind of shallow trust which can be equated with "perceived 
reliability" (David et al., 2021, p. 55). There is no sense that the instrument 
may be dishonest or may try to hide something, or try to mislead me in 
some circumstances, or that it could betray me (Baier, 1986). In contrast, in 
the case of other persons we need to consider just these possibilities. Again, 
as Hawley points out, trust is also something that may (or may not) define 
our relations with institutions or collectives. In this paper we explore the 
notion of trust in personal and institutional relations that include relations

with economic institutions, such as markets. One question is whether we 
should think of trust in (or distrust of) such institutions in terms of 
a shallow instrumental reliability or in terms closer to the deeper trust we 
might have in other persons. After all, institutions are not just tools that we 
can use; they include people and are in some limited way expressions of 
ourselves. To be clear, the question is not, "Should we trust institutions?" - 
rather it is, "What is the nature of the kind of trust that is operative in regard 
to institutions?" This question was raised by Hawley (2014): "it is no 
accident that within this philosophical paradigm we rarely discuss trust or 
distrust as directed toward collective entities, since even the most inflation­
ary accounts of collective agency hold back from treating such entities as 
full-fledged persons in every respect, on a par with individual human 
persons" (pp. 2-3). She also demonstrates the complexity of finding an 
answer given the different ways that philosophers and sociologists define 
groups, organizations and institutions.
We want to explore this question in relation to economic institutions. To 
develop an answer, we take our bearing from the concept of cognitive or 
"mental institution" (Gallagher & Crisafi, 2009). We can trace the development 
of this notion in institutional economics starting from Arthur Denzau and 
Douglass North's (1994) idea of institution understood in terms of "shared 
mental models". Motivated by Denzau and North's views, Andy Clark (1997) 
took this one step further, introducing the notion of "scaffolding institution", 
based on the concept of the extended mind. The notion of cognitive institution, 
or the socially extended mind (Gallagher, 2013), goes even further, drawing on 
4E (embodied, embedded, extended, enactive) cognition, and attempts to 
capture more fundamental and salient aspects of economic institutions, such 
as markets (Gallagher et al., 2019; Petracca & Gallagher, 2020). After summar­
izing these developments, and locating ourselves on the landscape of extended 
and socially extended cognition, we easily find a model of trust that would treat 
the scaffolding institution according to the shallow instrumental version of 
reliability. We argue that this model is insufficient for the dynamical workings 
of the socially extended cognitive institution.
2. Three models of institutions
As Markey-Towler (2017) points out, "adherence, knowing or unknowing, 
to a particular philosophy of mind can have profound effects on the 
ontology of the economy" (p. 203). We think it can also have important 
consequences for how we understand a central concept in economics, 
namely the concept of trust and the related notion of trustworthiness. In 
philosophy of mind, externalist 4E approaches that do not restrict the 
ontology of mind to the internal workings within an individual's head, but 
rather emphasize the constitutive role for embodied and environmental

processes (see, e.g., Newen, De Bruin, & Gallagher 2018), provide alterna­
tives to the more or less standard internalist positions found in institutional 
theory (e.g., Searle, 2005). Consider three such alternatives.
2.1 Shared mental models
Denzau and North (1994) attempt to create something like a bridge between 
the internal realm of representations and the external institution. 
Institutions stem from individuals' "shared mental models", and institu­
tional change takes place when these mental models change (North, 2005). 
"The mental models are the internal representations that individual cogni­
tive systems create to interpret the environment; the institutions are the 
external (to the mind) mechanisms individuals create to structure and order 
the environment" (North, 2005, p. 4). More specifically, they define institu­
tions as "the rules of the game of a society [consisting] of formal and 
informal constraints constructed to order interpersonal relationships." 
The sharing of mental models and the formation of institutions are moti­
vated by an attempt to reduce uncertainty in human, and specifically 
economic relations.
Under conditions of uncertainty, individuals' interpretation of their environment will 
reflect their learning. Individuals with common cultural backgrounds and experiences 
will share reasonably convergent mental models, ideologies, and institutions; and 
individuals with different learning experiences (both cultural and environmental) will 
have different theories (models, ideologies) to interpret their environment.                                                         
(North, 2005, pp. 3-4).
2.2 Extended mind
Clark (1997) focuses more on the external mechanisms, and borrows sig­
nificantly from Denzau and North in order to conceive of institutions as 
structures that provide epistemic scaffolding. As such, they involve strong 
constraints and incentives that predictably direct agents' behaviors. 
Institutions are able to produce a "cognitive economy" guiding individuals' 
decisions and actions. Accordingly, they significantly reduce the cognitive 
effort for information processing, by externalizing a number of processes. 
Clark (1997) suggests that the fact that economic decision-making takes 
place in such highly scaffolded environments explains why neoclassical 
economics - the economics of perfectly rational actors - works "(insofar 
as it works at all)" (p. 271).
This view of economic institutions is consistent with the "extended mind" 
hypothesis (EM) (Clark & Chalmers, 1998; Clark, 2008) - the hypothesis that 
cognitive processes are not limited to what happens in the head but may occur 
218
S. GALLAGHER AND E. PETRACCA

by allowing the body and the external world to do some of the information- 
processing work, for example, using pencil and paper to do math, or 
a notebook to remember addresses. In the EM model, the emphasis falls on 
the use of factors external to brain and body (instruments and tools) that may 
become part of the overall cognitive system. This extension of the mechanisms 
(or vehicles) of cognition includes specific kinds of actions that manipulate an 
external tool or instrument in a way that is functionally equivalent to processes 
that occur in the head (Clark & Chalmers, 1998). Clark and Chalmers empha­
sized functional equivalence in what became known as the "parity principle".
If, as we confront some task, a part of the world functions as a process which, were it 
done in the head, we would have no hesitation in recognizing as part of the cognitive 
process, then that part of the world is (so we claim) part of the cognitive process.                                             
(1998, p. 8).
The parity principle states that information processing done via the use of 
external tools and instruments can be functionally equivalent to informa­
tion processing done by neural mechanisms in the brain.
In what is sometimes called the "second wave" of the extended mind 
theory (Sutton, 2010), the notion of functional integration came to hold 
more importance. Second wave theorists challenge the parity principle. 
Even if in some cases there is a functional isomorphism between inner 
and outer processes, as John Sutton (2010) makes clear, there may also be 
many significant differences.
Sutton defends the importance of complementarity, indexed by differ­
ences in individual cognizers, and differences in particular environments. 
Richard Menary (2007) puts this in terms of an integration that is generated 
in specific kinds of cognitive or epistemic practices. One gets an integrated 
cognitive system, not because there is an automatic fit between neural 
processes and pieces of the environment, but because there is an active 
coupling involving reciprocal causal connections activated by active bodily 
manipulations of the environment. These manipulations, according to 
Menary (2010) include epistemic actions, sensory-motor couplings, the 
use of language and props to guide completion of tasks, and cognitive 
practices. The latter involve "the manipulation of external representational 
and notational systems according to certain normative practices - as in 
mathematics" (p. 237). Numbers, diagrams, drawings, maps, charts, etc. are 
external representations that allow us to accomplish cognitive tasks. We 
manipulate such things using pencils and paper, computers, reorganizing 
spatial arrangements, and we do so following norms that are culturally 
established and learned.

2.3 Socially extended mind
The idea of the socially extended mental (SEM) or cognitive institution has 
been associated with a "third wave" of extended mind (Cash, 2013; 
Kirchhoff, 2012). Regardless of how one defines these theoretical waves, 
we can say that SEM institutions return to the idea of institutions in a way 
that incorporates a second wave perspective that emphasizes active integra­
tion. Clark and Chalmers (1998, pp. 17-18) had anticipated the role of the 
social environment in suggesting that "my mental states might be partly 
constituted by the mental states of other thinkers . . . . one's beliefs might be 
embodied in one's secretary, one's accountant, or one's collaborator." The 
SEM institution, however, takes the idea that cognition may be a matter of 
shared communication, shaped by normative practices, much further. It 
suggests that just such practices allow for the establishment of cognitive 
institutions (Gallagher, 2013). In other words, extended mind is not just 
about the use of hand-held notebooks, writing tablets, iPhones, diagrams, 
maps, or specific kinds of exograms, etc. It's also about our use of, or our 
engagement with large-scale institutions - academic, scientific, cultural, 
economic, legal, etc. These are institutions that enable cognition, and, 
indeed, as we engage with them, they allow for specific types of cognitive 
accomplishments. This to the point of altogether constituting cognitive 
processes, thus leading to the definition of cognitive institutions as institu­
tions "without which some of the agents' cognitive processes would not exist 
or even be possible" (Petracca & Gallagher, 2020, p. 747).
The legal system has been a favorite example in this respect. It consists of 
a set of structures and practices that include normatively defined cognitive 
practices. When we engage with the legal system (that is, when we interact 
with, or are coupled to it in the right way), it extends our cognitive processes 
and helps us to solve problems of a particular type.
Contracts, for example, embody conceptual schemas that contribute to and shape 
some of our cognitive practices. They are themselves products of specific cognitive 
exercises, but they are also used as tools to accomplish certain aims, to reinforce 
certain behaviors, and to solve certain problems. Institutions of property, contract, 
rights, and law, and the precise way that we use them, not only constrain our thinking 
about social arrangements, and about acceptable behavior, they allow us to think in 
ways that would not be possible without such institutions.              
(Gallagher 2018, p. 434; see Gallagher & Crisafi, 2009; Gallagher, 20132018).
Contracts not only play a role in legal contexts, but are economic instru­
ments. Gallagher et al. (2019) and Petracca & Gallagher (2020) have also 
argued that markets are cognitive institutions. A market is a social institu­
tion, and it emerges as such because it involves intersubjective interactions 
embedded in social and cultural practices that constrain and enable eco­
nomic agents' behavior. The constraints imposed by market interactions, as 
220
S. GALLAGHER AND E. PETRACCA

well as the possibilities enabled by such interactions, suggest that economic 
reasoning is not just an individual process characterized by autonomous 
decision making, as it is classically understood. Considering the perspective 
of the agents involved, the market as cognitive institution includes Clark's 
notion of scaffolded cognition, (i) extending/supporting the participant's 
cognitive processes of economic reasoning, and (ii) both constraining and 
enabling the actions and interactions of embodied and embedded agents in 
the economy. These processes could easily be modeled on functional 
equivalence (first wave) and integration (second wave).
Two further characteristics of SEM-style cognitive institutions, however, 
add some complexity to the notion of institution. First, that institutions 
emerge from intersubjective interactions. They not only constrain/enable 
social interaction, but they are built upon (constituted by) social interac­
tions. If one takes away social interactions, then the legal system, markets, 
educational institutions, science, etc., and the cognitive processes they make 
possible no longer exist. If this seems obvious, its importance is tied to the 
way that we understand the nature of intersubjective interaction. This is not 
something we will explore here (see Gallagher, 2020), except as it relates to 
the issue of trust (in the next section). Second, as clarified by Marc Slors 
(2019), SEM/cognitive institutions can be differentiated from an extended- 
mind conception of institution as a causal-functional unit. In contrast to 
a conception of functional equivalence or functional integration, where the 
cognitive process may be internal or external or some combination of 
internal and external information processing, the concept of a SEM institu­
tion incorporates an enactive perspective, according to which cognition is 
constituted in a specific form of dynamical engagement with the world (Di 
Paolo & Thompson, 2014; Gallagher, 2017; Kirchhoff, 2012; Stewart et al., 
2010; Varela et al., 1991). Slors thus contrasts the functionalist view intrinsic 
to Clark's concept of institution, with what he calls "symbiotic" processes 
involved with SEM institutions. Slors (2019) defines the notion of symbiotic 
cognition in terms of "task dependency".
"Task dependency" is the extent to which the intelligibility of a task depends on a larger 
whole of coordinated tasks. Task dependency is a notion that is connected with coordi­
nation and planning. It is a normative notion in the sense that high task dependency 
means that tasks play specific roles in the overall organization of a cognitive system or 
a cultural cognitive ecosystem; roles that can be played properly or improperly.                                                           
(p. 1190)
Slors cites the legal system as a good example of high task dependency: 
judge, prosecutor, defense attorney, clerk, and other court officials are 
responsible for tasks organized (and inter-defined) in a holistic way. In 
other words, for example, what a defense attorney does is understandable 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
221

only by referring to what judges and prosecutors do. This indicates 
a division of labor in a symbiotic system.
Division of labor involves a specific type of offloading, one which is typical for 
symbiotic cognition but not for extended [mind]. Every participant in a symbiotic 
system profits from whatever the system as a whole offers (education, justice, social 
coordination) while contributing only a small part. The tasks, jobs and roles of others 
in the system co-define and enable one's own task.                                                                                                    
(p. 1198).
Both the role of intersubjective interaction and task dependence (and the 
implied division of labor) hold some implications for how we think about 
trust or reliance in cognitive institutions in ways that differ from the 
extended-mind conception of scaffolding institution.
3. Trust vs. reliability in institutional theory
Questions about trust in the case of extended-mind institutions are tied to 
the idea that the primary function of institutions can be framed in terms of 
information processing (e.g., Hayek, 1945), whether that happens in 
a functionally equivalent manner or in terms of a more complex functional 
integration. In this respect, an institution is treated as a resource that 
provides or processes information as a precondition for pursuing whatever 
other institutional function may be at stake (Hindriks & Guala, 2021). We 
might then ask, how much trust should we put in such resources. There is 
already a good answer to this question in the EM literature. Clark and 
Chalmers (1998) had already defined a set of criteria, as a supplement to 
the parity principle, that became known as the "trust and glue" criteria. 
These criteria are meant to head off the "cognitive bloat" objection, which is 
a worry about how far the mind can be extended - does it include all of the 
resources of the internet, for example? (Rupert, 2004). The answer is that we 
should include only those resources as part of extended cognition that meet 
the parity principle and these three criteria. They are clearly stated in Clark 
(2008).
(1) That the external resource be reliably available and typically invoked. 
[. . .]
(2) That any information thus retrieved be more-or-less automatically 
endorsed. It should not usually be subject to critical scrutiny (unlike 
the opinions of other people, for example). It should be deemed about 
as trustworthy as something retrieved clearly from biological memory.
(3) That information contained in the resource should be easily acces­
sible as and when required. (p. 79)
222
S. GALLAGHER AND E. PETRACCA

Although second-wave EM questions the parity principle, it generally 
accepts these criteria of reliability, trustworthiness, and accessibility (see 
Aizawa, 2018). The third wave, SEM model, however, tends to reject these 
criteria as overly narrow.1 This becomes evident as soon as we try to apply 
these criteria to the institutional domain. When Clark says "[i]nstitutions, 
firms, and organizations seem to me to share many of the key properties of 
pen, paper, and arithmetical practice (Clark, 1997, p. 279), he seems not to 
consider that institutions would not pass his own three criteria of mind 
extension. For example, the legal system may not be easily accessible for all 
parties, but it can still work when one does gain access; accordingly, easy 
accessibility should not be a litmus test of cognition. Likewise, it's not clear 
why automatic endorsement is required to qualify a process as part of 
extended cognition since critical scrutiny (which may actually involve the 
opinions of others) itself qualifies as cognitive, and indeed may very well add 
a trustworthiness or reliability to my thought processes. Indeed, postulating 
automatic endorsement Clark seems to rule out interaction as an institu­
tional process of trust-making. These considerations suggest that Clark's 
"trust and glue" package is unable to account for trust as a criterion of mind 
extension in circumstances where other agents are involved.
Hawley's (2014) proposal to distinguish between trust and reliability 
works well in this context. Roughly, on her view, we can think that reliability 
applies to impersonal resources - mechanisms or sources of information, 
tools, and instruments, whereas trustworthiness applies to interpersonal 
relations where some form of assurance, responsibility or obligation is 
involved. The "trust and glue" criteria say nothing about assurance, respon­
sibility or obligation. We suggest that these criteria are all about reliability - 
they aim to test the dependability and availability of resources and the 
information they convey. Indeed, to the extent that this information could 
include "the opinions of other people" we have reason to discount it since 
such opinions would require critical scrutiny. Perhaps that would indicate 
some degree of distrust of that source of information, although whether this 
is distrust or simply a judgment of unreliability will depend on the nature of 
the relation one has with that other person (see below). These criteria, then, 
suggest that resources such as institutions, including economic institutions, 
operating as information sources, may be treated as one might treat what 
Hawley (2017) views as group epistemic testimony - group testimony can 
have epistemic significance, without entailing group assurance, responsibil­
ity or trustworthiness. Trustworthiness, however, becomes an issue in the 
case of individual epistemic testimony.
The case is different for cognitive institutions understood on the SEM 
model, specifically because intersubjective interaction and task dependency 
play essential roles both in the formation and the operation of such institu­
tions (Slors, 2019; see above). They operate as sites of social and cultural 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
223

practices with normative expectations and constraints that involve respon­
sibility for carrying out tasks. The model of engagement or coupling here is 
action and interaction rather than just testimony. Operative members of an 
institution conduct the affairs of the institution at least in part by means of 
interpersonal interaction or communication. Operative members are those 
members who are responsible for decision making, determined by the 
structure (formal or informal rules/norms) of the institution (Tollefsen, 
2004; Tuomela, 1995). As individuals or as a collective, operative members 
engage with or engage in the operations of the institution by engaging, 
directly or indirectly with others. The institution functions only through 
social interactions constrained by normative, task-related factors.
In the example of the legal system, even mulling over contracts, or 
attempting to come to a judgment based on evidence, involves the work 
of others who are responsible, and who attest to following the proper legal 
procedures. Even more clearly, in legal proceedings that involve judges, 
jurors, attorneys, etc., the interactions come with specifications of tasks and 
responsibilities for carrying out those tasks. Understood as cognitive insti­
tutions, science (Slaby & Gallagher, 2015), educational institutions, corpora­
tions, markets, etc. work in a broadly similar fashion.
It's important to recognize that the operation of the cognitive institution 
is not simply a case of the action of an individual writ large. Hawley (2017) 
suggests that trustworthiness is tied to the idea that the individual has 
a certain autonomy. "Regarding an individual as trustworthy is typically 
caught up with respect for her as autonomous in some way: someone who 
reliably follows a benevolent despot's orders under duress is not displaying 
her trustworthiness. Trustworthy behavior often, though not always, reflects 
a determination to fulfil obligations or commitments which were voluntarily 
acquired" (p. 246). She then asks:
Do we need to regard groups and organizations in the same way? It may depend upon 
the group, its constitution and supposed purpose, including questions about whether 
an organization is an element of the state or a private entity, and whether membership 
of a particular group is chosen or imposed. To what extent do certain groups have 
obligations to individuals, or to other groups? As these considerations indicate, issues 
of trustworthiness in group action quickly involve larger questions about collective 
responsibility and commitment; a fruitful line of inquiry would be to investigate 
whether or not these questions can be sidestepped by thinking in terms of reliability 
rather than trustworthiness.                                                                                                                 
(p. 246)
Individuals within the context of cognitive institutions may indeed have 
a kind of autonomy (perhaps best thought of as "relational autonomy," that 
is, a form of autonomy that is either enabled or constrained by social and 
normative factors - see Cash, 2013; Mackenzie & Stoljar, 2000). With 
respect to the functioning of the cognitive institution, it is their responsible 
224
S. GALLAGHER AND E. PETRACCA

action or work within a task-related framework that counts. The judge must 
do her work according to the law; the scientist works according to scientific 
procedure; in market relations, individuals or collectives follow the shared 
rules that define them as buyers, sellers, producers, consumers, etc. These 
laws, rules and procedures specify interdependent task responsibilities. 
In such contexts, trustworthiness is not simply directed to the individual, 
but also to the role they are playing. We trust that the judge is capable, 
not only of autonomous behavior, but of making a legal ruling following 
proper procedure. Indeed, this trust is in addition to any concern about 
reliability, which may itself qualify or undermine the trustworthiness of 
the judge who is herself subject to the limitations of her bodily engage­
ment. We may find both the judge and the system unreliable if the judge 
has not eaten a proper breakfast, and that's different from finding them 
untrustworthy. A recent study reinforces the idea that hunger can shape, 
and perhaps even distort, cognitive processes. Danziger et al. (2011) 
show that whether the judge is hungry or satiated may play an important 
role in the rational application of legal reasoning (the percentage of 
favorable rulings drops significantly between breakfast and lunch and 
returns abruptly after a [food] break). In such cases, the judge may be 
entirely trustworthy in terms of her intentions to fulfill her legal respon­
sibilities; but she may be entirely unreliable simply because of her meta­
bolic state.
Consider another example more directly relevant to markets. The 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) imposed a large fine on 
the Boeing company and its CEO for "putting profits over people" and 
misleading investors with the aim of improving its image. We know that 
in the case of the 737 Max aircraft, the Boeing manufacturing process was 
seriously unreliable, leading to two air disasters and the loss of hundreds 
of lives. According to Gary Gensler, chairman of SEC, "[i]n times of crisis 
and tragedy, it is especially important that public companies and execu­
tives provide full, fair, and truthful disclosures to the markets."2 Boeing 
failed in this regard too. Its reputation was severely damaged by its 
attempt to cover up a major design problem, and it lost public and 
investor trust. Boeing turned out to be both unreliable and untrust­
worthy, and this case makes it clear that these are two different things.
Reliability and trustworthiness, however, although they can be distin­
guished, are not unrelated. Contingencies connected with reliability can 
undermine the degree of trust we may have for the operations of both 
individuals and the institutions. A similar dynamic is at work in markets 
where a lack of reliability or trust can introduce inefficiencies and costs, or 
put the brakes on collaborative enterprise.

Just as institutions do not regulate all possible contingencies, so knowledge of another 
person can never be so perfect that her decisions can be anticipated with certainty. Also for 
the calculation of the intentions of the exchange partner it holds true that, even with all 
attempts at calculation, a final doubt cannot be removed. Despite social norms, a harmful 
violation of the norms by the trust-giver always remains on the horizon of possibility. 
Because of the increase of decisions as well as the number of actors involved, time restric­
tions, scarcity of information, and the need to delegate decisions become more urgent 
problems. Especially market relations in modern societies demand that risky advance 
concessions must be made without precise knowledge of the exchange partner, without 
relying on long-term relations, and despite only incomplete observation of his action with 
others, as in situations that are not extensively guaranteed by power or norms. The core of 
the problem of trust consists precisely in this "middle condition between knowing and not- 
knowing" (Simmel), even when institutions, social norms, power and calculations of interest 
contribute to forming expectations.                                                                                                       
(Beckert, 2005, p. 14)
Judgments of reliability may just be a matter of having sufficient informa­
tion about and signals from the source. This may be the kind of shallow 
"trust" one finds in game theory.3 In markets, perceived reliability can be 
externalized "to interfaces and related protocols among them in their 
niche to reduce costs of communication" or to signs or signals (David 
et al., 2021, p. 51). We could think of these as a kind of automatic stand-in 
for trust. "For example, traffic signals allow drivers to externalize their 
trust to signals which inform the projection of other drivers's behavior, as 
opposed to being left to develop trust with other drivers in order to share 
the road" (David et al., 2021, p. 51). Likewise in institutions, trust can be 
externalized to organizational arrangements that are reliable indicators of 
behavior (a contract, for example, may serve as a barrier to withdrawal 
[Beckert, 2005]).
Trust may operate in some deeper sense, with respect to the individual, 
correlative to the psychological complexity of the resource; it has to 
penetrate to the realm of motives, and to considerations that despite 
well-meaning advice, the other may in fact not know that a particular 
action or decision is the wrong one. This deeper, interpersonal trust, has 
its roots in what Matthew Ratcliffe (2017, p. 150) calls a "primitive, 
affective, nonconceptual form of trust," which "develops within, and is 
then sustained by, the interpersonal environment."4 With respect to the 
institution, interpersonal trust may be correlative to the organizational 
complexity of the resource and an understanding of how the system 
works. One would need an endorsement of not only the reliability of 
the resource, but the honesty of the resource, based on prior experience 
with it, or perhaps the testimony of others whom one trusts, where such 
trust involves the same kind of dialectic with reliability.

4. Trust and reliability in markets
Adam Smith's famous passage on self-interest as market mover has some­
thing to do with the trust/reliability distinction.
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect 
our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to 
their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but 
of their advantages.                                                                                              
(Smith, 1976a, I.ii.2)
Smith can here be understood as saying that to provide for our needs we do 
not need to trust in whatever sentiment the butcher, the brewer, or the baker 
may have toward us; rather, we should rely on their self-interest. The mere 
expectation that those market agents would do what their roles dictate them 
to do is not enough for considering them recipients of our trust - that is, it 
would be inaccurate, even paradoxical, to say that we trust in their self- 
interest. It takes Smith's strictly complementary work as a moral philoso­
pher focusing on people's mutual "sympathy" (Smith, 1976b) to acknowl­
edge that also the proper, relational notion of trust, as economists have 
recently come to recognize, "is an economic primitive" (Berg et al., 1995, 
p. 123). It is important to note that Smith's discussion took place at the end 
of a historical period where markets were such a central part of the economy 
that the economic organization itself was called a "market economy," but it 
was not yet, as Fernand Braudel (1977) pointed out, a capitalist system. The 
advent of capitalism brought about structural changes in markets able to 
transform the notions of trust and reliance themselves. If Smith was still able 
to see trust and reliance (or lack thereof) as primarily relational constructs 
involving strong symbiotic relationships between agents recognized as the 
butcher, the brewer, and the baker, this would soon not be entirely the case.5
Growth in market size, the concentration of market actors, the rise of all 
sorts of intermediaries, and dematerialization, are just some of the phenom­
ena that make Hawley's distinction between trust and reliance increasingly 
crucial for understanding contemporary markets. When we today say that 
we trust or don't trust the market to take care of one or another part of our 
lives, we almost invariably mean, not that we trust or distrust market actors, 
but that we find the market mechanism reliable or not reliable. This goes 
well beyond the issue, by itself not trivial, of distinguishing between indivi­
dual and collective actors as recipients of trust6: it concerns the distinction 
between actors and instruments itself. Discussing the nature of trust-takers, 
Beckert (2005), much in agreement with what Hawley would later say, 
indicates that
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
227

Trust is a social expectation which means that trust always refers to another person or 
a corporate actor. I can trust my friends, my business partners, my bank, but not my 
bike or the safety of a railing.                                                                                                                   
(p. 7).
The point is that a market mechanism has much more to do with the safety 
of a railing than with a friend. Mechanism and railing are both designed to 
accomplish something. They are, as such, quintessential recipients of reli­
ance, not trust. In this scenario, trust enters into play at best "at access points 
where the nexus of system and person takes place" (Beckert, 2005, p. 19). It 
would be hard to overemphasize the centrality of market design (or 
mechanism design) today in both economics and the economy (Roth, 
2008). The more a certain market is considered to be critical, the more it 
is painstakingly engineered to reach specific goals, among which efficiency 
usually comes first.7 In brief, market mechanisms are designed and 
employed as reliable instruments of efficiency.8 Such a view of markets is 
part of a more general approach to institutions called "institutional design" 
(e.g., Goodin, 1998), which sees institutions as entities given "from above" 
in a top-down fashion (Smith, 2007).
This discussion of market design has much to do with the extended mind 
foundations of institutions and the idea of trust they support. Not only does 
Clark (1997, 1998) present markets as pivotal examples of scaffolding 
institutions, but his way to institutional scaffolding seems to require markets 
to be the kind of entities given from above as objects of market design. He 
mentions in this regard the work of Gode and Sunder (1993) showing that 
certain market rules can lead to efficiency even in the case of unsophisticated 
cognitive agents called "zero-intelligence" traders. This kind of research 
seems to dovetail perfectly with Clark's idea that mind extension occurs 
when individuals off-load or "externalize" (a term with similar economic 
and philosophy of mind implications) their cognition onto external 
resources, in this case the market mechanism. Clark shifts the focus of 
market scaffolding from individuals to market mechanisms in a way that, 
as it is usually said in the economic literature, "[s]tructural constraints, not 
individuals, do much of the explanatory work" (Hodgson, 2004, p. 438). 
When discussing markets, Clark (1998) vividly conveys the idea that the 
intelligence of individuals is traded for the intelligence of the designed 
system:
we [humans] excel in one crucial respect: we are masters at structuring our physical 
and social worlds so as to press complex coherent behaviors from these unruly 
resources. We use intelligence to structure our environment so that we can succeed 
with less intelligence. Our brains make the world smart so that we can be dumb in 
peace!                                                                                                                 
(p. 180)
228
S. GALLAGHER AND E. PETRACCA

As this approach to institutional mind extension does not directly concern 
other agents, zero-intelligence seems to have "zero-trust" as a corollary; 
since these agents' have only a fiduciary relationship with a mechanism, they 
are rather "maximum-reliability" agents.
Although this is the most common way markets are understood today, an 
alternative approach called the "relational paradigm" emphasizes interperso­
nal relationships in markets (Bowles, 2016; Bruni & Zamagni, 2017; see also 
Sugden, 2018). Although not usually framed in terms of extended cognition, 
this approach can lead us toward a third-wave understanding of economic 
institutions and trust. To do this, consider first the limits that the relational 
paradigm identifies in the mechanism-focused understanding of markets. 
The idea of a "relational good" introduced by Carole Uhlaner (1989) can 
be useful in this regard. The traditional approach to economic transactions 
would be unable to address, Uhlaner says, an entire class of goods which are 
called relational exactly in that they are neither created nor consumed by 
a single person. One example of a relational good is a mattress purchased in 
the nearby mattress shop with the help of a shop assistant, in contrast to one 
ordered online. Another example is going to a service to help prepare your 
taxes; using tax preparation software is not. As these examples show, what is 
called in economic jargon a relational "good" includes in fact an interperso­
nal experience, the sort of value-related phenomena that market mechanisms 
have difficulties accounting for. There are clear third-wave (SEM) elements in 
the definition of a relational good, for instance their co-creational nature, as 
"the adjective relational is intended to specify what these goods are made of, 
not just one of their qualities" (Gui, 2013, p. 296, emphasis in original). There 
is also a way to extend the concept from a collective but still limited dimen­
sion, usually two or a few people, to entire institutions through concepts such 
as "social capital" which point to an entire society's disposition to engage in 
relational experiences. There are, however, other aspects which make the 
analysis of relational goods too limited from the point of view of the SEM 
model, or third-wave extended mind. Although of course important, the aim 
of catching "what makes personalized different from non-personalized inter­
action" (Gui, 2013, p. 299) is somewhat limited. To see what makes this goal 
limited, consider Julie Nelson's objection to the idea of a relational good from 
a radical viewpoint. She points out that we are "in very large degree con­
stituted by our relationships. [. . .] [W]e are continually created and shaped by 
the encounters in which we participate" (Nelson, quoted in Gui, 2013, p. 300, 
emphasis in original). The idea of a relational good would be problematic if it 
sees interpersonal relations as an important but dispensable category. 
Advocates of relational goods may say that consuming a meal at 
a restaurant with a friend, rather than eating a pre-prepared meal from the 
fridge alone, increases happiness and well-being, but radical theorists like 
Nelson would object that such practices do much more than that: they enact 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
229

a social practice or institution, and they contribute, in a constitutive way, to 
who we are, or, to say it differently, they are part of the physiology of a SEM 
institution. Still another way to put it is to say that lack of interpersonal 
relations would put in jeopardy the very existence of trustworthy sociality. 
Given its importance, the next section will be dedicated to a discussion of this 
point.
5. Institutional physiology: Trust as a criterion of sustainable 
institutions
Nelson's critique of the insufficient radicalism of the relational paradigm 
raises a crucial question: are interpersonal relationships and relational trust 
required for SEM/cognitive institutions in the sense that they are constitu­
tive of such institutions? The emphasis Nelson puts on the "constitutive" 
role of interpersonal relationships suggests that they are. This is a view 
consistent with the enactivist emphasis on social interaction as a constitutive 
process (De Jaegher et al., 2010). As we've seen, however, not all cases of 
institutional mind extension are considered socially extended. Defining 
a cognitive institution as an institution "without which some of the agents' 
cognitive processes would not exist or even be possible" (Petracca & 
Gallagher, 2020, p. 747), Clark could object that designed markets with no 
real interpersonal relationships involved can also create new cognitive 
processes. Dekker (2022) discusses cognitive processes that markets make 
possible, and some of them seem prima facie compatible with either inter­
personal relational or non-relational market structures (see also Callon & 
Muniesa, 2005). We all continuously rely on utterly impersonal mechanisms 
that involve no relational trust but that nonetheless do extend our minds. 
Even if most markets are hybrids of impersonal and interpersonal struc­
tures, involving both functional integrative and symbiotic processes, both 
reliability and trust, there seem to be clear examples of purely impersonal 
market mechanisms running on automatic pilot, and requiring zero- 
intelligence while paradoxically extending individual cognition.
All this is to say that in some common examples of institutional mind 
extension, neither interpersonal relationships nor trust seem necessary; the 
mind-extending coupling between individuals and institutions can some­
times do without them, and be satisfied with reliability. Indeed, some may 
take this possibility to be an advantage, not just in terms of efficiency, but in 
terms of overall moral benefit. After all, any arrangement that entails trust, 
may also result in justified mistrust. The social extension of cognition does 
not always take desirable forms (Gallagher, 2020). Intrusive institutions and 
distorted communicative practices can "colonize" the mind, extending it in 
pathological directions (Castoriadis, 1997). These considerations notwith­
standing, we still think that relational trust is a requirement for institutional 
230
S. GALLAGHER AND E. PETRACCA

mind extension, even as an important part of the impersonal scaffolding 
type. Clark may have a point in saying that designed scaffolding institutions 
can extend the mind - sometimes more systematically and efficiently than 
interpersonal relational SEM institutions - but he says nothing about the 
sustainability of this form of mind extension. In what follows, we argue that 
the lack of both interpersonal relationships and relational trust makes 
institutional mind extension fundamentally unsustainable. Therefore, we 
introduce trust as a dynamic criterion of institutional mind extension more 
generally.
The discussion can start with what makes Clark's approach fundamen­
tally static, his idea that mind extension requires the automatic endorsement 
of external resources (Clark, 2008; see above). Assuming automatic endor­
sement as a criterion, understanding it normatively, as Clark does, means 
ruling out most cases of institutional mind extension that take place via 
interpersonal relationships. The fact that one person rarely (virtually never) 
endorses "automatically" what another person does or says, makes it diffi­
cult for interpersonal relationships to meet Clark's criterion. A consequence 
of this is, therefore, a significant restriction in the cases of institutional mind 
extension. But we do not limit our analysis to the constraining limitation of 
this criterion. Rather, we can follow Clark's logic to the end, accepting the 
requirement of automatic endorsement of institutional resources as 
a criterion of mind extension, if only to see that this is dynamically unsus­
tainable. If Clark's criterion implies or leads to the dispensability of inter­
personal relationships, our unsustainability argument demonstrates that 
such relationships are (dynamically) necessary.
To make our case, that is, to show why Clark's criterion of automatic 
endorsement leads to unsustainability, consider some institutional pathol­
ogies related to the idea of automatically endorsed mechanisms. One of 
them is the reification of relational potential. Reification "means a forgetting 
of the primal recognition that two humans accord each other in 
a fundamental process of intersubjective interactions" (Jay, 2008, p. 8). In 
modern markets, reification is not merely a byproduct of market mechan­
isms but their direct implication, probably even an assumption, i.e., the 
assumption that if they did not produce reification - a price for everything - 
markets would not work as efficiently as they do. But reification cannot be 
considered a neutral feature of markets, insofar as it has important effects, 
such as crowding out intrinsic motivation (Frey, 1994). Another pathologi­
cal effect is counterperformativity (Bamford & MacKenzie, 2018). If reifica­
tion and its effects are generally expected in modern markets, 
counterperformativity includes all the unintended ways in which mechan­
isms may fail or may work differently than expected in changing circum­
stances. Reliability tends to be short term, not only because mechanisms 
sometimes break down, but oftentimes because circumstances (including 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
231

human inclinations) change. In market counterperformativity, the market 
mechanism not only fails but creates the conditions for its own failure: it 
shapes an inflexible reality in which it is bound to fail.
Another pathology is institutional lockout. Even institutions that are 
perfectly designed internally, sometimes just do not work, because they do 
not get integrated into the larger institutional system. A conspicuous exam­
ple is the persistent failure to implement both market-based and state-based 
development policies (Gunn, 1978). Add to this that an institution or 
a policy imposed from above may sometimes generate "reactance" in people 
who feel deprived of their autonomy (Sunstein, 2017).
As the list of pathologies could easily go on, we'll mention just one more 
that is wryly presented by Clark as an advantage: the lack of necessity for 
individual intelligence (a phenomenon not unconnected with the advances 
of AI). It is easy to suspect that a consistent practice of automatic endorse­
ment may cause the atrophy of cognitive capacities rather than the extension 
of those capacities; the high reliability of our technical instruments may 
preempt anything like imaginative cognitive engagement and simply lead to 
cognitive atrophy. Moreover, this would not be restricted to cognitive 
capacities since relational capacities would become atrophic as well. 
Combined this with counterperformativity, and the path clearly leads to 
unsustainable arrangements.
The pathologies listed above stem from a static and impersonal under­
standing of institutional mind extension. They all, individually or together, 
pose a serious threat to the survival of institutions. These issues could be 
addressed, supporters of the relational paradigm advocate, by restoring the 
physiology of interpersonal relationships and relational trust (Bowles, 2016; 
Bruni & Zamagni, 2017; Sugden, 2018). Adam Smith's message that "[w] 
ithout trust there can be no progress" (Evensky, 2011, p. 253) can be read in 
this vein, understanding trust as a condition of institutional continuity.
The 2008 financial crisis is a recent historical example where institutional 
continuity was seriously put at risk. Although the crisis was not the result of 
one particular market pathology but of a nefarious combination of 
pathologies,9 the problems that led to this crisis all had something to do 
with either misplaced reliance on the market mechanism or the erosion of 
relational trust. Discussing the crisis in some detail may help show how 
relational trust at sensitive junctures of the economic system could have 
contributed to mitigating the crisis' spread and its severity. It is widely 
known that much of what happened in 2008 had to do with mortgages: 
they were pooled in securities called asset-based securities (ABSs) which in 
turn became the underlying assets of another type of securities, collatera­
lized debt obligations (CDOs). Serial pooling was supposed to decrease the 
risk of the resulting instruments (called ABS CDOs) and obtain good ratings 
although the quality of underlying mortgages declined as the number of 
232
S. GALLAGHER AND E. PETRACCA

subscriptions increased. In this process, mortgages were detached from their 
genuine economic function (i.e., providing borrowers with the means to buy 
a house) and became mere raw materials for securitization; in a sense, they 
became "reified".10 Brokers' aggressive practices to procure mortgages - 
known as "predatory lending" - eroded relational trust between lenders and 
borrowers in an important transaction in the lives of borrowers (Keys et al., 
2010; Mian & Sufi, 2009). A second pathology related to trust in this context 
was market opacity (or lack of market transparency). Securities like ABSs, 
CDOs - and a fortiori ABS CDOs - are inherently complex financial 
instruments. Their correct evaluation requires investors to be able not 
only to appreciate the instruments' structure but also the quality of the 
underlying assets, a process that can take an excruciatingly long time. It was 
not uncommon at the dawn of the crisis to hear that full transparency would 
reduce the liquidity (number of exchanges) of securities markets (e.g., 
Madhavan et al., 2005). Evaluation of ABS CDOs was thus institutionally 
delegated to rating agencies, which played a central trust-related role in the 
crisis as the ratings they issued de facto had normative value for investment 
institutions. As MacKenzie (2011) shows, high ratings for risky ABS CDOs 
were the result of organizational imbalances within rating agencies in the 
face of a new exotic financial instrument as well as of an inadequate 
evaluation model. The model, Gaussian copula pricing models, is today 
infamously known as "the formula that killed Wall Street" (Salmon, 2009). 
Misplaced reliance on such a pricing mechanism was at the origin of 
a snowballing counterperformative process that did not necessarily imply 
fraud (MacKenzie & Spears, 2014, 2014b). Again, relational trust could have 
played a mitigating role had better communicative and interactional pro­
cesses been possible, allowing dissenting voices about the unreliability of the 
pricing mechanism to be heard within the financial community (e.g., Taleb, 
2007). Eventually, misplaced reliance and lack of relational trust at so many 
levels of the financial crisis caused generalized distrust of markets and other 
economic institutions (Stevenson & Wolfers, 2011).
Although it has little to do with markets, the timely example of 
vaccination campaigns can be useful to illustrate the role of interpersonal 
relationships and relational trust in creating institutional cohesion as 
a sort of institutional glue. It is well known that part of the population 
has been reluctant to take vaccines, and various experiments have shown 
that traditional communication from government or regulatory autho­
rities has no effect, or even negative effects in promoting vaccinations 
(e.g., Betsch & Sachse, 2013). It has been shown, however, that small- 
group discussions with experts can have a real impact.
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
233

When people encounter a message that aims at changing their minds, they typically generate 
counter-arguments [. . .]. If they do not have an interlocutor who can address these counter- 
arguments (e.g., if they read a leaflet), they are less likely to change their minds. This likely 
explains why small-group discussion, in which counter-arguments can be addressed in the 
back and forth of discussion, is vastly more effective at changing people's minds than the 
simple presentation of arguments. [. . .] In line with this, direct communication with 
trustworthy professionals appears to be an efficient lever to increase vaccination acceptance.                                  
(Altay et al., 2021, p. 2)
Although there are understandable concerns about the scalability of small- 
group discussions, recent evidence by Altay et al. (2021) that a chatbot can 
change people's attitudes toward vaccines could motivate the sort of critical 
questions we raised about Clark's approach: is such an approach sustain­
able? Is it possible to replace trust in interpersonal relationships with 
reliance on impersonal mechanisms without paying a price in terms of 
institutional cohesion and sustainability?
6. Concluding remarks
In considering the importance of trust, we've focused on economic institu­
tions, and specifically questions about market mechanisms and the role of 
social interactions. It's been acknowledged that some recent advances in 
institutional economics are closely tied to developments in philosophy of 
mind and cognitive science, roughly, developments that concern extended 
and enactive cognition (Markey-Towler, 2017; Petracca & Gallagher, 2020). 
We've argued that the analysis of different conceptions of institutional mind 
extension, based on Denzau and North's shared mental models, Clark's 
extended mind, and a more enactive approach that emphasizes the impor­
tance of social interaction and personal relationships in SEM institutions, 
can benefit from Kathrine Hawley's distinction between reliability and trust. 
Institutional arrangements based solely on the reliability of impersonal 
mechanisms, we argued, can lead to a variety of social pathologies and, at 
the extreme, a form of cognitive atrophy, all of which can undermine the 
sustainability of institutions. Even if trust comes with risks and some degree 
of unpredictability, it turns out to be a necessary glue-like ingredient in the 
constitution of social institutions.
Notes
1. For that reason the concept of SEM institution is sometimes thought to succumb to 
cognitive bloat. There are other ways to answer this worry, however. Specifically, the 
SEM model suggests that resources can be treated as processes of extended cognition 
only when there is a proper coupling or engagement with them. If I am not engaged 
with some part of the legal system, mulling over a contract, or arguing before the 
bench, for example, that system, or that part of the system, is not part of my extended 
234
S. GALLAGHER AND E. PETRACCA

cognition; if I am not actually using a search engine, then the internet is not part of my 
cognitive system. This retort to cognitive bloat works well if one considers extended 
mind to depend on active engagement.

3. As Beckert (2005) puts it, "the modeling of trust games based on game theory is 
theoretically problematic for assuming the possibility of rational interpretation of 
signals. They do not do justice to the fundamental uncertainty of the trust-giver, 
which also composes the core of any meaningful talk of trust" (p. 18).
4. "Trust, in the relevant sense, is something that first arises in infancy. It is a bodily, 
affective set of interpersonal expectations, which develop through patterned interac­
tions with caregivers and later come to regulate encounters with people more gen­
erally. The developmental process and the effects of deviation from it are described by 
Fonagy and Allison (2014). They maintain that secure attachments in early life foster 
a sense of trust in others that later generalizes, disposing one to accept credible 
communications, while also instilling confidence in one's own judgments and abilities 
(something that relies on feedback from others) . . . . Fonagy and Allison (2014, 
p. 374) add that attachment insecurity in adults is associated with epistemic biases 
that include intolerance of ambiguity, inflexible and dogmatic thinking, and 
a tendency to make judgments based on insufficient information" (Ratcliffe, 2017, 
p. 161). As we will discuss, for some social theorists this interpersonal kind of trust 
just is what trust means.
5. Smith, however, does not restrict trust and reliance to the interpersonal sphere. When 
he refers to recipients of trust, he often refers to collective entities, such as the 
government, or to less directly agentive entities, such as the law. In Smith's reasoning 
there seems to be nonetheless a principle of discrimination. Consider Smith's example 
of Hamburg (Evensky, 2011; Smith, 1976a, V.ii.f.10;), "a small republick" where 
people are said to pay their taxes "with great fidelity" because they "have entire 
confidence in their magistrates" (note here the symbiotic reference to magistrates 
and not to the government). Trust in collective entities seems to boil down to strict 
relational trust when the involved number of relationships is small.
6. Trust toward collective agents is called "institutional trust". In certain circumstances, but 
not always, it can be considered as a form of relational trust (Bachmann & Inkpen, 2011).
7. The worldly success of market design is especially the merit of auction theory, 
famously used since the 1990s by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) 
to allocate the frequencies of the radio spectrum.
8. Among other goals of market design are equity and stability.
9. Both narrative and quantitative reconstructions agree that the crisis was the result of 
a combination of circumstances rather than of a single major cause (e.g., Rose & 
Spiegel, 2012).
10. It must be stressed that the problem is not securitization per se (as it is a useful 
practice for funding lending), but how the genuine economic function of the practice 
can be distorted.
