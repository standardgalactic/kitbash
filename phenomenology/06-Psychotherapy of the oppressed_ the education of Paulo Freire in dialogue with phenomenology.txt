ABSTRACT
The current paradigm of mental health has fallen short in its 
promises to deliver better care and quality of life for those 
who lives with mental illness. Recent works have expressed 
the need for more comprehensive frameworks of research, in 
which phenomenology emerges as a fundamental tool for 
a new wave interdisciplinary studies with the humanities. In 
line with this project, this article hopes to explore the relation 
between education and phenomenologically oriented psy­
chotherapy, through the work of Brazilian educator Paulo 
Freire. First, we will briefly expose Freire's biography and 
main ideas (such as the "banking model of education" and 
the creation of "culture circles"), showing how they can be 
useful during the clinical encounter. We will also highlight 
the importance of dialogical psychotherapy during situations 
of injustice and oppression. Finally, we will provide some 
insights that can help build a new paradigm of mental health 
that is based on a "praxis of freedom", whether in research or 
clinical practice. We call this proposal a "Psychotherapy of the 
Oppressed".

1. Introduction
It's a common understanding that the current paradigm of mental health 
has come to a point of inflexion (Lancet Psychiatry & the Lancet Psychiatry,  
2022). By 2023, nearly one billion people are expected to live with a mental 
disorder, especially with the outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic, affect­
ing mostly women and young people in situations of vulnerabilities and 
poverty (WHO, 2022). Despite decades of funding and research, the field 
has not shown significant results in reducing both prevalence and incidence 
of diseases, while people with mental disorders still live with higher burden 
of disease and worse quality of life (Barry, 2022).
Like the early 20th century pioneers, we also find ourselves in a period of 
stagnation of neurobiological models, searching for a theoretical framework

that allows access to subjective experiences without reduction or oversim­
plification. In this sense, phenomenological psychopathology arises as 
a fundamental tool for a new paradigm of mental health (G. Messas & 
Fulford, 2021; Lancet Psychiatry & The Lancet Psychiatry, 2021). Over the 
last decade, we have seen phenomenology draws from a strict psychopatho­
logical point of view toward a new wave of interdisciplinary studies. 
Moreover, phenomenological psychopathology emerges as a translational 
resource that can integrate research and clinical practice, providing more 
precise terms for describing lived experiences and increasing reliability for 
mental disorders (Larsen et al., 2022; Ritunnano et al., 2023).
At the same time, the scientific community has been interested in refram­
ing the theoretical and ethical grounds of psychiatry and psychology, calling 
out for more pluralistic and comprehensive frameworks of research while 
maintaining psychopathology at its core (Stanghellini & Broome, 2014; Stein 
et al., 2022). Recently, philosophers of psychiatry have outlined the impor­
tance of recognizing the vulnerabilities, prejudices, and epistemic injustices 
that happens during the clinical encounter (Kidd et al., 2022; Ritunnano, 2022; 
L. Spencer, 2021; L. J. Spencer, 2023). This includes situations of stigma from 
people with dementia (Houlders et al., 2021), neurodiversity (Chapman & 
Carel, 2022), and personality disorders (Kyratsous & Sanati, 2017), and can be 
expanded to many other situations of mental health.
The problem is even more worrying in low- and middle-income countries 
and with non-WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich, and demo­
cratic) populations, such as migrants, where structural injustices (including 
lack of material resources and stigma) are embedded within larger cultural 
and epistemological contexts of racism, sexism, and colonialism (Crichton 
et al., 2017; Russo & Jovanovic, 2022).
For this, the construction of a new paradigm must not only be 
scientific oriented but built around humanistic values, which can be 
improved by incorporating elements of values-based practice and person- 
centered care (K. Fulford, 2017; G. Messas & K. Fulford, 2021). Those 
findings, however, are not easily transposable to clinical practice. Despite 
many efforts, phenomenological psychopathology has been mostly an 
interpretative endeavor, whose main objective is to explicit elements of 
lived experience that are usually hidden or ignored in daily background 
(K. W. M. Fulford et al., 2022). While the person-centered stance of these 
research keeps track of the social dimension of experiences of mental 
suffering and recovery, new initiatives departing from humanities may 
bridge many gaps in mental health service delivery. The challenge is to 
put those insights into practice, leaving from an interpretative stance to 
a transformative one.
One important field that seems yet to be fully explored is the 
association between mental health and education. The role of the 
190

teacher is not so different from the therapist or even the philosopher. 
Western idea of pedagogy1 traces back from the Socratic dialogs and, 
since early 20th century, it aims not only on the acquisition of 
a determined set of skills but on the realization of one's full potential 
(Dewey, 1916). It is impossible to diverge education from dialogue - 
and the same must be true for psychotherapy. Dialogue is in the core 
not only of psychopathology but in our definition of human as 
intersubjective beings (Stanghellini, 2016). In this sense, both educa­
tion and psychotherapy work as a window toward one's worldviews, 
aimed at creating - together teacher/student or clinician/patient - 
a new, shared, and critical view.
This brings us to the work of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, 
a fundamental figure in the critical pedagogy movement and consid­
ered the patron of Brazilian education. Freire was mostly concerned 
with the way education is used as a tool for maintenance of power 
and injustice, where teacher and student are unconscious of their role 
in a system of oppression. In his masterpiece "Pedagogy of the 
Oppressed", Freire advocated for an education that, based on dialo­
gue, could be liberating for both parts, overcoming a situation of 
injustice and oppression (Freire, 2005, 2022). To Freire, it is only 
through dialogue that a true intersubjective space can be created, 
where people are no longer seen as things or objects, but as real 
subjects of their own history.
In his writings, one may find valuable contributions to the study of 
consciousness in a learning process, as well as pioneers' studies on 
culture and critical theory. While Marx and Hegel's influence on 
Freire is more explicit, he was also deeply related to Sartre and other 
phenomenologists and existentialists. Many have discussed Freire's 
influence on education, psychology and health services, but the litera­
ture relating him to phenomenological psychotherapy is scarcer 
(Grasiele et al., 2018).
In this article, we hope to provide some context for Paulo Freire's ideas 
and intellectual background and show how his ideas (such as the "banking 
model of education" and the creation of "culture circles") can be useful for 
minding the gap between theoretical and applied phenomenology in the 
context of mental health. In fact, we will also show how some of his concepts 
have already been integrated within phenomenological psychopathology 
and values-based practice, to reduce situations of epistemic injustices and 
oppressions. Finally, we will provide some insights that can help build a new 
paradigm of mental health that is based on a "praxis of freedom", whether in 
research or clinical practice (such as methods of co-production or phenom­
enologically 
oriented 
psychotherapies).

2. Paulo Freire and liberational education
2.1. Biography
Paulo Freire was born on 1921 in Recife, Brazil - a big city in Brazilian 
Northeast region, mostly rural and poor at the time (Bentley, 2023; Freire & 
Freire, 2021). Despite graduating from Law School, Freire never acted as an 
attorney and started working on education around middle 1940s. His most 
important contributions happened in early 1960s, when he was part of 
a working group with other academics to work on the alphabetization of 
adults, eventually leading to the creation of the "Paulo Freire's method" of 
popular education.
In a pioneer study, Freire and his crew managed to alphabetize nearly 300 
workers in sugar cane fields in only 45 days, with no more than 40 h of class 
and no pre-based material. This astonishing task brought the attention to 
Brazilian democratic president João Goulart, which assigned him to repli­
cate this method throughout the country, in a larger state plan for alphabe­
tization. It is worth noting that, at the time, the participation in Brazilian 
elections was restricted to literate people, which made his work 
a fundamental tool on democracy and political transformation (Westin, 
2016).2
In 1964, however, Brazil suffered a coup d'etat, which removed Goulart's 
presidency and replaced it with a right-wing military govern. Considering 
his socialist inclinations, Freire was arrested for 72 days and further exiled in 
Chile, where he continued his works and writings (Haddad, 2019). With the 
beginning of the long process that ended the military dictatorship, Paulo 
Freire returned to Brazil in 1979 and helped found Brazilian's Workers 
Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores, or PT) once democratic regime was 
restored. Until the end of his life, Freire continued to think about emanci­
patory forms of education, while working close to politicians to create new 
structures for alphabetization (Gadotti, 2021).
Freire died in 1997 at 75 years old, already considered at the time one of 
the most important thinkers of the 20th century, with accolades and titles 
from all over the world. His influence can be seen in educators, philoso­
phers, and human rights activists such as bell hooks, Ira Shor and Steven 
Biko (Hooks, 1994; Sampaio & Guedes, 2021; Silveira, 2021).
2.2. Pedagogy of the oppressed
"Pedagogy of the Oppressed", Paulo Freire's masterpiece, was released 
in 1968 originally in Spanish. Due to censorship, the book was only 
published in Brazil nearly 5 years later and has since been translated in 
more than 20 languages. By 2016, it was the 3rd most-cited publication 
in social sciences according to the Google Scholar platform, ranking it 
192
V. L. PIEDADE AND G. MESSAS

higher than fundamental works of authors such as Michel Foucault, 
John Rawls and Karl Marx (Green, 2016). Since then, it has been cited 
over six thousand times per year, most of them in Portuguese or 
English.3
In this long essay, Freire discusses how traditional model of education 
reiterates social injustices and class exploitation, instead of providing a true 
liberation of the individual. He called traditional pedagogy, represented by 
purely expositive classes, "banking model of education", due to its closeness 
to the act of saving money in a vessel or piggy bank. In this model, the 
transmission of knowledge becomes a donation from the teacher, leaving no 
room for critical thinking, autonomy, and authenticity on the part of the 
student. In that regard:
Education thus becomes an act of depositing, in which the students are the depositories 
and the teacher the depositor. The teacher issues communiqués and makes deposits 
which the students patiently receive, memorize, and repeat. (Freire, 2005, p. 72)
As the student never has the chance to critically analyze his condition, only 
to assimilate what is already given, he does not acquire the necessary tools 
for changing his world. For him, the world becomes something ecstatic, 
motionless. The result is the perpetuation of oppression, in which he 
introjects the shadow of the oppressor, becoming an oppressor himself 
once the transmission of knowledge has taken place (Freire, 2005, p. 46). 
Freire then quotes Simone de Beauvoir, stating that this model aims to 
transform the consciousness of the oppressed, not the situation which 
oppresses them (Freire, 2005, p. 74).
As described in phenomenology, consciousness is never preoccupied 
with itself, but has a characteristic of intentionality; as put by Zahavi 
(2018), "consciousness has a directedness to it, is a consciousness of some­
thing". In a similar fashion, Freire also acknowledges intentionality as 
a necessary means for an immersion in the world, so that knowledge must 
be found outside one own's limits in intersubjectivity. For him, every pre­
scription is the imposition of a consciousness into another and it is funda­
mental for the educator to respect this condition (Freire, 2005, p. 47).
Also, this intersubjective coexistence makes Freire deny both subjecti­
vism (men without world) and objectivism (world without men) (Freire,  
2005, p. 50).4 In this sense, men only exist with each other, and it is this way 
that education should take place. In his words:
People teach each other, mediated by the world (Freire, 2005, p. 80).
Freire advocates for a "liberational model" of education, where the student 
is no longer treated as a repository of information, but an actual agent and 
subject of its own history. This pedagogy is built with the student, not for the 
student, through dialogue and collective construction of an educational 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY

program. The objective now is to provide critical thinking about one's 
world, rather than uncritically acquiring a set of skills, by expanding con­
sciousness toward the hidden, inner aspects of life.
This program is constructed from a concrete existential situation lived by 
the person, not some abstract situation chosen arbitrarily from the teacher's 
experience or worldview. This requires education to be some form of praxis, 
where action and reflection takes place simultaneously, without commit­
ments (Freire, 2005, p. 87).5 Education is then a "praxis of freedom": 
a humanistic endeavor that seeks to liberate both teacher and professor, 
oppressor and oppressed toward being-more (in Portuguese, ser-mais). For:
Ninguém liberta ninguém, ninguém se liberta sozinho: os homens se libertam em 
comunhão [No one frees anyone, no one frees themselves alone: men free themselves 
in communion] (Freire, 2022, p. 71 my translation).
2.3. Freire's methodology
Freire's ideas were put into practice in the so-called research itineraries. As 
previously discussed, this method is a praxis, where action and reflection 
take place simultaneously in a field context, with direct participation of 
students in the construction of the program.
The first step is called "thematic investigation" and starts with the con­
stitution of culture circles: a working space where people bounded by 
a specific social condition gather to discuss their life. These circles are 
dynamic places for transmission of knowledge from the stakeholders and 
are open for all population, valuing local history and culture. In this space, 
participants will discuss their reality, while the researcher pays attention for 
their vocabular universe and ways of communicating with each other, 
taking notes and pictures whenever needed.
The aim of this step is to capture the generative themes: themes that will 
trigger discussion and critical reflection in learning process. These themes 
are usually hidden under limit-situations: deep contradictions of life that 
acts as frontiers to the development of a person. When these situations 
remain hidden or elusive, one can only grasp reality peripherally - for 
instance, alcoholism is only a peripherical phenomenon of larger socio­
economic problems. Only the acknowledgment of limit-situations allows 
consciousness to apprehend reality in its entirety. For Freire, underdevelop­
ment was the ultimate limit-situation that embedded people from the third 
world (Freire, 2005, p. 103).
The following step is the process of coding and decoding, where the 
generative themes will be discussed by the culture circles in their senses, 
meanings, and contexts. The researcher will transform the themes into 
codes (such as pictures, drawings, etc.) that must represent reality in simple 
194
V. L. PIEDADE AND G. MESSAS

terms, not being to explicit or elusive, to reveal the hidden contradictions in 
daily life (i.e., coding). As a result, people start acknowledging the condi­
tions and limit-situations in which they are involved, transforming their 
ecstatic, magical view of reality into a dynamic, critical one with the exter­
iorization of personal and cultural values and worldviews (i.e., decoding).
Finally, we have the unveiling of the world, in which the participants take 
place in transforming their reality through a concrete, political action of 
facing the contractions and limit-situations - creating, therefore, a true 
praxis. The whole itinerary is then reviewed by the participants, along 
with researchers, to be incorporated in further groups, in a larger plan to 
transform the reality of oppression (Freire, 2005, p. 54).
3. Freire and the clinical encounter
Giving most of his preoccupations were with the education of adults, Paulo 
Freire's method is not easily transposable into clinical practice. For obvious 
reasons, the role of the professor is not the same as the one from the 
therapist.6 Yet, his oeuvre seems to have inspired several works that directly 
apply his ideas in health promotion.
In Brazil, for instance, Freire's method has been used in different con­
texts, such as primary care (Antonini & Heideman, 2020; Heidemann et al.,  
2010), prenatal and puerperal care (Fagundes & Oliveira, 2017; Linhares 
et al., 2013), and occupational therapy for people with disabilities (Cerrón 
et al., 2021). More than its methodology, however, there are lessons to be 
learned from his reflection on society and the liberation of people from 
injustice and oppression. In this section, we will show how his ideas can 
serve a basis for a critical analysis of the current paradigm of mental health.
3.1. The "banking model" of therapy
There is a very common, contemporary tendency of a "banking model" of 
therapy. The deposit of knowledge is even more explicit in mental health 
than in education, and it's quite literal in psychopharmacological contexts. 
If the teacher makes announcements for the students to save, with little or 
no interest on their concerns, the psychiatrist hears the patient insofar as it 
contemplates his observations of the patient's behavior and search for 
a diagnosis. Once this process is performed, pills are deposited into one's 
organism, whether to promote remission or alleviate symptoms.
For the clinician, to prescribe a medicament means to store a large 
amount of his knowledge into another's organism: his medical educa­
tion and clinical expertise, and the countless hours of pharmacological 
research, often funded or advertised by pharmaceutical industries. For 
the patient, however, the result is closer to a magical performance, 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
195

where fundamental changes on his lived experience happens without 
his understanding or (in worse case scenarios) his consent. Most of 
the times, the patient is even unable to express these changes, due to 
a lack in his own mean of expression (see hermeneutical injustice 
below).
This must not be understood as a demonization of psychopharmacology. 
Take the case of antidepressants, for instance. Whether or not the mono­
amine deficit hypothesis is implicated in the etiology of depression (Jauhar 
et al., 2023; Moncrieff et al., 2022), antidepressants seems to work, even if 
only as symptomatic relief (Kirsch, 2014). The point is that, whether in 
practice or research, the role of the patient is still undervalue in mental 
health. For him, words such Serotonin or Norepinephrine remain as elusive 
as a mystical explanation for his suffering and provides no real meaning in 
his life. To say that depression is caused by a given biological deficit is to 
establish a world without men - a form of objectivism that neglects the 
intersubjective nature of human being, something contrary to Freire and 
phenomenology itself.
The same can be said about psychotherapy, whatsoever. Despite aiming 
a "talking cure", to put on Freud's terms, for many times psychotherapy is 
not based on dialogue, but on repetition and confirmation. Like the psy­
chiatrist, the therapist maintains his power by refusing to engage in a real 
exchange of knowledge. Rather, he establishes a giver-receiver relation, with 
no room for the patient to actively feel and live his healing process (Grasiele 
et al., 2018), marking the imposition of a consciousness into another. Also, 
the implementation of protocols can be useful for building an evidence- 
based practice, but it must be used wisely, since "one size fits all" approaches 
tend to have negative effects on patients' perceptions of treatment (Fusar- 
Poli et al., 2022).
This tendency of objectification has already been noted by Foucault even 
in contexts of psychoanalysis, where some sort of "endless monologue" is 
performed (Foucault, 1973; L. Spencer & Broome, 2023). Dialogue is not 
a mere conversation or an exchange of information, but an experience 
where a new, unexpected view emerges from two different opinions 
(Stanghellini, 2016). Therefore, dialogue cannot be fully mapped and pre­
dicted. Rather than depositing knowledge, Freire's ideas call for a more 
humanistic, person-centered approach, while maintaining scientific values 
at its core.
3.2. Power structures and epistemic injustices
A close reading of Freire also provides a critical reflection of the power 
structures that lies in clinical encounter. For better appreciation of this, we 
196
V. L. PIEDADE AND G. MESSAS

should discuss the concept of epistemic injustices, coined by philosopher 
Miranda Fricker (2007).
Fricker's work highlights the cognitive and emotional features of injus­
tice, allowing a deeper understanding of the ways prejudice and exclusion 
operates within the individual experience. Epistemic injustices refer to 
situations where a person is unable to express her knowledge, being 
wronged in his capacity as a knower. This mostly happens in two forms: 
testimonial injustice, when prejudice from the hearer causes a diminished 
level of credibility for the speaker; and hermeneutical injustice, when there's 
a gap in the speaker tools of self-interpretation regarding its own experience 
(Fricker, 2007).
Consider a woman from a minority and historically oppressed group. It is 
very likely that, in a clinical context, she will face situations of prejudice and 
testimonial injustice. To have her voice heard (and be recognized as 
a knower), she may try to become like the oppressor, by introjecting not 
only his appearance and behavior but also his knowledge and discourse. In 
this sense, her status as an epistemic agent depends not only on her 
intellectual background and lived experience but also on the level of assim­
ilation she can transmit from the knowledge originated from dominant 
groups. A good example of this situation is found in the works of Frantz 
Fanon (1952), regarding the role of colonialism and racism in European 
societies.
However, this unconscious act, while aiming recognition and empower­
ment, tends to annihilate her former perspective and reaffirm the hegemo­
nic interpretation over time. If this action happens uncritically (without 
awareness of the implicit acts of silencing and exclusion), this person is very 
likely to commit another testimonial injustice if he or she decides to become 
a clinician. In a Hegelian manner, Freire states that, once the transmission of 
knowledge is done, the oppressed can become an oppressor, by introjecting 
its shadow in himself.
A situation of injustice also perpetuates over time if there's a lack of 
collective hermeneutic resources to explain it in plain words. Our under­
standing of the world is just as large as our vocabulary to describe it, or, in 
the words of Wittgenstein (2001), "the limits of my language mean the limits 
of my world". Language has also taken a special place in the phenomen­
ological tradition, as it is the means through which our sense of being-in-the 
-world is truly embodied (Merleau-Ponty, 1962; L. Spencer, 2021).
Let's take psychosis and the formation of delusions as an example. While 
often described as incomprehensible, delusions can also serve fundamental 
tools of meaning, whether providing meaning for personal, anomalous 
experiences, or enhancing one's sense of agency and general meaning in 
life (R. Ritunnano et al., 2022; R. Ritunnano & Bortolotti, 2022). To 
acknowledge this, one must be open to the different possibilities that are 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
197

brought into light through the person's discourse and not close himself to 
the limits of the biomedical language and worldview.
This brings us, once again, to the inconsiderate use of biomedical, 
psychopharmacological terminology as the only meaningful way of expres­
sing mental disorders. For instance, the use of antidepressants, especially 
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI, such as Prozac), has been 
related to alterations in one's identity and sense of self (Kramer, 1994). 
However, one may not find the right words to describe this experience, since 
alterations of self or identity are not mentioned in prescriptions and leaflets 
or even considered in traditional clinical trials. Once this experience is not 
acknowledged, we have a potential case of hermeneutic injustice where 
speech plays an important role as a tool to power.
To avoid such situations, however, it is necessary not only to have an 
attentive hearing but also engaging in a program of change. Some attempts 
have been made on the inclusion of the experts by experience or the 
psychopathologized into research (Knox, 2022), aiming to increase our 
comprehension of first-person experiences - an objective of both political 
and scientific interest.
Finally, the acknowledgment of oppression must be taken in educational 
contexts, such as medical and psychological schools. Teachers and students 
should engage in group studies and thematic circles along with other 
stakeholders, such as patients and multidisciplinary crew, creating an envir­
onment of trust that allows testimonies from different backgrounds and 
perspectives.
4. Possible contributions of Freire to mental health
In this final section, we will show how Freire's ideas can be integrated in 
contemporary research and clinical practice in mental health. Rather than 
creating a new method, we hope to provide some insights that will help 
researchers and clinicians within phenomenological psychopathology to 
acknowledge the social aspects that constitutes lived experience, along 
with the implicit, pre-reflexive categories of the lifeworld. Especially, we 
hope to bring forward the fact that, when facing a problem of injustice and 
oppression, taking a political stance is not only the most ethical thing to do 
but also the most therapeutic.
4.1. Field work and research
Nowadays, research in mental health has been leaning toward methods that 
aims to minimize epistemic injustices. One major trend is the co-writing or 
co-production, where clinician and patient are mutually engaged in writing 
a narrative related to the patient's experience (Faccio et al., 2023; L. Spencer 
198
V. L. PIEDADE AND G. MESSAS

& Kidd, 2023). For this, different methods have been employed in field 
works, borrowed from anthropology and social sciences, such as grounded 
theory and ethnography (Klinke & Fernandez, 2023; Køster & Fernandez,  
2021).
Particularly, these methods have been highly linked to phenomen­
ology and values theory. From phenomenology, it derives the ability 
to capture lived experience in its most fundamental aspect: the life­
world (or Lebenswelt), or the implicit horizon of our experiences, and 
its dimensions of temporality, spatiality, embodiment, and intersub­
jectivity (Messas, 2021; Stanghellini & Mancini, 2017). From values 
theory, one captures the personal beliefs, concerns and preferences 
that guides a person's attitude toward the world (K. Fulford, 2017; 
Woodbridge-Dodd & Fulford, 2004).
It is our understanding that Freire's method can be beneficially 
incorporated into contemporary research on phenomenology and 
values. The itinerary can be seen as a form of participative research, 
which values different knowledges from different sources, building 
a science that is politically engaged with social transformation. This 
speaks directly with contemporary programs of critical phenomenology, 
which aims to:
Describes, interrogates and transforms the contingent, historical yet quasi- 
transcendental structures that shapes the meaning and materiality of the experience. 
(Guenther, 2021)
In this sense, Freire and critical phenomenology aims at creating a praxis, 
where theory and practice happens at the same time, creating and reflecting. 
In Sartre words, they intend to "make the road by walking" (as cited in 
Guenther, 2021, p. 17).
Recently, L. Spencer and Broome (2023) suggested that the method of 
empathic understanding is prone to epistemic injustices, as it requires (as 
a fundamental step) that the clinician recreate the patient's lifeworld within 
himself, thereby risking co-opting his lived experience. They advocate then 
that clinicians should adopt a more proactive listening style, in which the 
collective experience with the patient is taken into consideration, in line 
with Miranda Fricker's concept of "virtuous listening" (L. Spencer & 
Broome, 2023).
Whether or not this may be the case, Freire's methodology seems closer 
to a virtuous listening (and, therefore, in line with Fricker's ideas) and some 
forms of ethnography than on traditional psychopathology interviews. Also, 
a Freirean program is already co-written between researcher and partici­
pant, since they are constantly involved in constructing and reviewing the 
project, bringing a much-needed balance of voices.

4.2. Towards a "psychotherapy of the oppressed"
Once again, rather than creating a new method, we hope to provide 
insights for the therapist to deal with specific situations where someone's 
experience is being influenced by injustice and oppression. This, we 
hope, can be useful for the construction of a new paradigm of mental 
health.
Our proposal is within the limits dialogical psychotherapy, such as Open 
Dialogue and PHD method (Seikkula, 2019; Stanghellini, 2019). We are in 
line with Stanghellini and Mancini (2017) that symptoms can be seen and 
analyzed as a text, making the work of psychopathology also a hermeneutic 
endeavor. This idea also contributes to bringing closer the worlds of psy­
chopathology (and psychology itself) and education, for the therapist (like 
the teacher) would lead and help the patient to read its own text (i.e., his 
symptoms).7 This approach can also be considered "ecological", due to its 
focus on the individual and its relations with the other and the environment 
(in German, Umwelt) (Fuchs, 2019) and requires a dialectal phenomenolo­
gical diagnosis (Messas et al., 2022b), since the unveiling of the world 
demands the person to capture reality in its entirety, which includes con­
flicts between pairs of opposite forces.8
Like Freirean research, we start from a concrete existential situation, 
which (most of the times) are the reasons why someone chooses to engage 
in a therapeutic process. Let's take, for instance, Sabrina: a black, Brazilian 
woman who works on a call center over eight hours per day and attends 
a psychiatric appointment reporting severe depressive symptoms and recur­
rent anxiety attacks.9
Being a phenomenological method, the initial focus will be unveiling the 
lifeworld - for instance, how someone experiences lived space and time. She 
will probably provide describe overwhelming negative feelings, being unable 
to experience new positive emotions, a loss of purpose and an intense 
sensation of being incarcerated into her own body (Fusar-Poli et al.,  
2023). At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to the way the 
person narrates their biography and relationships, which illuminates their 
individual and cultural values and worldviews, maybe an over reliance on 
family and personal commitments.
Throughout this process, the therapist must search for the limit- 
situations that evolves the patient. Limit-situation (in German, 
Grundsituation) is a term taken from Karl Jaspers' philosophy of existence 
and refers to moments that make explicit the antinomic structure of 
Existence (Jaspers, 1967). They are situations common for all people when 
one's philosophy of life and attitude toward the world - also called housing 
(in German, Gehause) - is under threat, such as death, illness, and guilt 
(Fuchs, 2013).

V. L. PIEDADE AND G. MESSAS

During the therapeutic process, Sabrina describes one episode in 
which her symptoms became latent: the violent death of her older 
sibling, which occurred when she was at an early age. Since then, she 
has become increasingly frightened of death or being trapped 
in situations she cannot overcome, which increases her feelings of 
depression and anxiety.
Freire also acknowledge sociocultural situations that are not uni­
versal (or ontological) but nevertheless undermines the evolution of 
being. For him, underdevelopment was the ultimate situation, but we 
can also think of injustices, racism, harassment, etc. The idea is that 
the situation serves as a start for critical reflection upon the reality the 
person is embedded in, taking care of not being too elusive (so that 
a person feels alienated) or explicit (so that a person may feel 
offended). According to Freire, most people will only recognize 
a fragment of the situation and it's the facilitator job to help them 
to apprehend reality in its entirety.
Through an attentive hearing, the therapist can help Sabrina realize 
that her sister's fate is also part of a deeper structure of many 
societies: the consequence of poverty, inequality, and racism. This 
acknowledgment can be achieved through a process of coding and 
decoding, where the person will be stimulated to consider herself in 
other situations, showing that (1) her condition is not only of her 
fault, and (2) that fundamental changes can happen with her partici­
pation. Phenomenology will help us in the exploration of her funda­
mental experiences and will show how her perception of the world is 
transformed by these higher social structures.
Finally, this can help Sabrina not only to understand herself but to 
play an active role in changing her reality. Considering the impor­
tance that she gives to family and community, Sabrina may engage 
with social programs in her neighborhood or start working in social 
service, for example. This, along with use of antidepressants for 
symptomatic relief and other psychotherapy techniques, can enhance 
her critical analysis of reality and reduce her fears and distress to 
a more tolerable level, while giving her a sense of meaning and 
purpose in life.
For this, it is fundamental that the clinician do not give preordered 
answers to her calls but engage with her in a true dialogue, allowing himself 
to use her language and concrete examples of life. This nearly pedagogical 
process will eventually incorporate the clinicians' knowledge to the patient's 
values and experiences, while respecting her worldview. Also, dialogue 
allows the therapist to free himself from the mere role of giver of knowledge 
and become another person, building a therapy with the patient, not for the 
patient - a truly "psychotherapy of the oppressed".

5. Conclusions
Throughout this paper, we have expressed our concerns with the current 
paradigm of mental health practice and research. Borrowing Paulo 
Freire's terminology, we have classified most of contemporary models 
of treatment as "banking models" of therapy, where a giver-receiver 
relation between clinician (whether a psychiatrist or psychologist) and 
patient is promptly established, focusing not on dialogue, but on repeti­
tion and confirmation. These situations are particularly prone to episte­
mic injustice, since is only the clinician who holds the epistemic 
resources and knowledge that should be deposit into another person, 
leaving virtually no room for an investigation of lived experience and an 
exchange of worldviews.
After a brief exposition of Freire's biography and main ideas, we 
provide some insights for a phenomenologically oriented psychother­
apy that acknowledges the social aspects that constitutes lived experi­
ence. For this, we also borrow the three major steps of Freire's 
methodology or research itinerary: (1) thematic investigation, (2) 
coding and decoding, and (3) unveiling of the world. We hope these 
tools may help the clinician consider the power dynamics at play, 
while creating an environment of mutual help and investigation that 
is based on dialogue.
We see two possible paths in which phenomenological psychopathology 
and psychotherapy can gain from incorporating some of Freire's ideas. First, 
is the adoption of "culture circles" in clinical research. This methodology, 
along with a phenomenological investigation of lived experience, can 
increase our knowledge on the relation between transcendental structures 
(such as temporality or spatiality) and values, providing us insights on how 
culture and society can shape our experience of the world. Also, these circles 
help us to avoid situations of epistemic injustices that are usually related to 
psychiatric research and are in line with current projects of co-production 
and democratic participation.
Second, we believe that Freire's approach can be useful for clinicians who 
face situations of injustice in their practices. More than creating a new 
method, this "psychotherapy of the oppressed" draws largely from dialogical 
psychotherapy, using phenomenology, hermeneutics, and dialogue as fun­
damental tools. Our proposal starts with the limit-situations lived by the 
patient that provides context for a larger critical reflection on reality, in 
a pedagogical process.
We hope that these insights can help build a new mental health paradigm 
that can be seen as a "praxis of freedom", where every actor and stakeholder 
is freed from its constraints, reducing the many possibilities of injustice and 
oppression in this encounter.

Notes
1. In antient Greek, the role of the guardian or tutor was called paidagōgos, meaning "to 
lead a child"(Harper, n.d.a). It is worth clarifying, however, that the role of both 
teacher and student at that time was exclusive to men and boys.
2. The vote of all citizens, regardless of their literacy, gender, race, or economic statues 
was only considered in 1985, during the first elections of the new democratic regime.
3. Google Scholar page accessed on January 27, 2024.
4. Somehow, this idea is not so far apart from Heidegger's concept of "being-in-the- 
world" (in German, In-der-Welt-sein) and his refusal of the cartesian distinction 
between Subject-Object (Heidegger et al., 1996).
5. The word "praxis" is originated in Greek philosophy, being used by Aristotle to 
describe three basic activities of men: theoria (thinking), poiesis (making), and 
praxis (doing). However, Freire's use of the concept is closer to Karl Marx's 
understanding as a human activity in "which man creates (makes, produces) and 
changes (shapes) his historical, human world and himself" (Bottomore, 1985, 
p. 435). This means not only making but also reflecting on the action itself at 
the same time (action and reflection at the same time). For Freire, the sacrifice of 
action equals verbalism, while the sacrifice of reflection means activism (Freire,  
2005, p. 87).
6. Even etymologically, these functions have different meanings, since therapy is derived 
from the Greek therapeia, meaning "curing, healing" rather than "leading" (Harper, n. 
d.b).
7. In this sense, the relation between symptom and body/brain would be like that of text 
and paper, where the last is the condition of possibilities for the appearance of the first 
but has little or nothing to say as a method of interpretation. For instance, if the paper 
is in bad conditions, one cannot read the text presented, but it is impossible to say 
whether a novel is good or bad based on the paper conditions alone.
8. We have here a general understanding of dialectics as the "back-and-forth movement 
between opposites aimed at integration without elimination or reduction" (Messas 
et al., 2022a). It is not our intention to enter the whole ramifications and complexities 
of Hegelian philosophy. However, it is worth noting that this process also brings us 
closer to Freire's affinities with Marxism and Hegelianism.
9. This case is inspired by a person attended by one of the authors (VP) for the course of 
two years. Her name and conditions has been changed to avoid identification.
