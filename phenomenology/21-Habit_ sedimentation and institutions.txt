ABSTRACT
In contrast to intellectualist and behaviorist conceptions of habit, recent enactivist 
discussions argue that habits reflect a type of contextualized intelligence. This enactive 
anti-intellectualist view is a close cousin to the pragmatist and phenomenological 
conceptions of habit as embedded in bodily modes of response and sedimented in 
modes of perception. The phenomenological concept of sedimentation, however, 
provides a way to understand how habits relate to social/cultural/institutional factors, 
not unlike Bourdieu's concept of habitus (and in spite of Bourdieu's criticism of Husserl). 
Despite some important differences between the phenomenological and enactive 
approaches to habit, I argue that the concept of sedimentation can enrich the enactive 
analysis, allowing for a dynamical understanding of the role played by social, cultural 
and institutional factors in habit formation, and the role played by  habit in the 
formation of institutions.
1.  Introduction
Recent discussions of habit in the enactivist literature agree that habits are not like rigid reflexes; instead 
they reflect a type of contextualized intelligence. This enactive anti-intellectualist view is a close cousin 
to the pragmatist conception of habit. Enactive and pragmatist approaches steer a course away from 
both intellectualist and behaviorist views and offer a nuanced conception of habit that can be produc­
tively applied to contexts that involve everyday action and more specialized skilled performance. Starting 
from a different perspective, phenomenological analyses focus on the concept of sedimentation and 
offer an alternative treatment of habit. Significantly, the phenomenological concept of sedimentation 
introduces an additional dimension that is so far missing in the enactive account. I'll argue that this 
dimension, which concerns the role of social and institutional structure, is related to Pierre Bourdieu's 
concept of habitus, and can also be a productive addition to the pragmatic-enactive account.
In Section 2 I outline the pragmatic-enactive account of habit as found in a number of theorists (e.g. 
Cappuccio et  al., 2021; Di Paolo et  al., 2017; Hutto & Robertson, 2020; Ilundáin-Agurruza et al., 2020) 
many of whom make reference to the pragmatist John Dewey. On this view habit is the kind of intelli­
gent, heedful process found in expert performance, in contrast to intellectualist (e.g. Stanley, 2011) and 
behaviorist (e.g. Ryle, 1949) views that take habit to be a blindly repetitive rigid behavior. In Section 3 
my aim is to show how the phenomenological concept of sedimentation, as developed by Husserl, adds 
a missing dimension to the enactive story about habit, motivating a distinction between the stable per­
sistence of habitual structure, and the flexible exercise of habit. The phenomenology of habits suggests 
that they have recursive effects. That is, they are not only action-oriented and worldly directed in their 
flexibility, but they also shape us, making us who we are by introducing a kind of stability to our actions. 
In Section 4 I argue that the concept of sedimentation allows us to scale up the enactive story to 
account for how, in contexts of social interactions, habits develop into cultural practices and institutions. 
We find resources for this realization in Husserl's later, generative phenomenology, something overlooked

by Pierre Bourdieu's interpretation of Husserl, but nonetheless duly expressed in his concept of habitus. 
These ideas lead, in Section 5, to an attempt to show how habitual practices depend not just on an 
individual agent's skill level or cognitive ability, but on other people, material goods, environmental fac­
tors, social institutions, and normative structures, all of which we need to negotiate in our everyday lives. 
Institutions, like the habits they are based on, have a structuring effect on our actions and interactions, 
but also like habits, they are transformed by those same actions and interactions. In the concluding 
Section 6, after a brief summary, I indicate some issues for further research.
2.  Intellectualism, pragmatism and enactive accounts of habit
I'll start with a brief review of some recent discussions of habit from the enactive perspective. Enactivism 
takes issue with both intellectualistic and behaviorist views. For both intellectualism and certain forms of 
behaviorism habit is considered to be nothing more than repetitious, mechanical routine. On the one 
hand, intellectualists argue that 'habituality is expressive of action or thinking which is uncritical, unthink­
ing, and disengaged' (McGuirk, 2016, p. 204). On the other hand, on the behaviorist side, an 
anti-intellectualist and defender of know-how like Gilbert Ryle nonetheless contrasts habits with intelli­
gent dispositions (beliefs) and characterizes habit as a form of behavioral repetition, the doing of some­
thing 'automatically and without having to mind what he is doing' (Ryle, 1949, p. 42). Weick and Roberts 
(1993, p. 362), for example, defend the Rylean position: 'In habitual action, each performance is a replica 
of its predecessor, whereas in heedful performance, each action is modified by its predecessor'. 
Intellectualists and behaviorists thus agree that habit is a form of automaticity, characterized by repeti­
tion.1 Stanley (2011), representing the intellectualist camp, regards the kind of motor control processes 
involved in habit to be fully automatic (blindly doing the same thing in each circumstance and therefore 
requiring propositional guidance) and 'perfectly general', i.e. not specifically attuned to the particular 
situation. Even those who propose a middle position between intellectualism and behaviorism about 
skilled action, understood to be a combination (a 'meshed architecture') of cognition and motoric pro­
cesses, often treat habit itself as mindless, in need of top-down cognitive control which focuses on 
'strategic aspects of performance [modulating bottom-up, habitual] automatic processes more concerned 
with implementation' (Christensen et  al. 2016, p. 43).
In contrast to these positions the enactivists consider habits to be intelligent, 'flexible and adjustable 
modes of response that are world-directed and context-sensitive' (Hutto & Robertson, 2020, p. 204; also 
see Cappuccio et al., 2021). For them habit can be considered an intelligent disposition, which, as Hutto 
and Robertson indicate 'breaks faith with the narrow, stimulus-response conception' of the strict behav­
iorists. Hutto and Robertson argue that habits fit a range of activities or 'doings' (located between 
unthinking behavior and intellectually guided actions) - 'Doings are unlike mere reflexive reactions in 
that they are coordinated, world-targeted activities that loop into and are interactively responsive to 
specific aspects of the environment' (p. 210). Responsiveness to the world, and specifically to variations 
in circumstances is the mark of intelligent habit. Hence, citing the enactive account of Di Paolo et  al. 
(2017, p. 85), Hutto and Robertson indicate that habits include 'not just a tendency to self-sustain but 
to do so in a precarious manner' (Hutto et al., 2020, p. 211). Potential changes in one's situation are 
significant. Shifting environmental factors can elicit a reconfiguration of sensorimotor dispositions; habits 
that had been set up on one set of environmental factors can be pulled in a new direction by new 
objects that require different postures and movements.
To understand habits in the liberal way just proposed - as tendencies of living creatures to do certain kinds 
of things under certain, varying conditions - is precisely to abandon the idea that habits are mechanically 
crude or slavish, reactive responses driven by simple triggers. Habits are responsive in ways that make them 
quite unlike mere reflexive reactions. Yet, at the same time, they do not exhibit the sort of intelligence that 
requires positing representational or information processing capacities. (Hutto & Robertson, 2020, p. 213).2
The arguments for this rely on evidence from kinematic studies which show that habitual motor-control 
processes are not entirely inflexible. Instead, a particular action intention or goal requires the align­
ment or controlled integration of lots of moving parts across multiple varying timescales (many of 
which are too fast for conscious control), and an 'enormous number (which often reaches three 

Cogent Arts & Humanities
3
figures) of degrees of freedom' (Bernstein, 1984), in a controlled integration that is situation specific, 
adaptive, and highly dynamical. These processes thus involve a complex temporal organization includ­
ing anticipatory processes across skeletal and muscular geometries, kinematic phase constraints, and 
the dynamics that characterize the relationship between kinematics and geometry (Berthoz, 2000; 
Gallagher & Aguda, 2020). Situational attunement is an important part of the picture. A skillful base­
ball batter, for example, does not repeat the same swing on each up - her swing adjusts as she per­
ceives where fielders are positioned, who is on base, who is pitching, her intended strategy (e.g. 
placing the ball in center field vs bunting, etc.). As Sutton et  al. (2011) point out, the cricket batter 
must draw on current context and the conditions that are relevant to the game. Performance in this 
case is 'fast enough to be a reflex, yet it is perfectly context-sensitive' (p. 80). The highly practiced 
batter cannot be on automatic pilot, and their habitual performance needs to be attuned to changing 
situations.
Habits, according to the enactivists, involve a form of heedfulness, a form of mindfulness or intelli­
gence that does not amount to attentive, reflective cognition. Miyahara et  al. (2020), for example, argue 
that habitual action is heedful (specifically against Weick and Roberts' Rylean position that heedful per­
formance is not the same thing as habitual performance). They further argue that this enactivist position 
is consistent with the pragmatist conception of habit (also see Ilundáin-Agurruza et  al. 2020). For John 
Dewey, for example, habit describes a kind of general responsiveness to the world. He suggests that '[t]
he essence of habit is an acquired predisposition to ways or modes of response' (1983, p. 32). Rather 
than being repetitive, habit is an open and adaptive way in which the body learns to cope with chang­
ing situations. Such actions are characterized as habitual because there is something structurally homog­
enous about these ways of responding; they may have a broadly stereotyped character in terms of how 
they are enacted, a style of coping with varying situations. As Dewey puts it:
The medium of habit filters all the material that reaches our perception and thought. [...] Thus our purposes 
and commands regarding action [...] come to us through the refracting medium of bodily and moral habits.... 
Repetition is in no sense the essence of habit ... The essence of habit is an acquired predisposition to ways 
or modes of response ... (Dewey, 1983, pp. 26, 32).
Dewey distinguishes between intelligent and routine habit. The latter resembles the Rylean understanding 
of habit as a rote, mechanistic repetition of a behavioral response. One example may be tying my shoes 
- there is little to no attention or heedful attunement required. Dewey's view of routine habits, however, 
may be closer to the meshed architecture view of Christensen et  al. 2016), since, as he notes, they may 
also include 'a mechanism of action, physiologically engrained, which operates "spontaneously," automat­
ically, whenever the cue is given' (Dewey, 1983, p. 70). Intelligent habits, however, are 'fused with thought 
and feeling' (1983, p. 71). In this respect pragmatists, like enactivists, offer a deflationary (i.e. 
non-intellectualist) account of intelligence.
If we think of habit as a mesh of intelligence, feeling and motoric processes, as Dewey does, we can 
also think of the meshing itself as a habitual fusion of habitual elements, since intelligence, feeling and 
motoric processes are all, at least in part, habitual and heedful. Intelligence, in this sense, is not a sepa­
rate reflective faculty, but is rather an embedded heedful anticipation and adjustment process operating 
in perception and action. Habit, rather than rigid (or context-free) is guided by perceptual cues enabling 
spontaneous adjustments to the specifics of the environment. Perception in the service of habit is not a 
form of passive registration, but is enactive (action-oriented) and exploratory.
One final idea shared by both pragmatist and enactive views is that habit is relational. It's not simply 
something that inhabits my body as a kind of isolated autonomous power, or something that belongs 
neatly to the individual agent. It's more than a disposition to act; its existence depends on its activation 
as a feature of the organism-environment. As Dewey puts it, habits are organizations of bodily and envi­
ronmental processes.
[E]ye, arm, and hand are [...] means proper only when they are in active operation. And whenever they are 
in action they are cooperating with external materials and energies. Without support from beyond themselves 
the eye stares blankly and the hand moves fumblingly. They are means only when they enter into organisa­
tion with things which independently accomplish definite results. These organisations are habits. (Dewey, 
1983: 26)

From an enactive perspective, Di Paolo et  al. (2017) address some of these questions in terms of senso­
rimotor schemes understood as normatively organized patterns of coordinated body-world couplings, 
which, if they are self-sustaining (as organizations) are habits.
If and when the organization of the whole repertoire becomes itself autonomous (i.e. integrated parts of the 
whole repertoire become self-sustaining), then a new form of agency, a sensorimotor mode of becoming or 
sensorimotor body, emerges. (Di Paolo, 2021, p. 798).
The relational nature of habit takes on more significance when we start to think of the environment as 
not only material, but also social and cultural. This opens the way for further considerations (to which 
we return in Sections 4 and 5).
3. The phenomenology of habit
In the phenomenological literature habits are said to involve a process of 'sedimentation'. The concept of 
sedimentation, reflecting its Latin root sedēre, signifies a process akin to the deposition of sediments as 
described in geology or to a process of the settling of solids in a liquid, as described in chemistry.3 
Husserl provides an analysis of intrinsic temporality in which experiences and their meanings become 
sedimented in a temporalizing process; as sensory impressions are retained, rather than dissipate they 
sink into the unconscious past.4 The sedimented sense of our past experience, although no longer expe­
rienced, nonetheless can 'become affective once more' (2001, p. 178).
Indeed, for Husserl, sedimented experiences remain operative in ways that shape our perception and 
ongoing experience. Our perception becomes habitual, and habituated to the things around us. Some 
perceived object can awaken a dormant sense - stir up the sediment which may then cloud perception 
or make it even more meaningful. This is what happens when we see a cultural artifact. We see it 'with 
[its] specifically cultural properties, without any renewed process of making intuitive what gave such 
properties their true meaning' (Husserl, 1970, p. 26; see e.g. Rodemeyer, 2003). Our perception is not the 
activation of inferences, but the activation of sedimentations. Something similar can happen in judgment 
(Husserl, 2001, p. 443), and in regard to our habitual actions, and in the realm of affectivity where the 
sedimentation of affective processes 'is a passive habituality' (Husserl, 1989, p. 324). '[E]very accomplish­
ment of sense or of the object becomes sedimented in the realm of the ... dormant horizonal sphere, 
precisely in the manner of a fixed order of sedimentation' (Husserl, 2001, p. 227).
How rigid is this fixed order of sediment? On one interpretation it seems more geologically fixed than 
chemically fluid, and as a result, in contrast to pragmatic-enactive accounts, habit would seem to take 
on a kind of rigidity. Christian Ferencz-Flatz (2014), for example, links Husserl's analysis of habit to auto­
maticity. He suggests that the 'repeated performance of an action ... proves central in this respect ... 
since, by being repeated as such, an action ... becomes an object of habit, allowing for its merely auto­
matic execution' (p. 72).
In Husserl's view, habitual action is not merely ... an action that conforms to the habitual dispositions of the 
practical agent, but primarily an action that tends to become unfree and "mechanical" by no longer requiring 
his conscious attention.... [An] "action prior to attention" [Husserl]... that responds to impulses automatically, 
in reflex without paying any attention to them. (Ferencz-Flatz, 2014, p. 73)
On this view habit belongs to unfree nature, tied like a 'comet tail of automatism' to action and charac­
terized by a 'repetition compulsion' and a typical repeatability (Ferencz-Flatz, 2014, p. 81). It's important 
to note that this is a contested interpretation of Husserl. To be sure, in some contexts Husserl does talk 
about 'the unfree Ego' determined by 'an obscure underlying basis of traits of character, original and 
latent dispositions, and thereby dependent on nature' (1989, p. 289) - characterized by 'blind [or fixed] 
rules' - to which correspond 'habitual modes of behavior' which are part of 'the total habitus of the 
subject' (289-290). In other contexts, however, he associates habit with an 'autonomous, freely acting 
Ego' with the ability to resist impulse or drive - 'Here habit and free motivation intertwine' (1989, p. 
267). Moran (2011) outlines a more nuanced interpretation of Husserl's complex analysis of habit, includ­
ing the idea that habituality is associated with the 'I can', that is, one's activation of possible actions. In 
this regard the fact that Husserl's phenomenology undergoes some development from an early 'static' 

Cogent Arts & Humanities
5
phenomenology to the later 'genetic' and 'generative' analyses can help to adjudicate these interpreta­
tions (see Geniusas, 2024a; Moran, 2011; and Section 4 below).5
Picking up on the more static interpretation, however, Dieter Lohmar (2014, p. 4) notes that 'habits 
sometimes appear to be quite conservative and inflexible because they adjust only very slow to chang­
ing circumstances'. Lohmar has in mind the slowness we experience when we try to change a habit. We 
can acknowledge this kind of recalcitrance or stability, but it is also important to ask about the actual 
performance of habitual actions, and whether that stability in deeply sedimented habitual bodily move­
ment rules out a flexibility in the very function of habitual performance. We should make a distinction 
between the stable persistence of habitual structure, and the flexible exercise or performance of habit 
when we put habit to use.6
In Merleau-Ponty as in the enactivists we find the idea that habits in their use have a built-in flexibility. 
As Merleau-Ponty puts it: 'Habit expresses the power we have of dilating our being in the world, or of 
altering our existence through incorporating new instruments' (Merleau-Ponty, 2012, p. 145). We are not 
fixed in the worldly structure; the world that habit enacts is variable and our habits need to be open to 
that variability in their very performance. This flexibility is not about changing a habit, which may indeed 
be a slow process, but about exercising a habit where the principle is not Rylean repetition, but impro­
visation in response to changing circumstances. Habituality does not preclude skillful adjustment to vari­
ations in circumstance. For Merleau-Ponty, as for Dewey, habit is intelligent; 'The acquisition of the habit 
is surely the grasping of a signification...' (Merleau-Ponty, 2012, p. 144).
We should add that for both Husserl and Merleau-Ponty habits are two-way: they have recursive 
effects in so far as they are not only worldly directed, as Hutto and Robertson emphasize, but also as 
they shape our responses to the world with some degree of flexibility, they also shape us, making us 
who we are and introducing a kind of stability to our actions. The phenomenological conception of 
sedimentation brings this out more clearly than we find in the pragmatic-enactivist account. As Butler 
and Gallagher (2018, p. 48) suggest, 'due to the body's habitual and developmental character, our 
self-experience sediments into a recognizable pattern of habitual vectors of experience that show up for 
us prereflectively as opportunities for action'. At the same time, however, as a consequence of their 
stability, 'habits play a role in preserving the significance of our past in our present experience and in 
unifying our experience as a self for whom the world is present across disparate episodes of experience' 
(2018, p. 48). Habits provide an explanation of how our immediate prereflective awareness transitions 
into a coherent pattern expressed, for example, in narrative practices.
If we opt for a notion of sedimentation that includes not just a significant degree of flexibility in 
application but also some degree of structural stability I think that the pragmatic-enactive account gains 
something important. To see this we need to revisit a richer account of sedimentation found in Husserl, 
and we can do that by seeing what Pierre Bourdieu failed to see.
4.  Habitus: Bourdieu's misguided critique of Husserl
In this section I'll argue that although Bourdieu develops a critique of Husserl's concepts of habit and 
sedimentation, his own concept of habitus is not unrelated to the analysis of sedimentation found in 
Husserl's later, generative approach. The important contrasts between Husserl and Bourdieu do not lie 
where Bourdieu thinks they lie.
Bourdieu's notion of habitus is characterized as a set of 'systems of durable transposable dispositions, 
structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures... principles that organize and 
generate practices and representation' (1990, p. 53). For Bourdieu, habitus functions as an anonymous 
collective system that institutes and stabilizes practices in a society. Habitus, as Bourdieu puts it (follow­
ing Aristotle), gets 'internalized as second nature' (Bourdieu, 1990, pp. 56. 68, and 239), and as such it is 
a kind of social production/reproduction (p. 73). It's not, however, that it necessarily emanates from a 
human first nature; it rather has obscure, anonymous origins. He describes 'the obscure depths of a 
historically constituted habitus, which means that, in normal circumstances, one gets up every day to go 
to work without deliberating on the issue, as indeed one did yesterday and will do tomorrow' (Bourdieu, 
2005, p. 10). A habitus is linked to 'the social and cognitive structures of a particular social order' which 
constrain or shape a subject-less perception (Bourdieu, 2005, pp. 10, 73).

S. GALLAGHER
The individual, the subjective, is social and collective. The habitus is socialized subjectivity, a historic transcen­
dental, whose schemes of perception and appreciation (systems of preferences, tastes, etc.) are the product of 
collective and individual history. (Bourdieu, 2005, p. 211)
That said, there is something of the enactive flexibility in Bourdieu's concept:'habitus is in no sense a 
mechanical principle of action or, more exactly, of reaction (it is not a 'reflex'). It is conditioned and lim­
ited spontaneity. It is that autonomous principle which means that action is not simply an immediate 
reaction to a brute reality, but an 'intelligent' response to an actively selected aspect of the real' (Bourdieu, 
2005, pp. 211-212).
When Husserl uses the term, 'habitus', he links it to sedimentation.
[L]ived experience itself, and the objective moment constituted in it, may become 'forgotten'; but for all this, 
it in no way disappears without a trace; it has merely become latent. With regard to what has been consti­
tuted in it, it is a possession in the form of a habitus, ready at any time to be awakened anew by an active 
association ... The object has [therefore] incorporated into itself the forms of sense originally constituted in 
the acts of explication by virtue of a knowledge in the form of a habitus. (Husserl, 1972: 122, emphasis in the 
original)
Bourdieu is critical of Husserl, however, for limiting habit to the realm of conscious subjectivity and for 
failing to recognize habit's connection to practical know-how (Bourdieu, 2000, pp. 81-82; Bourdieu, 
2002).7 Indeed, Husserl does emphasize the individual personality. Where Bourdieu allows no individual 
control over the socially constituted habitus, Husserl seems to allow just that:
habitus is essentially conditioned by the way in which the personality, as this particular individuality, is moti­
vated by acts of its own experience and no less by the way in which it takes in foreign and transmitted 
experiences by approving of or rejecting them. (Husserl, 2002, p. 249).8
If Bourdieu is criticizing Husserl for not acknowledging social factors, it's important to note that Husserl, 
especially in his later generative phenomenology, does acknowledge the social, specifically in terms of 
tradition. Dermot Moran summarizes:
Husserl talks of habituality not just in relation to the formation of the individual person and character but also 
in relation to the social and cultural spheres, the sphere of "spirit" (Geist). In this regard, in a text from 
1921/1922 Husserl speaks not only of the habituality that belongs to the "single ego" (Einzel-Ich), but also of 
'a social habituality' (eine Gemeinschaftshabitualität) which may also be called a 'tradition' (eine Tradition). 
(Moran, 2011, p. 65).
Bourdieu may be correct in his criticism if the claim is that Husserl makes all of the habitualities, includ­
ing the social, a matter of sedimentation in the individual agent/ego, affecting the individual's way of 
relating to the world. As we noted, for the phenomenologist, habits involve a two-way directionality. Not 
only world-directed (Husserl, 1970, §9b), habits are what make me what/who I am; they are generated 
in me and they shape my character from the inside out. A habit is my 'possession in the form of a habitus 
(ein habitueller Besitz)' (Husserl, 1972, p. 122). I am constitutively my habits, where habituality signifies a 
certain egoic possibility. Whether the product of instinct, natural drives, or repetitive practices, or the fact 
that I adopt a set of norms, whether rigid or flexible - habits shape my perception, emotional response, 
judgment, all of which are directed towards the world.
For Husserl, however, there is more to this than just a set of individual processes. For Husserl one can 
come under the influence of the other, and that influence can enter one's own habitus (Husserl, 1983, p. 
281; see Moran, 2011). Perhaps even more significantly,
Besides the tendencies which proceed from other individual persons, there are demands which arise in the 
intentional form of indeterminate generality, the demands of morality, of custom, of tradition, of the spiritual 
milieu: 'one' judges in this way, 'one' has to hold his fork like this, and so on, i.e. demands of the social group, 
of the class, etc. They can be followed quite passively, or one can also actively take a position with regard to 
them and make a free decision in favour of them. (Husserl, 1983, pp. 281-282).
In this respect, however, Husserl's phenomenology is expressing something that Bourdieu himself wants 
to stress. Bourdieu seems to miss this emphasis on custom and tradition in Husserl, which comes very 
close to Bourdieu's own conception of habitus. For the later Husserl, ideas are sedimented culturally and

historically. Tradition is a socialized practical habit. As Anthony Steinbock puts it, 'Now [in his later work], 
rather than writing of the sedimentation of retention, Husserl writes of the sedimentation of a tradition 
... rather than reawakening and reactivating a temporal past, Husserl writes of reawakening and reacti­
vating an historical past' (Steinbock, 1998, p. 180). Much depends on how one interprets historical/cul­
tural sedimentations - one can understand them as sedimented in the medium of language (Geniusas, 
2024a) - but one could also think of them as sedimented in bodily habits (what Husserl called bodily 
habitus), as well as in cultural practices and institutions. Thus Woelert (2011, p. 120) suggests:
Husserl's notion of sedimentation can be expanded to not only apply to processes of stabilization and habit­
ualization taking place on the level of linguistic conceptualization, but also to certain stabilizing functions 
implicit in pre- and non-linguistic forms of conceptualization. These may either be conceptual processes that 
are based on recurrent embodied processes and sensorimotor patterns of spatial schematization ... or the sort 
of cognitive-conceptual processes that use as their formative medium (non-linguistic) material structures of 
the surround.
We should think that the 'material structures of the surround' include not just physical artifacts, but 
social and institutional practices. This raises the interesting question of whether these different processes 
realize the same or different kinds of sedimentation. The answer to this question will depend on how 
we conceive of the mechanisms that underpin sedimentation. It's beyond the scope of this paper to 
address that issue, but I have argued elsewhere that one can conceive of a general mechanism - that is 
to say, a way to describe how sedimentation works - based on the idea of 'transactional plasticity' 
(Gallagher, under review). The idea of transactional plasticity includes what Lambros Malafouris (2013) 
calls 'metaplasticity', which is the idea that changes in behavior can involve not only neuronal plasticity, 
but plastic changes in body, physical environment, social relations and cultural practices. It adds the idea 
that such heterogeneous changes take place through transactional processes (with reference to Dewey's 
notion of transaction). Just as there are different kinds of neural plasticity occurring on different times­
cales, from evolutionary to developmental, from perceptual to synaptic, where modulations may differ 
from one brain area to the next, so also there may be different kinds of transactional processes of sed­
imentation ranging from individual to intersubjective to cultural and institutional.
As part of the potential for change, Husserl understood sedimentation as a process that one might 
challenge. Thinking for oneself requires a philosophical spirit - an 'autonomous philosopher with the will 
to liberate himself from all prejudices, he must have the insight that all the things he takes for granted 
are prejudices, that all prejudices are obscurities arising out of a sedimentation of tradition...' (Husserl, 
1970, p. 72). Such a struggle suggests that sedimentations can be rigid or invariant - functioning as 
stabilized, typifying structures of meaning (Woelert, 2011). At the same time, Husserl admits that sedi­
mentations can serve a productive purpose. They can perform a scaffolding function that enables us to 
engage in a variety of practices, relying on past experience that include both personal and historical 
factors (Geniusas, 2024a). Moran (2011, p. 70) concludes: 'Although Bourdieu believes he is departing 
from Husserl's naïve and overly subjective descriptions, in fact the French sociologist is articulating quite 
precisely the kinds of generative structures to which Husserl himself drew attention'.9
5.  Habit from an institutional perspective
Consider a routine I practice every morning. I walk into my kitchen, open a cabinet above the counter 
and grab a cup with the intention to make a cup of tea. This is clearly a habitual action. I repeat it every 
day. Often it feels like I am on automatic pilot as I do this. I may be thinking about something else as 
I grab the cup. Motorically it seems as if it involves an identical set of movements - walking, reaching, 
grasping. But these are not necessarily identical or strictly repetitive since my partner or my dog may be 
in my way. I may have to go around or reach over one or both of them. There is not always the same 
number of cups in the cupboard, and they may be positioned slightly differently so that they afford 
grasping in slightly different ways. There are fine motor attunements that vary one day to the next. 
Despite these variations I always manage to grab a cup. One might think then that I've honed my 
cup-grabbing skill in a masterful way. That skillful habit, however, depends not just on me. It might not 
develop at all, or it might dissipate quite quickly if the physical arrangement of the kitchen was radically

variable. Imagine that the cabinetry in my kitchen rearranged itself each day, moving up or down on the 
wall, or shifting positions so that each morning as I walked into the kitchen I could never be sure where 
to find the cups. This scenario, however unlikely, makes a point. Namely, that even a simple motoric 
habit is never just a motoric process, but depends on environmental features - in this case, the stability 
of my kitchen cabinets. Change the environment and what I refer to as 'my habit' dissipates. So in this 
case my habit is relational; not so much the activation of an inner disposition, as a process that includes 
external constraints and prompts that involve environmental features. Habits, one might say, are in the 
affordances, and affordances are relational, so that my habitual action is a negotiation with the world. 
When the world is my kitchen I typically win the negotiation since my cabinets like to stay where they 
are. But not everything in the world stays where it is.
Husserl's notion of sedimented structures and traditions, and Bourdieu's notion of habitus allow us to 
think about larger worldly arrangements. My kitchen cabinets stay put, but the cash machine I use may 
not be working; my bank may be closed for the holiday; our meeting for lunch everyday may be dis­
rupted if I am ill and need to stay home, or if you are super busy today. Such inconveniences show how 
much we depend on machines, banks, restaurants, other people and larger institutions for our habitual 
practices. Habitual practices depend not just on an agent's skill level and in some cases cognitive ability, 
but on other people, material goods, ecological factors, social institutions, and normative structures, all 
of which we need to negotiate in our everyday lives.
Bourdieu suggests that the habitus is objective and external to the individual agent. Whether we 
agree that such external factors, such as institutions, originate anonymously or are generated in individ­
ual and intersubjective processes (Gallagher, 2013, 2020), or whether they are internalized traditions as 
Husserl would contend, an explanation of habit requires that we say something about them.10
For the most part we can say that to the extent that such structures and institutions remain stable, 
so do our habits. We often want to engineer our environments to support such stability. We want our 
kitchen cabinets to stay in place; we want machines to work; we want to be able to find our banks and 
restaurants, we want to depend on rituals and institutions. Our habits would be non-existent otherwise.
Environments are not always engineered well, however. Not everything lends itself to being in the 
flow. And often, instead of a well-engineered environment we find ourselves with bricolage. The experi­
ence of flow indicates something about how habits can fluidly adapt to the demands of situations, or 
how we can skillfully cope with the constraints presented by the environment. The flow, however, is not 
merely an experience that happens in us; it's a characteristic of the agentive situation that we are in. 
Everything flows when our negotiations go smoothly and fall into place. A completely mindless experi­
ence of flow, as Dreyfus (2002) sometimes describes it, is a somewhat rare state.11 Inhabiting the world 
typically involves a heedful engagement that is none the less part of our habitual practices, on a con­
tinuum that moves from flow to different degrees of heedful performances (Miyahara et  al. 2020). Our 
experience tends to be more articulated, often requiring a heedful attitude and a world-oriented adap­
tation of our habits. This is especially the case when we are interacting with others.
The vast majority of real-life arrangements come about through chance, happenstance, fortunate or 
unfortunate accident, starting with an instituted past, but resulting in a heterogeneous bricolage rather 
than engineered arrangement. As Daniil Frolov suggests, this bricolage is 'an organic feature of complex 
institutional systems' (2024, p. 187). Practices and institutions undergo continuous reconstruction without 
rules or performance criteria paving the way, a process that speeds up in contexts that involve social 
media, transforming many habitual practices from one day to the next (Frolov, 2024, p. 188).
Institutions, like the habits and routines they are based on, have a structuring effect on our actions 
and interactions, but also like habits, they are transformed by those same actions and interactions. This 
kind of analysis fits well with the pragmatic-enactive account of habit, but goes beyond what that 
account currently offers to the extent that it includes a role for sedimentation. Resources for this kind of 
analysis can be found in Bourdieu, and despite Bourdieu's criticism, in phenomenologists like Husserl.
6.  Conclusion
To summarize, recent discussions of habit in the enactivist literature agree with pragmatist approaches 
that habit reflects a type of contextualized intelligence. The pragmatic-enactive analysis of habit 

Cogent Arts & Humanities

steers a course away from both intellectualist and behaviorist views and offers a nuanced concep­
tion that can be productively applied to contexts that involve everyday action and more specialized 
skilled performance. I've argued that by introducing the phenomenological concept of sedimenta­
tion we can get a richer account that extends the line of analysis from habits to social and cultural 
practices, and to the formal routines that define institutions. In the course of my argument I've 
highlighted several important features of habits and the sedimentation process, including (1) the 
productive tension between the structural stability of sedimented meanings, customs, traditions, and 
the flexibility involved in habitual performance and application; (2) the idea that habits have recur­
sive effects, they are two-way - both worldly directed, and self-shaping, making us who we are and 
introducing a kind of stability to our actions; (3) the idea that habits are relational and not simply 
dispositions internal to individuals; and (4) that, because of this relationality, the sedimentation of 
habits already includes the social, cultural and institutional dimensions to which both Husserl and 
Bourdieu point.
The argument at this point remains more like an outline of a larger project. There is clearly more work 
to do to flesh out the details. First, one would need to make the concept of sedimentation more precise 
and, if possible, resolve some of the scholarly debate around interpretations of Husserl and some of the 
conflicting conceptions of habit and sedimentation in other theorists. It would be productive to consider 
how different forms of sedimentation, as portrayed in static, genetic, and generative phenomenology 
(see Geniusas, 2024b), for example, relate to bridging the analyses of habit and institution. Likewise, one 
would need to say more about how the sedimentation process works, and here I've only pointed to the 
concept of transactional plasticity. Second, one would need to say more about the fact that institutions 
not only operate in ways that impose structure on our habitual actions and interactions, as Bourdieu and 
others rightly point out, but are also themselves enacted by our habitual actions and interactions [see 
Gallagher et al. (2019, under review) for a discussion of this issue in the context of institutional econom­
ics]. Third, one would have to say more about why, despite the oftentimes rigid structural features to be 
found in habitual and institutional practices, in their performance and application we often encounter 
bricolage rather than an abstract or homogenous rationality. This also relates to, fourth, the question of 
whether sedimentation can ever go wrong. Indeed, if at the institutional level we can recognize where 
sedimentation leads to social pathologies, this would then motivate a critical theoretical approach. These 
are issues for future consideration.
Notes
	 1.	
This view informs much of the recent work on habit in cognitive science (for reviews see Ramírez-Vizcaya & 
Froese, 2019; Wood & Rünger, 2016). I note, however, that there is significant equivocation in the literature 
about the meaning of 'automaticity'. The idea that a movement is automatic means for some authors (e.g., 
Ryle) that it is blindly mechanical and reactive, for others automatized actions are not necessarily blind or 
mindless responses but may reflect complex sensitivities to both context and the agent's intentions. As Barbara 
Montero (2016, p. 42) notes, "the concept is understood in myriad ways in the philosophy and psychology 
literature." See Cappuccio (2023) for an excellent discussion of the use of this term.
	 2.	
The distinction between habit and reflexive reactions may be less clear if we take into consideration the 
adaptive flexibility of long-latency reflexes which involve super-fast (50-100 ms) adjustments to compensate 
for different loads on muscles and limb dynamics (see Kurtzer, 2014). Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for 
pointing this out.
	 3.	
Husserl uses two terms that are translated as sedimentation. Saulius Geniusas (2024a, p. 2) explains: "The term 
Niederschlag is borrowed from everyday speech and it refers to precipitation, rainfall, and sediment. By con­
trast, the concept of Sedimentierung is borrowed from geology, where it refers to a natural process through 
which rock formations come into existence, starting with small pieces of sand, stone and other materials that 
have been left over by water, ice, or wind.".
	 4.	
"Sedimentation in the inconspicuous substratum (unconsciousness)" (Husserl, 1969, p. 318). Husserl describes 
"the so-called 'unconscious', which, far from being a phenomenological nothing, is itself a limit-mode of con­
sciousness." (Husserl, 1969, p. 319).
	 5.	
One of the journal's anonymous reviewers asked whether we should think of Husserl's analysis of sedimenta­
tion as a strictly transcendental analysis or whether sedimentation is a natural process that could be investi­
gated by natural science. It's a good question. Husserl answers it, at least in part. In discussing the "sensuous 
dispositions of [an individual's] habitus," he says: "Obviously, how far all this extends can only be decided 
empirically and if possible by means of experimental psychology" (1989, p. 308).

This is similar to Bruno Latour's (1986) distinction between ostensive and performative aspects applied to 
habit. The ostensive aspect of a habit indicates its stable structure. The performative aspect concerns specific 
actions and applications characterized by the specifics of who is involved, when and where, and for what 
purpose. The flexibility in application is undermined if we take habit to preclude other possible actions as 
Witney Howell (2015) suggests: "once [habit] has been established, it becomes exclusive, and reigns as the 
primary and preferred way of relating to the world" (2015, p. 326). This would be contrary to the 
pragmatic-enactive interpretation as well as much of what Husserl says. In this respect Husserl describes dif­
ferent forms of reawakening or reactivating sedimented meanings. For a good discussion of these different 
forms of reactivating, and their relation to innovation see Geniusas (2024b).
	 7.	
"Bourdieu stresses the anonymous, passive and conservative nature of habitus and, in declared opposition 
to his version of Husserl, downplays the role of individual agents in the generation of habitus" (Moran, 2011, 
p. 66).
	 8.	
Or again: "transformations of the results of an originally intuitive apprehension into a habitus takes place ac­
cording to a general law of conscious life, without our participation, so to speak [...] But it can also be that 
one strives to establish this habitus voluntarily [...] Such an interest will give occasion to repeated running 
through of the explicative synthesis" (Husserl, 1972, p. 123).
	 9.	
Moran continues: "Bourdieu does not fully appreciate that Husserl's account of habituality belongs within his 
overall 'genetic phenomenology'." (2011, p. 70). For more on Bourdieu's relation to phenomenology, see Crossley 
(2001); Throop & Murphy (2002).
	10.	
There are also resources in pragmatism that could lend themselves to this broader institutional conception of 
habit. For example, one could look to Peirce's semiotics (see Legg & Reynolds, 2022), as well as to Dewey and 
Mead's emphasis on social existence. Bourdieu noted that his ideas have "affinities and convergences" with 
Dewey's (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992, p. 122). As Gronow (2012, p. 32) notes, however, this institutional per­
spective "is underdeveloped in pragmatist social theory," although he points to the economist Thorstein Veblen, 
who, influenced by Peirce, and in contrast to neoclassical economics, linked the analyses of action, habit and 
institution (see Gronow, 2008, 2011). In the context of economics these issues have only recently been asso­
ciated with enactivism (Petracca & Gallagher, 2020; Viale et  al., 2023; Frolov, 2024), although, again, the con­
cept of habit remains underdeveloped.
	11.	
As one reviewer has pointed out, in Dreyfus's account of skill development, the rules with which the novice 
might start will gradually disappear with practice, but in a process that resembles sedimentation. That is, the 
rules disappear in their contentful form but  in some sense persist as embedded or embodied in the form of 
readiness to act. The knowledge that is embedded in the initial rules disappears, but never actually goes away. 
It is rather transformed into habit or know-how. This means that sedimentation is not only a process of addi­
tion (layer on layer, as in geology) but also of transformation (as in chemistry).
