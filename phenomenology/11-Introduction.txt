There is increasing recognition in philosophical psychology and cognitive
science that many of our perceptual and cognitive achievements depend
upon couplings between bodily activities and features of the environment.
Recent studies of 'situated' or 'embodied-embedded' cognition are comple-
mented by the works of phenomenologists such as Heidegger and Merleau-
Ponty, which similarly stress the extent to which experience and thought are
shaped by bodily capacities and by our interaction with social and
technological environments. Hence there is considerable potential here for
interdisciplinary interaction between phenomenologists and scientists. The
contributors to this issue of the journal draw on a range of different fields,
including phenomenology, cognitive science, analytic philosophy of mind
and developmental psychology, so as to make a number of mostly comple-
mentary points regarding the situatedness of human experience and
thought.
The first two papers challenge some popular assumptions about the
nature of consciousness. Mark Rowlands remarks on the commonplace
tendency to construe consciousness as object-like and sketches an alterna-
tive account of it as 'revealing activity'. He concludes by suggesting that this
account allows us to better understand the dependence of consciousness
upon bodily capacities and activities; the body can participate in revealing
activity without itself being an object of awareness. Matthew Ratcliffe
criticizes voyeuristic accounts of experience for imposing a misleading
distinction between perception of an 'external' world and perception of
one's 'internal' bodily states. He appeals to the phenomenology of touch, in
order to show that all experience incorporates a sense of relatedness
between body and world, of being inseparable from the situation in which
one finds oneself.
The third paper, by Michael Wheeler, draws on Heidegger's Being and
Time in order to offer a novel and sophisticated solution to the frame prob-
lem. In the process, Wheeler also responds to some objections that have
recently been raised against his approach by Hubert Dreyfus. The next
paper, by Shaun Gallagher, is a critique of conceptions of 'minimal repre-
sentation', which are retained by authors such as Rowlands and Wheeler
who reject more orthodox representationalist approaches. Gallagher argues
that these minimal representations are not 'representations' in any sense of
the term. Wheeler then responds to Gallagher's critique.

The remaining articles are all concerned with interpersonally and socially
situated cognition. Peter Hobson stresses the importance of incorporating a
developmental perspective into the study of intersubjectivity. He draws on
recent studies in developmental psychopathology to argue that thinking
arises in the context of affective interaction between children and care-
givers, and that even mature adult thought processes cannot be wholly
extricated from affective relations between people. Thought is thus 'inter-
personally situated'. Hobson's emphasis on the cognitive centrality of
interpersonal relations is complemented by the next paper, in which Beata
Stawarska discusses the use of indexical or 'deictic' terms such as 'I' and
'you'. These, she suggests, need to be understood in terms of a non-egocen-
tric phenomenology of interpersonal situations, where 'I' and 'you' are
inseparable aspects of an experience. Next is a paper by Daniel Hutto,
which considers the contribution made by narrative competence to
interpersonal understanding. Hutto advocates his 'Narrative Practice
Hypothesis', according to which our ability to attribute reasons for actions
arises from our common exposure to certain kinds of narrative. He then
argues against an alternative view recently proposed by Ratcliffe. This is
followed by Ratcliffe's response. The final paper, by Maria Talero, raises an
important methodological issue. Talero offers a phenomenological study of
the 'experiential workspace', the setting that is constituted by couplings
between an active body and a practically significant environment. She
stresses the intersubjectively permeable, dynamic, open structure of
workspaces and argues that this makes scientific investigation of them
difficult, as attempts to study workspaces are liable to change them.
This collection of papers is based loosely upon the August 2006
conference of the International Association for Phenomenology and the
Cognitive Sciences, which most of the contributors attended. We would like
to thank the British Academy and the Department of Philosophy at
Durham University for supporting the conference.
