Normativity between Naturalism and 
Phenomenology
Thomas J. Spiegel
Department of Philosophy, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany
ABSTRACT
There is an unresolved stand-off between ontological naturalism and phenom­
enological thought regarding the question whether normativity can be reduced 
to physical entities. While the ontological naturalist line of thought is well 
established in analytic philosophy, the phenomenological reasoning for the 
irreducibility of normativity has been largely left ignored by proponents of 
naturalism. Drawing on the work of Husserl, Heidegger, Schütz, Stein and 
others, I reconstruct a phenomenological argument according to which natural 
science (as the foundation of naturalization projects) is itself a part of the 
essentially normative life-world to the effect that ontological naturalism faces 
a bootstrapping problem. I aim to demonstrate that this stand-off is grounded 
in a deep disagreement about the possibility of reduction. I close by arguing 
that this deep disagreement turns on the question which conception about the 
nature of (natural) science is true. This result pits a perfectionist model of 
science (implied by ontological naturalism) against a pragmatist conception 
of science (in favour of the phenomenological argument). The motivation is that 
transforming the disagreement about the controversial principle into 
a disagreement about conceptions of science may help to offer a foundation 
for different attempts at solving the stand-off.

1. Introduction
The question whether normativity is either a genuine feature of the world or 
reducible is of central importance to both ontological naturalists and the 
phenomenological tradition. Resistance against ontological naturalism 
within the tradition of analytic philosophy has been growing in the last few 
decades. The main strategy of critics of different forms of naturalism ('scien­
tific', 'ontological', 'methodological', 'strict') is to offer a different kind of 
non-reductive naturalism ('liberal naturalism', 'relaxed naturalism', 'soft 
naturalism', 'naïve naturalism', 'Aristotelian naturalism', 'near-naturalism',

'subject naturalism') that countenances normativity as a genuine part of the 
world. Apart from this more recent line of critique, the phenomenological 
tradition has been critical of any kind of reductive naturalism virtually since 
its inception,1 but has provoked fewer responses than the aforementioned 
non-reductive forms of naturalism stemming from the analytic tradition. 
This paper deals with a dialectical stand-off between these two parties 
regarding the question whether normativity is reducible to entities amenable 
to physical inquiry. As such, this paper will focus on reductive forms of 
(ontological) naturalism and simply omit debate on non-reductive, or liberal 
forms of naturalism (Spiegel 2022). At the heart of this stand-off lies the 
question, as will be demonstrated, whether the so-called life-world itself is 
fundamental in the sense that it figures as a transcendental enabling condi­
tion for science as such (as the phenomenologist asserts), or whether nat­
uralism can bootstrap itself out of this predicament.
Forms of naturalism are common and popular in contemporary philoso­
phy. Large swathes of the debate have been dominated by Moore's open 
question argument (Moore 1903, §13). However, another more recent strand 
of the debate is informed more directly by ontological naturalism as is a form 
of physicalism according to which everything that exists must be physical in 
some sense. Forms of ontological naturalism have been given exemplary 
expression in Sellars' scientia mensura dictum: 'science is the measure of all 
things, of what it is that it is, and of what is not that it is not' (Sellars 1997, 
§41).2 One of the greatest challenges for ontological naturalism comes in the 
form of placement problems (Price 2013): hard-to-place phenomena like 
morality, rationality, normativity and mental properties seemingly do not fit 
into a physicalist landscape. This sets the stage for so-called naturalization 
projects which aim to demonstrate (usually by way of reduction, elimination 
or supervenience relations) that the hard-to-place phenomena turn out to be 
physical in some sense after all.3 Indeed, as Robert Audi remarks, contem­
porary 'philosophy is witnessing an age of naturalization projects' (Audi  
2012, 169). Ontological naturalists thus commonly believe that normative 
concepts pose in principle no problem for the project of naturalization (e.g. 
Jackson 1998; Searle 1995; List and Pettit 2011) because future-ideal physics 
will be able to convincingly demonstrate that normative facts reduce to 
physical facts (e.g. Ney 2008; Papineau 2009; Kim 2005).
However, before the current shape of ontological naturalism rose to 
prominence and before opposition to it in form of different liberalized, non- 
1Bergson succinctly stated already in 1898 in that naturalism is merely 'unaware metaphysics, which is 
presented to the ignorant under the mask of science' (Bergson 2006, 83).
2Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, is usually traced back to Quine's proclamation that 
philosophy is continuous with science (Quine 1960, 209).
3(Putnam (2004), 70) is even lead to state that ontological naturalism is motivated 'by a horror of the 
normative'.

reductive naturalisms took foothold, thinkers in the phenomenological tra­
dition have already objected to ontological naturalism. Such thinkers have 
steadfastly resisted any such attempt at naturalization insofar it means doing 
away with something that phenomenologists deem a genuine part of reality 
insofar it is a direct part of our experience. For example, Husserl writes that 
'only blindness to the transcendental, as it is experienceable and knowable 
only through phenomenological reduction, makes the revival of physicalism 
in our time possible [. . .]' (Husserl 1970, §72, p. 265). Much later, partially as 
a result of his engagement with Heidegger, Husserl formulates the key 
phenomenological idea that natural science, on which such reductive phy­
sicalism is dependent, is itself merely a part of an irreducible life-world. And 
this, mutatis mutandis, amounts to the idea that normativity itself cannot be 
naturalized by way of physicalist reduction.
Hence, naturalists and phenomenologists are diametrically opposed 
regarding the status of normativity. There has been some engagement 
between these traditions in recent decades. The majority of these contribu­
tions, however, have dealt with the question whether something like 
a naturalized phenomenology is possible (Moran 2013; Zahavi 2013). But 
there has been no focus on the question whether the phenomenological 
tradition has resources to offer a counter-weight against naturalization 
projects. There is still space to study the relationship between the naturalistic 
and phenomenological framework, as these two traditions may perhaps be 
viewed as prime competitors which are actually not much interested in what 
the other has to say. It sometimes seems instead that these traditions develop 
like two parallel lines which are, for the most part, content never to intersect. 
Part of what makes answering the question about normativity difficult is an 
apparent lack of engagements with this problem from the naturalist side 
although iterations of the phenomenological argument go back at least to the 
beginning of the 20th century. This is perhaps partially due to the dominance 
of analytic approaches and partially due to the fact that some phenomenol­
ogists have rarely articulated their arguments for the irreducibility of nor­
mativity in a way that is accessible for 'outsiders'.4 A reconstruction and re- 
appreciation can re-affirm a way of resisting ontological naturalism which 
comes 'outside' the current framework of non-reductive naturalisms.
In this paper, I aim to unite these two sides in argument. To that end, this 
paper pursues two aims, one interpretive, one systematic. The interpretive 
aim is to make sense of the anti-reductive sensibilities regarding normativity 
4For example, in an otherwise excellent treatment of Dilthey's philosophy of science, Robert Scharff 
simply asserts the picture is to be rejected that 'natural scientists (and the traditional epistemologists 
who speak for them) conduct their affairs as explanation-seeking, disembodied minds that have been 
resolutely stripped of their real vitality and reduced to ahistorical subject-knowers' (Scharff 2019, 129). 
While this presents a succinct expression of the main idea of the phenomenological argument, it is 
likely that just an assertion of this idea will not convince any doubters.

shared by a number of influential phenomenologists by way of capturing 
these sensibilities in argument form. The systematic aim is to investigate how 
the stand-off between phenomenological and naturalist intuitions can be 
resolved. Rather than giving a straight solution, I argue that this question 
turns on another, broader matter. Whether normativity is reducible depends 
on whether naturalization projects can be 'purged' of normativity; but this in 
turn depends on what conception of science is correct. The overall trajectory 
of this paper is modest: it tries to clarify the respective positions and specific 
points of contention between the two sides of the argument. And it argues 
that in trying to find the correct answer to this question, we have to start 
looking elsewhere at a 'broader picture', namely at the nature of (natural) 
science - assumptions about which often are implicitly invested in debates 
regarding the reduction of normativity.
Some preliminary remarks are in order. Firstly, it is sometimes 
stated that one of the defining features of phenomenology as 
a methodology is its priority over metaphysics in the sense that it 
brackets metaphysical questions about certain objects in order to pay 
actual 'attention to the phenomenon under study' (Gallagher and 
Zahavi 2008, 6). This general rule certainly has to be specified in 
each context, however. The phenomenological argument reconstructed 
here is such a specification of this general rule: an argument that can 
demonstrate why one is entitled to look at normative phenomena in 
a way that is prior to metaphysical theorizing, and thereby logically 
prior to reductive efforts. Furthermore, the trajectory of this paper will 
thus be controversial in the sense that readings of Husserl (and others) 
differ with regard to the overall stance of ontology. The main differ­
ence in viewing the life-world as prior to the sciences is methodological 
versus ontological. A methodological interpretation of the priority of 
the lifeworld states that the life-world is the fundamental way of 
'access' to any world, yet that the natural sciences can still find out 
what is ontologically fundamental. For example, Berghofer (2022) 
writes that there is 'no reason why phenomenologists should be obli­
gated to deny' such an ontological priority of, say, physics (cf. also 
Berghofer 2020, 23). By contrast, the ontological reading states that the 
life-world is ontologically fundamental such that the theories of the 
natural science do not provide ontologically fundamental entities 'sub­
structed' to the life-world. For example, Trizio (2020, 299) calls it an 
'ontological mistake', going back to Galileo, to assume that the results 
of the mathematized physical sciences constitute a kind of true beyond 
to the life-world.5 Arguing for either interpretation is well beyond the

scope of this paper6 which is why for the sake of this paper, I shall 
presuppose the ontological reading of the priority claim. In other 
words, if the methodological reading were to be true, there would be 
no stand-off regarding normativity between ontological naturalism and 
phenomenology as such.
Secondly, the concept of normativity is familiar, yet not always easy to pin 
down. I use the term 'normativity' here loosely in order to allude to the whole 
realm of matters in which correct and incorrect, right and wrong can play 
a role. This means the whole domain of interpersonal social phenomena, 
from I-Thou relations to complex social institutions like nation states involve 
some form of normativity. Phenomenologists are often not wont to using the 
terms 'normative' or 'normativity'.7 Some phenomenologists may, never­
theless, prefer to speak of 'second person' or the 'Other'. There are obviously 
manifold conceptual differentiations and types of normativity since von 
Wright's seminal Norm and Action (1963) and it would be impossible to 
do these debates justice without entirely derailing this paper.
Third, some who call themselves naturalists will not feel represented by 
what is called 'ontological naturalism' (or sometimes 'scientific naturalism') 
in the debate. Some will feel, for example, that they still deserve the 'honorary 
badge' of being called 'naturalist' in virtue of endorsing something weaker 
than ontological naturalism. Weaker forms of naturalism have been called 
'modest naturalism' which consists in (i) respect for science, (ii) rejection of 
philosophical foundationalism, and (iii) rejection of supernaturalism (magic, 
witches, ghosts, goblins) (De Caro and Macarthur 2004). To be clear: modest 
naturalism is not the kind of naturalism in question in this context since its 
content is not potent enough to underwrite a controversial forms of natur­
alism that aims to reduce normativity. Whether or not endorsing a modest 
form of naturalism is sufficient for being allowed into the naturalist club is 
6There are a few reasons why I am prone to hold that the epistemological reading is problematic. One 
such reason is that granting physics ontological priority seems to be in tension with the transcendental 
elements of phenomenology as transcendental intuitions about the priority of (some aspects of) Geist 
are usually seen as incompatible with any kind of materialist view of the world espoused by ontological 
naturalism. A second potential problem relates to the endorsement of Berghofer (2022) just cited. On 
the one hand, Berghofer states that physics has or may have ontological priority over the life-world. On 
the other hand, he states that Husserl - and it seems by extension Berghofer himself - rejects 
ontological naturalism, i.e. the idea that only 'what is governed by the empirical sciences can be 
real' (p. 285). The potential problem is that if one grants ontological priority to physics, then one has to 
claim at least that physical entities are ontologically fundamental. But if non-physical entities are less 
fundamental, one has to account in which sense they are equally real as the physical entities they, say, 
supervene on. The danger in claiming that physical entities are fundamental is that one divides reality 
into real and somewhat less real entities. This is, of course, analogous to Huw Price's critique of object 
naturalism which divides the world into 'first class' and 'economy class' passengers (i.e. entities).
7One of the main reasons is that the term 'normativity' does not originate in the phenomenological 
tradition, but has rather been a staple of the analytic tradition. The second reason is that the way in 
which the term 'normativity' is used suggests some form of objectifying sideways-on view onto 
normative phenomena, i.e. a methodological approach onto such phenomena that suggests that 
they can be viewed from the 'outside'.

a matter to be kept separate here - this paper mainly operates with the 
relatively demanding notion of ontological naturalism (cf. part 1).
The roadmap is then this: I will first provide a birds-eye overview of a part 
of the dialectical situation regarding projects aimed at naturalizing normativity 
in part one. The second part reconstructs what I call the phenomenological 
argument, based off different expressions by prominent figures of seemingly 
the same idea: that (natural) science itself is part of the life-world. And since 
science is part of the life-world, which itself is normative, the results of natural 
science, most notably those of a future-ideal physics, necessitate a form of 
genuine normativity. I then argue that this stand-off exemplifies a deep dis­
agreement about a controversial principle about the impossibility of reduction 
that does heavy lifting in the phenomenological argument. I close by suggest­
ing that whether and how this question is resolved depends on which concep­
tion of science is correct.
2. A Generalized Naturalist Treatment of Normativity
Ontological naturalists treat normativity as something that needs to be 
naturalized as it is not part of nature as such. Naturalization projects can 
typically take the shape of reduction (e.g. Jackson 1998; Millikan 2000; 
Brandom 1994) or supervenience (Lewis 1983; Stoljar 2010; Ridge 2012), 
and elimination (Churchland 1981). While the reductionist and superveni­
ence accounts of aim to solve the placement problems by identifying norma­
tivity as something ultimately physical, eliminativist accounts would aim to 
demonstrate that normativity does not exist simpliciter.
Some popular forms of ontological naturalism are supervenience-based. 
For the context of this paper, these supervenience-based approaches are not 
primarily relevant. This is for two reasons. First, supervenience-based onto­
logical naturalism faces some difficult challenges (cf. Fodor 1974; Horgan  
1993; Buekens 2018) including critiques of bridge laws (von Kutschera 2011). 
The more important, second reason is, however, that supervenience-based 
ontological naturalism is not sufficiently demanding in order to constitute 
a position that could not also be held by critics of naturalism. Of course, even 
supervenience-based ontological naturalism would be anathema to a classical 
substance dualist. Yet, even card-carrying non-naturalists like, for example, 
John McDowell or Thomas Nagel, as well as a number of phenomenologists, 
could endorse supervenience-based ontological naturalism without contra­
dicting their other philosophical convictions. This is because the idea that 
normative (and mental) properties supervene on physical properties is not 
very demanding in and of itself. Reduction-based ontological naturalism 
admittedly faces problems as well, yet these challenges can be reasonably 
set aside in this context in order to take the reductive claim itself seriously. 
Therefore, the kind of ontological naturalism that is relevant to the context of 
498
T. J. SPIEGEL

this paper is reductive-based, i.e. the idea that normative features of the 
world are nothing over-and-above physical features.
There has been a steadfast defiance against the naturalization of norma­
tivity. Critiques of ontological naturalism (i.e. physicalism) and its treatment 
of normativity come in different forms. One traditional line of argument is, 
for example, to attack the metaphysical reduction relation directly as unsui­
table. Another principled and general argument, however, is that the main 
problem for ontological naturalism lies in the fact that current physics does 
not provide a theoretical basis which is sufficient to demonstrate that things 
like normativity and the mind turn out to be nothing but physical them­
selves. This latter argument leads to a specification of ontological naturalism: 
It is not current, but future-ideal physics which provides to foundation on 
which normativity (and other phenomena like the mind) can be naturalized.
On what grounds can the ontological naturalist defer to a future-ideal 
physics of which we know nothing yet? There are typically two related 
arguments for this: the success argument and the miracle argument. The 
success argument is neatly expressed in the following statements:
"So what are the fruits of naturalism? First, the scientific enterprise has 
a remarkably successful history, and naturalism is little more than 
a statement of our continued support for that enterprise." (Colyvan 2008, 
307; italics Author)
"Commitment to the method [of natural science] can be sufficiently justified 
by appealing to past successes at finding naturalistic explanations [. . .]. One 
might argue even that the success rate has been going up for the past 300 
years." (Giere 2000, 214f.; italics Author)
"[. . .] even if naturalism depends on metaphysical assumptions, the naturalist 
can argue that the metaphysical assumptions in question are vindicated by the 
success of science, by contrast with the metaphysical assumptions on which 
autonomous metaphysics is based which are not vindicated by the success of 
metaphysics since it can claim no such success." (Ladyman and Ross 2007, 7; 
italics Author)
The success arguments states that since natural science can boast an unpre­
cedented history of success, a commitment to ontological naturalism (relying 
on a future-ideal physics) is justified. Adjusted to the context of normativity, 
the past successes of natural science, as it were, should give us a justified 
confidence that future-ideal physics will be able to provide a metaphysical 
framework for a full naturalization of normativity (among other things).
The success argument is closely related, yet not identical to the more 
familiar miracle argument. The miracle argument dates back to Hilary 
Putnam's earlier work:
"The positive argument for realism is that it is the only philosophy that doesn't 
make the success of science a miracle. That terms in mature scientific theories 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
499

typically refer [. . .], that the theories accepted in a mature science are typically 
approximately true, that the same term can refer to the same thing even when 
it occurs in different theories - these statements are viewed by the scientific 
realist not as necessary truths but as part of the only scientific explanation of 
the success of science, and hence as part of any adequate scientific description 
of science and its relations to its objects." (Putnam 1975, 73)
The miracle argument is restated in an even more impassioned manner by 
arguably naturalism's most fervent proponent Alexander Rosenberg:
"The reason we trust physics to be scientism's metaphysics is its track record of 
fantastically powerful explanation, prediction, and technological application. If 
what physics says about reality doesn't go, that track record would be a totally 
inexplicable mystery or coincidence. [. . .] The no-miracles and inference-to- 
the-best-explanation arguments are on the right track. Their alternatives are 
obviously mistaken." (Rosenberg 2014, 19)
The miracle argument states that the best explanation for the explanatory 
success of the natural sciences is that natural-scientific theories are true and 
refer to entities that really do exist (against, say, instrumentalist accounts like 
Van Fraasen 1980). Rosenberg even adds that any alternative is 'obviously 
mistaken'. Adjusted to the current context, the miracle argument lends 
support to the idea that the explanatory track-record of the natural science 
is so well-established and documented that an ontological naturalist would 
be justified in assuming that the success of physics converges on an account 
of reality which can serve as a basis for the naturalization of normativity, 
even if such an account is still forthcoming.
There are at least two ways in which an opponent of ontological natural­
ism could proceed here, both of which the ontological naturalist will find 
wholly unconvincing. The first way of responding would simply be to 
double-down on specific critiques of metaphysical relations of reduction or 
supervenience in an attempt to discredit the ontological naturalist's preferred 
philosophical devices. Naturalists could either simply ignore such criticism 
or refine their accounts of reduction or supervenience further into a specific 
brand that does not fall prey to the anti-naturalist sentiment. Considering the 
relatively high amount of different supervenience accounts, this dialectical 
cat-and-mouse game has been going on for quite some time.
The second rebuttal is about the status of the appeal to future-ideal 
physics as a promise. An opponent of ontological naturalism could perhaps 
dig their heels in and simply state that if the ontological naturalist can 
promise that in the future, accounts of naturalization will be fully vindicated 
by the empirical natural sciences, then the opponent, too, can promise that 
future developments in philosophical thought will be able to provide ade­
quate counter-arguments against the naturalistic promise. For example, an 
opponent of ontological naturalism could perhaps simply counter-promise 
500
T. J. SPIEGEL

that future-ideal physics would support an emergentist account of norma­
tivity, running counter to naturalization efforts.
It is doubtful that an ontological naturalist would find such rebuttals 
convincing. Firstly, arguments attacking supervenience and reduction have 
not caused the philosophical community to abandon such endeavours, but 
have rather motivated physicalists to come up with more refined versions. It 
seems to be the case that ontological naturalists will want to hold onto the 
physicalist picture, no matter what the opposition states. It is even more 
doubtful that naturalistically minded philosophers would take a counter- 
promise of the kind alluded to above seriously, especially since, they might 
claim, philosophy has no such comparable success to offer. It is more likely 
that naturalists will still view their optimism in future-ideal physics 
vindicated.
While this assumption is not without its challenges, we shall go forward 
with this reinforced notion reduction-based ontological naturalism because 
it presents the greater challenge for a phenomenological argument that aims 
to vindicate a genuine status of normativity. What, then, would it take to 
provide a proper argument against ontological naturalism, an argument that 
has potential to undercut the optimism for a future-ideal account of physics 
which serves to vindicate current naturalization projects? Such an argument 
would have to operate on a more fundamental level. The next section is 
dedicated to demonstrating that the phenomenological tradition has the 
resources to establish such an argument.
3. The Phenomenological Argument
Many thinkers in the phenomenological tradition have been critical of 
naturalism and the scientific image as a whole. It is a peculiar undertaking 
to ascribe anything more specific than that to the different, specific thinkers 
in the broad, multifaceted tradition of phenomenology. This is due to the 
different influences, aims, and intellectual ramifications special to thinkers 
like Husserl, Stein, Heidegger, Levinas, Ricoeur, or Merleau-Ponty. This 
caveat notwithstanding, a large part of this critical attitude is rooted in the 
idea of life-world as something more fundamental than the domain of 
science. The main assumption is that science (and a fortiori natural science) 
is merely a part of the life-world as a whole. This idea in turn is closely related 
to the idea constitutive of the phenomenological tradition that the first- 
person perspective qua experiential character is irreducibly sui generis.8 
The phenomenon of normativity (the realm of the first, second, and third 
8This idea is not exclusive to the phenomenological tradition, however. Thinkers like Anscombe (1957) 
and Perry (1979) have argued in different ways that the first-person perspective is irreducible, albeit for 
different reasons and with different motivations.

person together in the life-world broadly understood) can then be viewed as 
an extension of the irreducibility of the first-person perspective. One diffi­
culty is that such an argument itself is rarely fully worked out by thinkers in 
the phenomenological tradition, at least not to a degree to which the oppos­
ing naturalists would find it plausible or worthy of consideration. In this part, 
I shall first gather and reconstruct phrasings of the thought that normativity 
is irreducibly part of life-world somehow. I will then show how this thought 
relates to ontological naturalism, more specifically, how this thought can be 
elaborated into an argument against ontological naturalism.9 There are two 
necessary caveats in order. The first caveat is that Husserl's concept of the 
life-world as garnered more scholarly attention than can be reasonably 
accounted for in this paper (e.g. Hyder and Rheinberger 2010). The second 
caveat is that the authors cited over the course of the following pages - 
Husserl, Schütz, Heidegger, Stein, Schmitz, Zahavi - are all engaged in vastly 
different projects, despite being key figures in the phenomenological tradi­
tion. The point of this part is to argue that despite their differences, they 
might share an underlying fundamental idea regarding the relationship of 
science and the life-world even though it may be expressed in very different 
contexts and styles. If the idea of the life-world should, in what follows, 
remain somewhat 'vague' by some standards, this is perhaps a necessary 
feature of this concept which Husserl himself acknowledged (Husserl  
1970, §33).
Husserl outlines in his Krisis the following relation between the sciences 
and his idea of life-world:
"It is, of course, the one world of experience, common to all, that Einstein and 
every other researcher knows he is in as a human being, even throughout all his 
activity of research." (Husserl 1970, §34b, 125f.)
Husserl asserts that the sciences 'build upon' the life-world by utilizing parts 
of it. Using Einstein and Michelson as exemplary scientists, Husserl adds that 
that a life-world shared by the scientists engaging one another is the condi­
tion ('Voraussetzung') for any kind of objective research. In all their research 
activity, researchers 
remain part of the 
world of experience 
('Erfahrungswelt'). What is life-world in Husserl's technical sense? He 
describes it as follows:
"The life-world is a realm of original self-evidences. That which is self- 
evidently given is, in perception, experienced as 'the thing itself,' in immediate 
presence, or, in memory, remembered as the thing itself. All conceivable 
verification leads back to these modes of self-evidence [. . .]." (Husserl 1970, 
§34d, 127f.)
9Variations of this idea have also been proposed by some who are not card-carrying phenomenologists, 
e.g. Peels (2017, 7), Habermas (2004), Baker (2017), Murdoch (2001, 33), Tetens (2015) (32 f.),

According to Husserl, the life-world is the immediately self-evident. All 
conceivable justification harkens back, eventually, to the self-evidences of 
the life-world; it is, in other words, the source of all justification. This holds, 
a fortiori, all scientific justification. Husserl is very explicit about this:
"As we already know, physicists, who are men like other men, who know 
themselves as living in the life-world, the world of their human interests, have, 
under the title of physics, a particular sort of questions and (in a broader sense) 
practical projects directed toward the things of the life-world, and their 
'theories' are the practical results.". (Husserl 1970, 140)
Physics here is taken as a pars pro toto for all science. Even the sciences are in 
this very sense dependent on human practice as mediated by the life-world.
This fundamental idea has been taken up and further developed by 
students of Husserl. Alfred Schütz adopts Husserl's idea of the life-world, 
recoins it as Alltagswelt (i.e. the world of everyday life, also: Welt des 
Wirkens), and uses it as one of the foundational pillars of his phenomen­
ological sociology. The world of everyday life (or life-world) is 'the world 
[. . .] within which I and you, Peter and Paul, anyone and everyone have 
confused and ineffable perceptions, act, work, plan, worry, hope, are born, 
grow up and will die - in a word, live their life as unbroken selves in their full 
humanity' (Schütz 1962, 255). Schütz argues that life-world constitutes 
a 'paramount' reality (Schütz 1962, 341) under which other domains - 
among them the domain of science - are somehow subordinated or, at the 
very least, continuous. Accordingly he writes:
"The finite provinces of meaning are not separated states of mental life in the 
sense that passing from one to another would require a transmigration of the 
soul and a complete extinction of memory and consciousness by death [. . .]. 
They are merely names for different tensions of one and the same conscious­
ness, and it is the same life, the mundane life, unbroken from birth to death, 
which is attended to in different modifications." (Schütz 1962, 257f)
Schütz is opposed to the idea that human life is a conglomerate of entirely 
autonomously disjoint domains, not as 'separated states of mental life'. The 
paradox of communication concerns the transposition or crossing over from 
one domain to another: if such domains of the life-world were starkly 
separated, the 'communication' between such domains would not be possi­
ble. To use an example that is directly relevant for the current context: the 
person coaching a middle school soccer team on Tuesday night does not 
enter an entirely new domain when he puts on a lab coat on Wednesday 
morning to grow bacteria cultures as part of his biology graduate program. 
These different domains are united under and different expressions of 
a unifying life-world. In such different contexts, the 'same consciousness' is 
in different tensions; it is not that different consciousnesses are going in and 
out of existence when transgressing different domains of the life-world. So

the fact that we can move between different social domains (religion, the as-if 
word of games, science) seamlessly is made possible by the fact that these 
domains are grounded always already in the life-world as 'paramount reality'. 
And it is obviously of the highest importance for Schütz that the life-world is 
permeated by social relations between a multitude of subjects (i.e. norma­
tivity) since his life's work is the development of a genuinely phenomenolo­
gical approach to sociology.
While Schütz is the student of Husserl who perhaps made most of this 
idea, similar, yet less elaborate remarks on this matter can be found in 
Heidegger's early and late thought. In Being and Time (Husserl 2001) he 
writes:
"The basic structures of any such area [science, TJS] have already been worked 
out after a fashion in our pre-scientific ways of experiencing and interpreting 
that domain of Being in which the areas of subject-matter is itself confined." 
(Heidegger 1962, 29)
While Heidegger is not as concerned here with the relationship between 
science, Being and Dasein as he is in his later work, this quote already 
expresses the idea that Heidegger takes there to be a kind of natural con­
tinuity between pre-scientific understanding and the domain of institutio­
nalized science. In his Age of the Worldpicture (Heidegger 1977) Heidegger 
aims to analyse the 'essence' of modern science and modernity as such. In 
this context he identifies constant activity (Betrieb) as one of its essential 
features:
"For the character of modern science is determined by a third fundamental 
occurrence: constant activity [Betrieb]. By this term is to be understood, first of 
all, that phenomenon whereby a science, whether natural or humanistic, in 
order to achieve proper recognition today as a science is required to be capable 
of being institutionalized. Research is not, however, constant activity because 
its work is carried out in institutions; rather, institutions are necessary because 
science, as, intrinsically, research, has the character of constant activity. [. . .] 
That character however is the inner ground for the necessity of its institutional 
character." (Heidegger 2002, 63f.)
Heidegger asserts that the institutionalization of scientific research is neces­
sary for the existence of modern science as such. While he does not explicitly 
state it, institutionalization and professionalization of science (Wissenschaft) 
imply a certain degree of sociality which is not implicit in the idea of the 
scholar (Gelehrter) which he puts in contrast with the researcher of constant 
activity.
And even Husserl's other key student, Edith Stein, states at the very 
beginning of her On the Problem of Empathy that 'research in natural science' 
is the 'continuation' of 'natural experience' (Stein 1964, 4). Natural science is, 
as it were, somehow embedded in or continuous with natural, everyday 
504
T. J. SPIEGEL

experience of the world. Although Stein does not elaborate much on this idea 
(let alone provide a justification for this intuition), it is perhaps among the 
more lucid expression of the idea of the primacy of the life-world over 
science in this tradition.
These students of Husserl (Stein, Heidegger, Schütz) are also seconded by 
more recent scholars of phenomenology. Dan Zahavi states that we 'cannot 
look sideways at our experiences in order to see to what extent they match 
with reality' (Zahavi 2019, 28) and asserts:
"As Merleau-Ponty insists, however, we should never forget that our knowl­
edge of the world, including our scientific knowledge, arises from a bodily 
anchored first-person perspective, and that science would be meaningless 
without this experiential dimension. The scientific discourse is rooted in the 
world of experience, in the experiential world, and if we wish to comprehend 
the performance and limits of science, we should investigate the original 
experience of the world of which science is a higher-order articulation." 
(Zahavi 2019, 66)
Zahavi reiterates with Merleau-Ponty that the origin of the third-personal 
scientific knowledge is intertwined with the first-person perspective. All 
scientific practice requires the dimension of 'first-personal and necessarily 
pre-scientific experience' of the people engaging in scientific research. This is 
to the effect that the third-personal results of science - their immense value 
and impressiveness notwithstanding - presuppose a kind of 'original experi­
ence' of the world. This world referenced by Zahavi is the same life-world 
from above, that is, the world that includes many different subjects and their 
normative interrelations.
It is time to pause and take stock of the ideas expressed in these different 
quotes by prominent phenomenologists. We can find two interrelated ideas 
there. The first idea is that the life-world (including the multitude of first- 
person perspectives) is irreducible and sui generis. This is one of the central 
ideas of the phenomenological tradition. The second idea is that science as 
such, most notably natural science, is in some important sense a part of that 
life-world or an extension of the life-world (despite all of science's particular 
features), and does not constitute a kind of privileged domain in total 
opposition to ordinary experience. In other words, the 'life-world is also 
the world from which the world projected in the natural sciences arises [. . .]' 
(Kerzsberg 2010, 225). These two points are related. The idea is that science 
itself is permeated by normativity in virtue of being grounded in some 
important sense in the life-world. The thought that science itself is part of 
the life-world can be viewed as an elaboration and extension of the thought 
that the I or first person itself cannot be naturalized.
How does this relate to the question regarding naturalization and onto­
logical naturalism? Using these interrelated ideas, one can construct an 
argument directed against the reductive naturalization attempts of 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES

ontological naturalism: Science as an institution itself is a part of the life- 
world - this is the phenomenological thesis defended by Husserl, Schütz, 
Stein, Heidegger and others. The life-world is essentially normative (even 
though 'normative' is perhaps not their preferred term). Therefore, science as 
an institution is essentially normative. And since science as an institution is 
just part of the life-world, then the results of science are a part of the life- 
world. The results of science are the foundation for naturalization projects. 
Yet, the results of science are essentially normative. Therefore, the founda­
tion for naturalization projects as such are essentially normative. And if the 
foundation for naturalization projects is essentially normative, then natur­
alization projects are inconsistent.
This inconsistency begins by noting that naturalizing normativity neces­
sarily requires the results of natural science, most notably those of physics. 
The results of the natural sciences themselves require science as a social 
institution. By trying to naturalize normativity on the grounds of the results 
of the natural sciences (i.e. theories and theses of physics), naturalization 
projects are designed to naturalize that what would enable naturalization of 
anything in the first place. The overall conclusion then is that normativity is 
essential, i.e. it cannot be 'naturalized away' in any reductive or eliminative 
effort.
1. The life-world is an enabling condition for there to be science as an 
institution. [phenomenological intuition]
2. The life-world is normative. [phenomenological intuition]
3. If x is normative and if x is the enabling condition for y, then y is 
normative.
4. Therefore, science as an institution is normative.
5. Science as an institution is the enabling condition for there to be 
scientific theories at all.
6. Therefore, scientific theories are normative.
7. Scientific theories are presupposed by naturalization projects.
8. If scientific theories are presupposed by naturalization projects and if 
scientific theories are normative, then naturalization projects presuppose 
normativity.
9. Therefore, naturalization projects presuppose normativity.
10. Naturalization projects reduce normativity.
11. If x presupposes y, then y cannot be reduced to x. [controversial 
principle]
12. Naturalization projects cannot reduce normativity.
13. If naturalization projects cannot reduce normativity, then naturaliza­
tion projects necessarily fail.
14. Therefore, naturalization projects necessarily fail.
15. If naturalization projects necessarily fail, then normativity is irreduci­
ble to non-normative properties.
506
T. J. SPIEGEL

16. Normativity is irreducible to non-normative properties.
The argument itself could certainly be abridged while retaining its force. 
However, a long-form reconstruction of this kind serves to make explicit 
important and pervasive assumptions seemingly at play regarding the redu­
cibility of normativity. It should be noted, starting off, that the argument 
seems to be valid at least. Due charity compels us to construe the phenom­
enological argument as valid if it is to be in the vein of the phenomenological 
thinkers previously discussed.
Furthermore, the argument can not only be understood as phenomeno­
logical, but simultaneously as transcendental. While it is controversial how 
exactly transcendental arguments are to be understood, this phenomenolo­
gical argument features at least two key aspects of transcendental arguments. 
The first aspect is that some of its premises include enabling conditions.10 
Enabling conditions are akin to what Stern (2000) calls 'transcendental 
conditionals' according to which 'x is only possible if y'. The second aspect 
is that it centres on some aspect of reality being genuine; this is analogous to 
how Strawson's transcendental argument against skepticism concludes that 
external objects exist (cf. Strawson 2011). Qua transcendental status, the 
phenomenological argument will face the additional burdens that normally 
beset transcendental arguments. However, in order not to dilute the focus, 
I shall not discuss the transcendental status further as debating this aspect 
would require its own dedicated investigation (cf. Pihlström 2001).
Moving forward, the argument can be divided in two parts. The first part 
spans statement 1. through 9. and is arguably not very controversial (save for 
the transcendental enabling conditions. The second, controversial part 
begins with statement 10. All the way through the overall conclusion 16. It 
is the second, controversial part that will become relevant for the rest of this 
paper.
The first part is mainly comprised of phenomenological intuitions which 
even a reductive naturalist might share.For example, rejecting 1. and 2. 
would require the naturalist to tell a long and probably very counter- 
intuitive story why science as an institution does not require people doing 
science (ad. 1.) or why there are no normative properties at all (ad. 2.). There 
are indeed some forms of naturalism, namely eliminativism, which would 
claim that norms do not exist full stop. But eliminativism is a far less popular 
and compelling form of naturalism than its reductive counterpart, therefore 
making it a less attractive interlocutor. It seems that it is not controversial 
that there are norms or that science involves practical activity, but rather 
which methodological and/or ontological inferences can be drawn from such 
facts.But a full appreciation and discussion of this idea would require its own

paper. While perhaps not entirely uncontroversial, it shall suffice to say that 
this idea has at least influential proponents, mainly those in the pragmatist 
tradition (Dewey 1938; Putnam 1994), constructivist tradition (e,g. 
Mittelstraß 1973; Kambartel 1974), but also in analytic philosophy (e.g. 
Resnik 2008). Given 8., at least prima facie, the idea that scientific theories 
are intimately connected with normative considerations in a relevant way, is 
not preposterous. Furthermore, a naturalist may not even take issue with this 
since he or she can admit that naturalization projects presuppose normativity 
without contradiction.
4. A Deep Disagreement about Reduction?
The second part of the argument, however, features at least one premise 
which the reductive naturalist will want to disavow and reject statement 
11. which I dub the 'controversial principle':
[Controversial principle]: If x presupposes y, then y cannot be reduced to x
This principle expresses the central point of contention between phenom­
enologists and reductive naturalists.11 Adjusted for our context, it trans­
lates to something like 'If scientific theories presuppose normative 
properties, then normative properties cannot be reduced to scientific 
theories'. The variables in this principle can of course also be assigned 
different contexts, such as 'if sets presuppose numbers, then numbers 
cannot be reduced to sets' (regardless whether this is true). This would 
mean, for example, that if it turns out that it cannot be true that numbers 
are nothing over-and-above sets, Another example from social ontology, 
in particular the individualism-holism debate, would be: 'If the existence 
of individuals presupposes social groups, then social groups cannot be 
reduced to individuals', thereby expressing a holist intuition.
While the naturalist may have no issue accepting that scientific theories 
presuppose normativity, he or she will have to fight this principle tooth- 
and-nail. This is because this principle prevents any reductive ambitions the 
naturalist has towards normativity. Conversely, this principle is what sets 
apart the phenomenological argument against the reducibility of normativity 
as particularly radical. This principle is what the phenomenologist has to 
assert in order to give his or her argument a transcendental, non-reductive 
bite since it determines that the life-world qua genuine normativity is 
fundamental for scientific theories in a manner that makes it impossible 
An anonymous referee has correctly pointed out that it would be preferable to have a list of authors 
who either overtly endorse or reject the controversial principle. But part of the main issue is that this 
is an underlying commitment that is rarely, if ever, openly expressed, yet motivates the philosophical 
positions that lead to the stand-off between naturalists and phenomenologists on normativity.

for naturalization projects to claim that normativity be nothing 'over-and- 
above' the physical.
The situation so far seems to be this: naturalist accounts of normativity 
must rely on results of the natural sciences (mostly a form of future-ideal 
physics) in order to reduce normative properties to non-normative, physical 
properties. Against this, the phenomenological argument suggests that the 
results of the natural sciences themselves are normative in virtue of science as 
a holon of socio-normative relations enabling natural sciences in the first 
place. This turns on the question whether natural science presupposing 
normativity makes the natural sciences and their results themselves fraught 
with normativity in a way that does not allow for its reduction - this was 
expressed in the controversial principle featuring as statement 11. in the 
phenomenological argument.
This point can be recast in a famous metaphor. According to the phe­
nomenological argument, like Baron Münchhausen stuck waist-deep in 
a bog, the natural sciences are steeped in the 'normative swamp' of the life- 
world (cf. Nietzsche 2001, 21). And just like Baron Münchhausen tries to pull 
himself out of the swamp by his own hair, the naturalist tries to pull herself 
out of the life-world by the results of the (future-ideal) physics which itself is 
not outside the swamp, according to the phenomenological argument. Less 
metaphorically, bootstrapping amounts to the idea that ontological naturalist 
accounts of normativity can simply, as it were, naturalize the normative 
features of the natural-scientific research which provides the theoretical 
results which are used as a foundation for naturalization of normativity. 
Naturalists must be able to bootstrap themselves out of the normative 
practices that permeate natural-scientific research. In other words: The 
naturalist would have to demonstrate that the results of the natural sciences 
are not part of the life-world in a substantial sense and bestowed with the 
power to reduce all normativity. Normativity is the target of naturalization, 
naturalization itself is based on results of scientific practice (i.e. physical 
science). But this turns out to be unproblematic, as it were, since a full 
account of the world based on future-ideal physics will simply include 
a naturalist account of the natural-scientific practice itself.
The bootstrapping assumption seems to provide the ontological naturalist 
with an elegant solution to the phenomenological argument. But the phe­
nomenologist might rebut here that naturalism exercises a 'studied suppres­
sion' of natural science's life-world origins (Scharff 2019, 129). However, the 
bootstrapping assumption is exactly what is targeted by the phenomenolo­
gical argument which implies that the results of the natural sciences, on 
which naturalization projects are based, presupposes the phenomenon (nor­
mativity) which the naturalist wants to reduce away. Thus, the naturalist and 
phenomenologist seem to have reached an impasse. The phenomenologist

will state that there is no escaping the normative swamp, yet the naturalist 
will assure us that she can pull herself out of it.
This impasse is an instance of what has been called deep disagreement. 
Deep disagreements are disagreements in a context that lacks sufficient 
common ground that would be necessary to decide the argument in either 
party's favour, or even to reach a compromise (Fogelin 1985, 7). I shall not 
provide an answer that would resolve this disagreement - that would be 
overly presumptuous. Instead, the purpose here is to pinpoint the nature and 
content of the deep disagreement between (reductive) naturalism and phe­
nomenology on this issue. A further suggestion at how this disagreement 
might be solved (further argument pending) is that whether the controversial 
principle is true depends on one's background assumptions on the nature of 
science as such.
In describing the nature of deep disagreement, I follow Ranalli's (2020) 
recent account. Ranalli characterizes deep disagreement as 'systematic dis­
agreements rooted in contrary worldviews' (Ranalli 2020,4976). 
Furthermore, he ascribes the following key properties (Ranalli 2021, 3):
Disagreement: deep disagreements need to be genuine, e.g. not merely 
about terminology.
Reason-taking: parties in deep disagreements take themselves to be giving 
reasons for their views, i.e. they are not merely dogmatic about their beliefs in 
question.
Systematicity: deep disagreements are systematic in the sense that they do 
not concern only a few statements, but a system of different inferentially 
connected beliefs.
Persistence: deep disagreements remain over time, seemingly untouched 
by length and quality of debate and exchange of arguments.
Two main theories that aim to account for these properties of deep 
disagreement are the Wittgensteinian hinge theory and the epistemic prin­
ciple theory. According to the former, deep disagreements are disagreements 
about hinge commitments (such as 'the earth is very, very old'), whereas the 
latter suggests that deep disagreements are about fundamental epistemic 
principles, i.e. about, say, belief-forming mechanisms (Ranalli 2018, 9 f.). 
Furthermore, there is a variety of topos-specific deep disagreements: deep 
metaphysical disagreement, deep ontological disagreement, deep moral dis­
agreement, or deep methodological disagreement.
We can tie these characteristics together with the example of Young Earth 
Creationism. Such disagreement is perhaps best described ontological, but 
certainly not as a moral disagreement. Regarding the four characteristics, 
disagreements about the age of the world are genuine, i.e. not merely about 
terminology, but about a tangible, material, important matter. Both Young 
Earth Creationists and, say, geologists, take themselves to provide good 
reasons (e.g. Bible scripture versus scientific evidence). Both parties' 
510
T. J. SPIEGEL

positions are systematic; for example, a Young Earth Creationist will not only 
state that the world is only 6000 years old, but is also committed to believing 
that geology is largely false and that the scientific community is proliferating 
a kind of conspiracy theory. And finally, the disagreement is very persistent, 
despite the long-lasting academic and political debate around these issues.12
The philosophical concept of deep disagreement can be applied to the 
controversial principle. It seems that the epistemic principle theory can 
account better for this case. This is for the reason that the controversial 
principle itself is a metaphilosophical statement about the feasibility of 
reduction. It seems that the soundness of the phenomenological argument 
hinges on whether the controversial principle is true. Phenomenologists 
seem to take the controversial principle for granted, whereas naturalists 
will typically find it intuitively plausible that the controversial principle is 
false. Firstly, this disagreement seems to be genuine, i.e. not easily resolvable 
through some terminological stipulation. It is probable that either side will 
simply dig their heels in. As I have argued elsewhere, some critiques of 
naturalism are left generally ignored (Spiegel 2020); and an analogous case 
might perhaps be made for some strands in the phenomenological tradition. 
Secondly both parties take themselves to be at least in principle to be in 
a position to justify their respective positions. Thirdly, the disagreement is 
systematic in the sense that the truth or falsity of the controversial principle 
would have far-reaching consequences for a whole host of questions in 
metaphysics and metaphilosophy. Lastly, the disagreement is persistent: 
reductive and phenomenological treatments of normativity have been 
around for at least 150 years, and there does not seem to have been sub­
stantial progress towards a 'decision' on the matter.
5. The Controversial Principle and the Nature of Science
Is there hope of solving this deep disagreement? Can either side decide the 
disagreement in their favour? It would be presumptuous to claim that there is 
an easily accessible argument available that has been simply overlooked in 
this long-standing deep disagreement. Given that further argument is unli­
kely to resolve the conflict, I shall demonstrate how the conflict might be 
transformed in a way that might render the disagreement more accessible.
As a short preface for this 'roundabout' answer, it is helpful to pin down 
what the phenomenological argument demands of the naturalist here: An 
ontological naturalist would have to demonstrate that the propositions or 
theories of a future-ideal physics are of a different status in a way that it 
12Should the reader find themselves tired or appalled by the example of Young Earth Creationism, 
finding it understandably outlandish, please note deep disagreements very often are such that anyone 
will find at least one of the sides of this divides outlandish. As such, I would consider it a virtue of 
Young Earth Creationism to be polarizing as an example of deep disagreement.

becomes clear that they are entirely divorced from their socio-normative 
origins. In other words, an ontological naturalist would have to demonstrate 
that scientific theories as propositions can be used as bootstraps to escape the 
normative swamp once and for all. Instead of providing a straight answer, 
I shall instead argue on behalf of the naturalist that an answer to this question 
is essentially dependent on which conception of science as a real-world 
institution is correct, i.e. what I call a perfectionist model versus 
a pragmatist model of science.
Ontological naturalism operates on a perfectionist model of science which 
it wears on its sleeves. As cited above (section 1), at least some prominent 
ontological naturalists, like Alex Rosenberg and Ronald Giere, are very vocal 
about their view that the successes of natural science justify our belief in there 
being a future state in which natural science as such is more or less con­
cluded. Such a belief to a future-ideal state indeed must be baked into 
ontological naturalism. This is because at least current physics is not able 
to account for a seamless reduction of normative properties to physical ones 
(being one of the reasons for some to reject reductive for supervenience 
physicalism) (Stoljar 2017, 17 f.). According to this model, the teleological 
end-point of science lies in a set of theories, interlocking to provide a full 
picture of the universe on which no further improvements can be made. This 
picture would a fortiori also yield the foundation for assigning normativity 
a place in the physical world. This final set of theories would also be 
impersonal, allowing for a complete spectator-perspective on the world, 
something like a new from nowhere (Nagel 1986). Once this putative per­
fected state is realized, there is no need for either science nor for scientists 
anymore. And this is how the perfectionist model would ultimately enable 
the kind of reduction of normativity the naturalist assumes to work: once we 
have reached this putative perfected state and attained a hopefully slender, 
self-standing set of physical theories in the form of propositions, it will be 
possible to show how normativity xis 'nothing over-and-above' physical 
properties. The perfectionist model thus enables or licenses the reductive 
proclivities of naturalism.
In contrast, the phenomenological argument demands a broadly pragma­
tist conception of science championed by thinkers in the pragmatist tradition 
(e.g. Dewey, Kitcher 2015) and also some phenomenologists (most notably 
Heidegger, at least his pragmatist readings).According to the pragmatist 
conception, science is a project that accompanies human practice as 
human life continues. According to the pragmatist model, science is not 
able to yield a pure observer-perspective on the world without involvement; 
the participant perspective is essential. The pragmatist model views science 
more like a democratic process which is open-ended and never finished. As 
a potentially open-ended project of humankind, science cannot even 
512
T. J. SPIEGEL

reproduce itself without personified scientists. Science enables learning pro­
cesses, not dogmatic beliefs, according to such a view.
And this is how the pragmatist conception of science precludes the 
reduction of normativity. First, on the pragmatist conception science as an 
institution is always permeated by normative relations. The quasi- 
democratic structures of science as an institution require a robust sense of 
normativity. And secondly, if science is essentially a human practice which is 
essentially designed to accompany human life as such, then science is never 
'finished' as a matter of principle. Therefore, on this model, scientific the­
ories can never be 'emancipated' from their normative foundations in science 
as an institution as the perfectionist model aims to. Thus, the pragmatist 
model precludes any kind of metaphysical reduction of normativity, at least 
on the basis of scientific theories in naturalization projects.
If it is correct that two different conceptions of science tacitly underlie the 
naturalist and phenomenological treatment of normativity, then how does 
that help resolve the stand-off? In the first instance, this shifts the question 
from (meta-)metaphysical questions regarding reduction and fundamental­
ity onto a different field, namely the 'nature' of science. The question 
regarding the nature of science is, perhaps, no less intricate than the former. 
After all, the question which conception of science is more accurate will have 
a multitude of perhaps unforeseeable implications across a wide range of 
areas. So some may say that manoeuvre leads from one impasse to the next. 
Contrary to such pessimism, the shift to a question about the nature of 
science may help resolve the stalemate as a small dialectical step. This is 
because the question about the 'nature' of science is, unlike questions about 
reduction, not exclusively a metaphysical question, but rather a question 
which is investigated by several scientific disciplines (next to philosophy of 
science itself, of course). More specifically, the transdisciplinary field of 
science studies, as a kind of science of science, which encompasses 
approaches from different disciplines, chief among them social science.
This shift is then helpful in two ways. First of all, if the question about 
whether normativity is genuine leads us to consider the 'nature' of science, 
then we do not have to rely solely on metaphysical reasoning, but can look at 
evidence provided by scientific investigation into science. Methodological 
agreements might be more easily resolvable than metaphysical disagree­
ments. Second, and relatedly, this is an approach which ought to be palatable 
and agreeable particularly to defenders of ontological naturalism. While the 
kind of naturalism at question here is ontological, and although ontological 
naturalism does not imply methodological naturalism, ontological natural­
ists have good reason to endorse some form methodological naturalism. This 
is mirrored in philosophical practice since, at least anecdotally, ontological 
naturalists tend to subscribe to some form of methodological naturalism (I

naturalism in the tradition of Quine states that philosophy ought to be 
continuous with science (Quine 1960, 209). While this can be interpreted 
in different ways - De Caro (De Caro 2009, 369 f.) identifies a dozen possible 
interpretations - it usually amounts to the idea that science ought to be the 
ultimate arbiter of how philosophy ought to be done. Applied to the current 
context, this means that a commitment to methodological naturalism (which 
many ontological naturalists do hold) renders it attractive to reconceive the 
question about the reduction of normativity to become a question about the 
scientific investigation about the nature of science. This is, of course, not 
a conclusive answer, but would rather call for further research into what 
evidence the science of science can be utilized to be applicable for the 
question what the 'nature' of science amounts to.
6. A Slightly Optimistic Conclusion
This paper aimed at providing a systematic reconstruction of the phenom­
enological intuition that the life-world is in some sense more fundamental 
than scientific inquiry. This is ultimately an argument against the attempts of 
ontological naturalism to reduce normative properties. In reconstructing the 
argument, it turns out that the crucial point of contention is whether the fact 
that normative properties of the life-world enabling science implies that 
those normative properties cannot be shown to be nothing over-and-above 
physical stuff. Instead of providing an argument for either side to settle this 
question, I have suggested that pushing the dialectic here further is contin­
gent upon what conception of science one endorses: a pragmatist conception 
or a perfectionist conception. The broadly pragmatist conception views 
science as a potentially never-ending quasi-democratic process which 
accompanies human practice as it goes forward. In contrast, the perfectionist 
conception views the project of science as engaged in a progress towards an 
ultimate set of theories upon which no further improvement can be made, 
essentially completing science. Out of those two, only the perfectionist view 
implies that the ontological naturalist can pull herself up by her hair out of 
the normative swamp of the life-world; for if we can hope for a future-ideal 
physics, then that set of theories will be able to demonstrate how 
a completely satisfactory reduction of normative properties to physical 
properties is possible. On the other hand, the pragmatist conception of 
science suggests that normative properties are always already operative and 
essential to the scientific process in a way that precludes them being reduced.
It would be presumptuous to have claimed that one of the most intractable 
difference between two major traditions of thought - naturalism and phe­
nomenology - can this easily be settled. I have therefore not arrogated the 
right to provide a conclusive answer. What I hope to have demonstrated, 
however, is that one of the central discrepancies between these two

competitors - whether normativity is reducible - turns on the question what 
conception of science is correct. It might therefore be preferable to inquire 
further into this direction rather than either look for more refined physicalist 
accounts on the one hand or to simply restate the priority of the life-world 
without further argument on the other hand. In any case, the optimistic hope 
is that shifting the question of the reducibility of normativity to the question 
of the right conception of science, we can contribute to a further dialogue 
between the vastly disjointed tradition of phenomenology and naturalism.
