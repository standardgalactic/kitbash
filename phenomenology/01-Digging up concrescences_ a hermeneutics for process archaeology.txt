ABSTRACT
In this paper I build on the process philosophy of Whitehead and on enactive 
approachs to hermeneutics, to suggest that if we want to conceive of archae­
ological practice in terms of a process archaeology, then rather than character­
izing it as 'digging up the past', it is better to think of it as digging up 
concrescences. From the perspective of enactive hermeneutics, no artifact 
(from past or present) is a completely determinate matter of fact; its meaning 
is enacted in an ecology of practices, and should be understood as part of 
a dynamical network (of uses and beliefs) that changes when viewed from 
different perspectives. To the extent that an artifact retains an affordance- 
related meaning, whether original or new, it remains a concrescence and is 
never reducible to a determinate matter of fact.

According to a popular conception (Holtorf 2016), and perhaps on an outdated professional concep­
tion, archeologists dig up the past. They unearth artifacts, which, as C. Leonard Woolley put it, at first 
'dazzle' us by their 'novelty', but then 'withdraw, and linking up with other things in the field of 
ordered vision, become features in the historical background against which, consciously or uncon­
sciously, we play our part' (1930, 11-12). In this paper I want to explore the idea of the 'field of ordered 
vision', and the part we play against the historical background, and precisely what that means for 
archeological interpretation if we are thinking of archaeology in process terms (Gosden and Malafouris 
2015). Woolley goes on to say that the significance of what we dig up is not the age of the object 
(fossils and stars are much older), but their connection to our own life practices. If history in some way 
shapes our perception and our actions, the unearthed artifacts participate in this shaping. In this 
regard, then, we can ask what precisely are we digging up when we dig up the past.
To answer this question I will consider what some may think strange philosophical bedfellows: an 
enactive analysis of the field of ordered perception, which informs an enactive hermeneutics, and 
a particular conception of process philosophy developed by Alfred North Whitehead. Rather than 
characterizing archeology as 'digging up the past', I'll argue it is better to think of it as digging up what 
Whitehead calls 'concrescences', which is consistent with more recent understandings of what arche­
ologists actually do (e.g. Olsen et al. 2012; Malafouris 2013; Witmore 2014) On the former view, digging 
up a particular artifact from the past would be equivalent to digging up an ex-concrescence, or 
a 'concretum' (Kline 1969). A concretum, however, is defined by Whitehead, in Process and Reality, as 'a 
completely determinate matter of fact' (Whitehead 1957, 322), a finished product of a concrescent 
process. In contrast, following principles of enactive hermeneutics, archeological practice shows us

that no artifact (from past or present) is a completely determinate matter of fact; rather, it should be 
understood as part of a dynamical network (or, to borrow a phrase from Witmore (2014, 204 n), who 
borrows it from Isabelle Stengers (2005), an 'ecology of practices') that changes when viewed from 
different perspectives. Although Whitehead thought that concreta were more 'concrete' than con­
crescences (1957, 433), in fact, one can argue that concreta are abstractions (Kline 1969). Accordingly, 
an artifact, understood as a concretum, is reduced to its purely physical existence and robbed of its 
affordance-related meaning. To the extent that, in a perceptual field, which is more than just a field of 
ordered vision, an artifact retains an affordance-related meaning, whether original or new, it remains 
a concrescence and never reducible to a determinate concretum. I'll make this argument through an 
examination of how archeologists interpret artifacts of past cultures.
The paper is organized as follows. In the first section I'll provide a short primer on Whitehead's 
notion of concrescence. In the second section I'll relate this to an enactive view of perception and 
interpretation. I'll then discuss the archeological treatment of artifacts, and finally draw some 
conclusions.
Concresence
Whitehead distinguished between 'concrescence', as the becoming or the process constituting an 
actual entity, and 'transition', the dynamical connection between a concrescence and an ex- 
concrescence (1957, 320-322). Much of what I have to say about concrescence builds on the 
interpretation of George Kline's (1969) reading of Whitehead. Kline offers the term 'concretum' in 
place of ex-concresence. A concretum is a past concrescence that is no longer a concrescence, but 
rather, a 'completely determinate matter of fact' (Whitehead 1957, 322, 433).
The difference between concrescences and concreta is roughly that between specific (present) processes, 
and specific (past) products, of actualization. Concreta are no-longer-actual in the double sense suggested 
by the French actuel: they are 'no-longer-present' as well as 'no-longer-active'. (Kline 1969, 351).
The description here remains rather abstract, so to provide some bearings with respect to arche­
ology, I suggest that we start by thinking of the concretum as a newly discovered artifact, and the 
process of analysis or interpretation, which includes perceiving and acting and interacting with the 
artifact, and with others, to be the complex concrescent process that enacts meaning. We'll see that 
the transition between concretum and concresence is a complex process.
Kline argues, following Donald Sherburne (1961), that transition is in fact a form of concrescence; 
and that they are both 'species of one process'. Perhaps more importantly, they are both relational 
processes. Transition just is the dynamical relation of concrescence to concretum which makes 
concrescence what it is. In Whitehead's terms, concrescence is occasioned by its physical prehension 
of a concretum. The term 'prehension' is a technical term in Whitehead's process ontology. Kline 
suggests that prehension is equivalent to a process of 'actualizing' or 'enacting', in which concres­
cences have agency: 'agency belongs exclusively to actual occasions [i.e. to concrescences]' 
(Whitehead 1957, 46; Kline 1969, 356). This claim, however, can be significantly qualified. Given 
that the concretum is passive and product-like, and that agency is said to belong to concrescence, 
one might expect that the concretum has no agency. Kline raises this question explicitly: do 
concreta remain passive? '[A]re concreta—as no-longer-concrescent entities - in any sense agents? 
Whitehead's own answers to these questions range over a broad spectrum . . . ' (1969, 357). The 
range runs from
16
S. GALLAGHER

(1) the idea that the concretum is a 'dead datum' from the past (Whitehead 1957, 249), providing 
potentiality for the prehension process (1957, 101), to
(2) the claim that concreta 'provoke some special activity' in present concresences (Whitehead 
1942, 226), to
(3) the idea that 'the creativity of the world is the throbbing emotion of the past hurling itself into 
a new transcendent fact' (1942, 227). In this regard he suggests that the concretum 'claims its 
self-identical existence as a living issue in the present' (1942, 233-234).
On the basis of this third set of descriptions, Kline suggests:
They strongly and incautiously suggest that the past is active, that concreta are agents. Thus Whitehead 
characterizes experience as 'heavy with the contact of things gone by, which lay their grip on our 
immediate [i.e., present, concrescent] selves . . . and refers to 'the real operation of the antecedent 
particulars [i.e., concreta] imposing themselves on the novel particular [i.e., the concrescence] in [a] 
process of creation'. (Kline 1969, 358)1
The ambiguity in Whitehead is persistent. One possible resolution to this ambiguity is to understand 
him to be describing different perspectives. Specifically, if we view a concretum in isolation from its 
world, it appears abstract and passive; but if we view it, or engage with it, in the context of its world, 
or in the concrescence-concretum relation, it contributes to the agency required for enacting its 
meaning: ' . . . viewed in abstraction objects are passive, but viewed in conjunction they carry the 
creativity which drives the world' (1942, 230ff).
Gosden and Malafouris (2015), citing Whitehead's process philosophy, capture an example of this 
creativity or 'becomingness', that is, an example of concrescence, in pottery-making, and specifically 
the potter's relation to the vase as the clay affords a forming by the potter's hands on the wheel. The 
potting process is a prehension that integrates micro- and macro-processes in a 'temporal binding, 
and the material consciousness that comes with it, is immanent not just in the potter's brain/body 
but in the ongoing feedback loops between biological and non-biological materials, energies and 
surroundings. Prehension, in other words, is a metaphysical partnership of heterogeneous elements 
with emerging experiential content, i.e. a feeling of and for clay . . . ' (2015, 706).
The same kind of processual integration or prehension takes place in the broader archaeological 
process. Again, to make all of this a bit less abstract, let's consider the example of an archaeological 
dig. One might begin with a set of expectations of what one might find, especially if one has some 
knowledge about the area and the history of where one is starting to dig; at the same time, one 
readily admits to not knowing what one will find. To take a specific example, our knowledge of the 
Etruscans was significant but incomplete in the 1960s. Archaeologists had studied gravesites and 
sanctuaries near cities that had been Etruscan, and Etruscan culture was thought to be dependant 
on that of pre-Roman and Classical Greece. When Kyle Phillips started his dig at the Etruscan site of 
Poggio Civitate in Murlo, near Siena in 1966, he expected to find the remains of ordinary houses and 
shops to better understand the everyday life of that culture (Phillips 1993). The concreta he found 
resisted his interpretations. He was digging in a mound (agger) under which he found a complex of 
buildings that had been 'deliberately dismantled [and] ritually buried' around 530 BCE (1993, xiv). 
Terracotta decorations suggested not houses and shops, but a temple, but they were different from 
any other known Etruscan temples, and the building plan was different from any other known 
temple in Greece or Italy. The concreta, here the building parts, the terracotta and a huge number of 
other items, did not remain a passive collection of objects; they entered into and started to unravel 
and reshape the concrescent processes that included the actual digging and the ongoing

interpretation. Almost like a group of philosophers, the artifacts challenged the archaeologists' 
assumptions, which were unable to make sense of structures that were deliberately dismantled and 
buried, that were not Greek like, and that were not temple like. Still, the thought persisted that it was 
some kind of sanctuary. On the fifth year of the dig, Phillips found the remains of an earlier building 
dating to c. 675 BCE, which had been destroyed by fire in 610, and then replaced with the newer 
building. All the while, Phillips had been communicating his findings to the broader archaeological 
community, and various hypotheses were proposed, the most honest of which was: 'This complex 
should not have existed in the Archaic period. But it did. What can we do? How can we interpret it' 
(Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli, cited in Phillips 1993, xvi).
We'll return to Poggio Civitate later. What we can see, even from this brief account, however, is 
that the concreta are neither abstract nor without agency. Rather, as Witmore (2014), citing 
Whitehead, points out, 'things are participants in their own emergence', and they emerge in an 
'ecology of practices', which, Witmore explains, 'refers to archaeology as a specific community and 
a distinctive habitat including a mesh of interconnected spaces, objects and practices' (204 n). This 
emergence in an ecology of practices just is the concrescent process that shapes and is shaped by 
whatever concreta emerge and immediately become concrescent.
Coming back to the Whiteheadean ontology, Kline draws a clear but overly strict contrast 
between concrescence and concretum (Table 1). For Kline, to say that concrescence is 'concrete' 
means that it is self-significant - it has significance (meaning and relevance) in- and for-itself. To say 
that the concretum is 'abstract' means that it has meaning only for others, not for itself. Specifically, 
it has meaning only for a concrescence, or its meaning is enacted only in a process of concrescent 
prehension. If one tries to define it outside of the prehension process, it can be regarded as 
abstract.2 Isn't there a sense in which the concretum is what it is, independently of any occurrent 
process? Kline is attracted to this idea: 'the relation of concrescence to concretum is external with 
respect to the concretum and internal with respect to the concrescence. A given concrescence is 
altered by the fact of its relation to (physical prehension of) a given concretum, but the concretum is 
not altered by its being related to [a concrescence]' (1969, 357). Kline interprets Whitehead as 
a realist in this regard. Yet, with respect to sense-making, the concretum is entirely dependent on 
concrescence - both for its original sense (since it originates as a concrescence) and for any 
subsequent sense, since it only has meaning for later concrescences. This suggests, again, that we 
should think of these concepts only in relation - as concretum-concrescence - and only in a more 
complex ecology.
For Whitehead, concrescence is active, a self-producing actualization and a temporally dynamic 
process. It is non-objectifiable in the sense that it does not objectify itself or other concrescences. 
The concretum, however, does get objectified in the prehending process - it is an object for 
a concrescence. 'It belongs to the nature of a 'being' [i.e. a concretum] that it is a potential [object] 
for every 'becoming' [concrescence]" (Whitehead 1957, 33; see 71, 101). To be an object for 
a concrescence, however, simply means to be part of the prehending process of the concrescence.

In all of this, the idea is that the unit of explanation is the concrescence-concretum relation which, 
like the potter's vase, and the concreta at Poggio Civitate, takes shape in nothing other than the 
concresence process, in which meaning and significance are enacted.
Enaction
Although Kline prefers to think of concrescence as a 'microscopic' process, active on a level closer to 
atomic structure, some of his examples involve human perception and memory. My perception of 
a clock on the wall is considered a 'concrescent experience'. Likewise, my 'memory-experience' is of 
that perceptual experience. We can think of concrescence, then, in these more complex macro- 
processes, where biologically-based and world-involving sense-making is involved. In this respect, 
enactive approaches to perception are relevant, and can be understood as consistent with dis­
tributed conceptions of agency found in the 'incautious' agentive reading of Whitehead's notion of 
concretum, as well as in material engagement theory (Malafouris 2013).
Embodied-enactive approaches, rooted in phenomenological and ecological conceptions of psy­
chology, oppose the more standard cognitivist views that understand cognition to be a matter of 
internal ('in the head') representational processes. On that standard view, objects and environments 
are epistemically innert or passive. In contrast, on the enactive view we perceive the world in terms of 
what Husserl (1989) called the 'I can', or what Merleau-Ponty (2012) called operative, embodied 
intentionality. These concepts are cashed out by Gibson (1977) in terms of 'affordances'. In other 
words, we perceive an object in a pragmatic framework, in terms of what we can do with it, or what it 
affords. Perception in this regard is sensory-motor and action-oriented. Importantly, the notion of 
affordance is a relational one. The perception of a chair as affording sitting is not only due to the chair, 
based on its particular size and shape, but also depends on the perceiver's body - its size, shape, 
bendable joints, etc. Affective factors and interest may also play a role in how someone perceives the 
world. The perception of a cliff as climbable depends not only on the structure of the cliff, but also on 
the perceiver's skill, mood, and energy level. The notion of affordance, and its relationality, can be 
extended to social, cultural and normative factors as well. I may perceive others in terms of how I can 
interact with them, and this may be well defined by various cultural practices and normative 
constraints. There are some things I can't do, not because of physical limitations, but because of 
customs and prohibitions. The food on your plate affords eating, but I can't, or I shouldn't help myself 
to it. Affordance theory has started to acknowledge the complexity of behaviors that need to be 
explained (see, e.g. Ramstead, Veissière, and Kirmayer 2016; Kiverstein, van Dijk, and Rietveld 2021)
For enactivists, perception, action, and memory (the latter understood as the re-enaction of 
perceptual processes), involve basic embodied-cognitive processes that are not reducible to 
mental events as they are traditionally understood, or neural processes in the head. In this regard, 
like pragmatists such as John Dewey, they take cognition to involve interaction with the environ­
ment, including the social environment. Even reflective decision making and problem solving are 
considered embodied processes, and they often involve processes that are explicitly social. 
A decision, for example, is reached via intersubjective interaction (in conversation or other 
communicative processes), and a problem can be solved by engaging in joint action. Enactive 
approaches are usually included in what has come to be called 4E (embodied, embedded or 
ecological, extended and enactive) cognition (Gallagher 2017; Newen, De Bruin, and Gallagher 
2018; Rowlands 2010; Wynn, Overmann, and Malafouris 2021). Although these different 'E's are 
not always entirely in agreement, some interpretations attempt to integrate these perspectives 
(Gallagher 2017; Malafouris 2013, 2021a, 2021b). Thus, enactivists sometimes incorporate insights

19

garnered from the extended mind approach. For example, instruments, technologies and artifacts, 
as well as other people, and institutions, extend our cognitive processes and our affordance 
possibilities beyond what any one individual cognizer might be able to do by herself (Clark 2008; 
Gallagher 2013).
Enactivists think of these processes in terms of dynamical systems theory, where the system is 
variously characterized in relational terms as 'brain-body-environment', or (in terms drawn from 
Dewey 1922) 'organism-environment', or as a coupling of perceiver and world. The coupling 
relations that define the system are dynamical, involving a circular or reciprocal causality (Kelso 
1995), such that it is not possible to explain the role of one term (e.g. the perceiving body), without 
considering the other term (the perceived world). To focus on one side of any of these relations will 
end with an abstraction. In this respect, basic embodied-cognitive processes are well modeled in 
process terms and the enactive conception is consistent with the idea of the concrescence- 
concretum relation as we explicated it above. Specifically, enactive perception just is a macro- 
scale concrescent process in which concreta are enacted, not by a discrete, individuated perceiving 
mind that represents an innert external world, but within the dynamical ecology formed in coupling 
relations (what Hodder 2012 calls 'entanglements') that characterize organism-environment (or 
brain-body-environment - where environment is physical, but also social and cultural).
I have argued elsewhere (Gallagher 2016; Gallagher, Muñoz, and Gastelum 2017) that this 
conception of enactive perception forms the basis for an enactive hermeneutics - a practice in 
which interpretation is a relational process framed by pragmatic, affordance-based dynamics. One's 
interpretation of an object is not a purely cognitive recognition or identification of what the object 
means independently of the interpretation process. It rather involves the embodied and affective 
responses of the interpreter to the object's significance. This is what Gadamer calls 'the hermeneutic 
situation', which includes not only the horizonal limits of interpretation, but also the interpreter 
understood as an agent, and the affordances (physical, pragmatic, social and cultural) that are 
relative to that agent.
The very idea of a situation means that we are not standing outside of it; hence we are unable to have 
any [purely] objective knowledge concerning it. We always find ourselves within a situation, and 
throwing light on it is a task that is never entirely finished. This is also true of the hermeneutic situation 
(Gadamer 2004, 301)3
In the Whiteheadian terms developed in the previous section, the concrescence-concretum relation, 
understood as macro-processes of human perception, action, and sense-making, has the same 
structure as a hermeneutical situation. Concrescence and concretum are co-relational and defined 
relative to each other; and this co-relationality shapes our interpretations of what things mean and 
what value they may have. On the macro-scale, perception and sense making are embodied, 
situated, and intersubjective. As William Clancey (1997) suggests, human thought and action are 
situated 'because what people perceive, how they conceive of their activity, and what they 
physically do develop together'.
If perception, action, memory, problem solving, or cognition more generally, are understood on 
some coherent model of dynamical, enactive processes that can be cashed out in terms of 
concrescence-concretum process theory, what implications does this hold for archaeological 
practice?

S. GALLAGHER

The process of archaeological practice
How do archaeologists do what they do? Of course, this is a complicated question because 
archaeologists do many different kinds of things. I want to focus on their analysis of artifacts. 
Obviously, digging through soil and rock is an embodied action, but once something is dug up and 
cleaned off, the hermeneutical digging which begins is also an embodied action. Accordingly, I want 
to argue, in the process of archaeological practice interpretations emerge on principles of enactive 
hermeneutics.
Here I want to reference an example that I have used elsewhere (Gallagher 2020). The example, in 
some respects, represents a popular conception of archaeology and itself is the result of digging up 
the past, and specifically digging up a piece of history in the form of a very old television show called 
'What in the world'. This was a show on archaeology that aired weekly on CBS in the United States in 
the 1950s (still available on YouTube). Each week a group of three academic experts (consistently male 
professors middle-aged to older), moderated by the archaeologist Froelich Rainey, considered some 
object that was unearthed at an archaeological dig somewhere on earth, and which was now housed 
in the University of Pennsylvania Museum, or traveling through the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The 
experts were given the task of identifying the object, saying where it was from, what time period it 
belonged to, and what it was used for. They almost always figured it out, although sometimes they 
failed. They accomplished their analysis in a conversational mode, with the thing (whatever it 
happened to be) clearly and explicitly the focal point. Every sentence they spoke was in some way 
linked to the meaning of this material object. A fuller characterization, however, is that the meaning of 
the object was accomplished in their engagement with it and their engagement with each other.
In this process, we can again start by taking the object to be investigated as the concretum, and 
the process of analysis or interpretation, which includes perceiving and acting and interacting with 
others, to be the complex concrescent process that enacts meaning. On the standard cognitivist or 
internalist version, the way to think about how the interpretation proceeds is to think that each 
expert has a set of representations or files in his head that he tries to match to the object. If they 
identify the object as coming from New Guinea, for example, then there would be a list of options 
concerning possible materials, possible time-periods, possible uses, given what they know of that 
culture. On this view there is a kind of calculation that allows for a process of elimination until they 
whittle the list down to a few possibilities and make their best educated guess. The object, in this 
case, is a passive datum that at best offers evidence, and the scientific procedure is to test that 
evidence against prior knowledge.
This is not the way it happens, however. On the television show, the analysis typically starts 
when the three experts leave their seats and gather around the object. The experts take turns in 
picking it up to take a closer look; they turn it over and turn it around; they view it from every angle 
possible; they feel its texture, its weight, in some cases they knock on it to hear what it sounds like. 
They then pass it to the next person. As they do this, they are making suggestions about what the 
object is, about where and when it may have originated, and about what it was used for. 
Disagreement among the experts is worked out in conversation, but their interaction goes beyond 
an exchange of words. In attempting to identify the object's use, they use it, or at least gesture its 
use, picking it up and mimicking how someone might have done something with it. If it is a face 
mask, for example, one of them may hold it up to his face. One of them may point to a particular 
feature in order to explain his hypothesis about the historical period. In some cases, the object 
resists their suggestions and they have to rethink. Some newly discovered part or feature of the 
object tells them that this can't be from that place or that time period, or that it could not really be

21

used that way. The experts are asking each other some of these questions, and they are asking, for 
example, 'What does this object represent'? 'What is its significance'? 'What meaning might it have 
for a particular culture'?
Clearly, they do have an expert knowledge of their field that may be expressed abstractly in a list 
of possibilities; but this list is not consulted so much as deployed. Moreover, the deployment 
necessarily involves the object which in some way plays an active role - resisting or presenting 
possibilities. The object affords some limited set of uses which they try out, physically coupling with 
the object in their actions of grasping, picking it up, and manipulating it. In some cases one 
professor's particular gesture may prefigure the correct answer. He may make a hand gesture that 
correlates to the shape of the object; the hand, in this shape, may move in a way that constitutes 
a cue or a clue that one of the other experts picks up.
If this process of interpretation is itself a complex concrescent process, the artifact, as a concretum, 
is actively shaping that process. From one perspective, of course, the object might appear inert and 
passive. Once the engagement starts, however, as the interlocutors attempt to (1) place it, as the 
concretum, in the context of its world, and simultaneously (2) incorporate it into the ongoing 
concrescence-concretum relation that constitutes the analysis or the ecology of archaeological 
practice, the object contributes to the agency required for enacting its meaning. Just here it is clear 
that there are two horizons involved: on the one hand there is the past world (a set of concreta that 
were concrescences) to which the object at some point belonged, and the aim of the analysis is to fit 
the object into that world; on the other hand, there is the process of the present moment, in the 
museum, and on the television stage (or alternatively, in some museum or academic setting), where 
the experts are engaged with the establishment of a present meaning. In hermeneutical terms, the 
interpretive task is to attain a 'fusion of horizons' (Gadamer 2004). The concrescence just is the 
meshing of these horizons, where neither concretum nor concrescence could exist without the 
other. In these circumstances, meaning is not pre-given or predefined, but is structured within the 
dynamical processes of the actions that are taken; it shows up as a set of affordances as the 
archaeologists pick up the objects and manipulate them. For an enactivist hermeneutics, in which 
body and environment, concrescence and concretum exist only in relation to each other, this co- 
relationality shapes our interpretations of what things mean and what value they may have.
Conclusion
Building on the process philosophy of Whitehead and the enactive approach to hermeneutics, 
I suggest that if we want to conceive of archaeological practice in terms of a process archaeology, 
rather than characterizing it as 'digging up the past', or as unearthing concreta, it is better to think of 
it as digging up concrescences. To return to Poggio Civitate, the process stretched over several years 
and involved not only extensive digging and the unearthing of artifacts and buildings, but also 
extensive communications between Phillips and knowledgable local citizens and museums who 
advised where to dig, among the students who did the digging, among funding sources and 
universities, and among a larger community of archaeologists. The concreta-concrescent ecology 
of archaeological practice eventually led to an understanding of the building complex as a set of 
meeting halls for a federation that composed a Northern Etruscan league from about 675-530 BCE. 
But that's not the end of it. Ongoing research references this interpretation, but the concreta of 
architectural terracottas, for example, and many other findings, continue to throw up questions 
about their social, political, and religious meanings (e.g. De Grummond 1997; Potts 2020; Tuck 2021). 
They continue to shape our understandings.

From the perspective of enactive hermeneutics, no artifact (from past or present) is a completely 
determinate matter of fact or a mere concretum; its meaning is enacted in the process of inter­
pretation. It should be understood as part of a dynamical ecology (of uses or affordances) that 
changes when viewed from different perspectives. To the extent that an artifact retains an affor­
dance-related meaning, whether original or new, it remains a concrescence and is never reducible to 
something fully determinate. To put it in Woolley's terms, an artifact, as concretum, can 'dazzle' only 
insofar as it is engaged in the concrescent process; it can get linked up with other things only in 
a field of action-oriented perception; and we can play our part, against this historical background, 
only through this engagement. To the extent that history shapes our perception and our actions, 
unearthed artifacts also participate in this shaping.
Notes
1. Kline, although carefully detailing the ambiguity in Whitehead, labels this third view as 'incautious' and he 
ultimately rejects it because it does not align with Kline's own view about the nature of time, where the 
past exists but is entirely fixed and inactive, although it continues to have causal efficacy (see Kline 1986).
2. In this regard I do not follow Kline in his detailed analysis; he was concerned to explain a number of other 
aspects of Whitehead's philosophy, including 'eternal objects' which are also abstract. In contrast, Kline 
calls the concretum 'quasi-abstract'. In either case it means 'without meaning for itself'. Throughout his 
analysis Kline acknowledges ambiguities and inconsistencies in Whitehead.
3. Gadamer's definition of the hermeneutical situation aligns perfectly with Dewey's concept of situation in 
which the agent is a necessary part. 'The statement that individuals live in a world means, in the concrete, 
that they live in a series of situations . . . . The conceptions of situation and of interaction are inseparable 
from each other' (1938, 43; see Gallagher 2017, 54ff).
