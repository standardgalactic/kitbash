Heidegger's Phenomenology as
Transcendental Philosophy
Paul Gorner
Abstract
In this paper I seek to shed some light on Heidegger's conception of 
phenomenology, and on the relationship between Heidegger's conception
and that of Husserl. In particular, I am concerned to elucidate the sense in
which Heidegger's phenomenology can be seen as a species of transcen-
dental philosophy. In the concluding section of the paper I briey consider
the signicance of Heidegger's conception of phenomenology for his later
philosophy, as represented by 'The Question Concerning Technology'. 
Keywords: Heidegger, Husserl, phenomenology, ontology, 
transcendental, being
1 Phenomenology of Dasein
In his Marburg lectures of the summer semester 1927 Heidegger quotes
Fichte: 'Gentlemen, think the wall, and then think the one who thinks the
wall' ('Meine Herren, denken Sie die Wand, und dann denken Sie den,
der die Wand denkt').1 Thinking the wall would be an example of what
Husserl calls an intentional experience (intentionales Erlebnis) or mental
act in which a subject is directed toward an object. Thinking the one who
thinks the wall is an instance of self-consciousness. Consciousness and 
self-consciousness constitute the basis of Husserl's phenomenology. For
Heidegger 'thinking the wall' is an abstraction. In our natural comport-
ment (Verhalten) toward things we never think a single thing. We always
think it from out of a contexture (Zusammenhang) of things to which it
belongs: wall, room, surroundings.2 And thinking itself is grounded in
something more basic. What, Heidegger asks, is always already given prior
to explicitly thinking things? How do the things with which we 'dwell'
(uns aufhalten) show themselves to us primarily and for the most part?
What is primarily given is a contexture of things. To the 'nearest' things
which surround us he gives the name Zeug, equipment - things with which
we have to do. What is primarily given to us is an equipmental whole,

e.g. stairs, corridor, windows, chair, benches, blackboard. But it is not 
given as an object of consciousness. When we come through the door we
do not apprehend the benches as such, any more than we do the door-
knob.3 But they are there for us in passing them, avoiding bumping into
them, and so on. The items thus encountered are essentially something
for something. 
What Heidegger is doing here is phenomenology as he understands it.
This is not simply describing what is given as it is given, although this is
pretty much what he understands by phenomenology in what he calls the
formal sense. The formal conception of phenomenology is summed up 
in the celebrated maxim: 'To the things themselves!' ('Zu den Sachen
selbst!'). As the name suggests, phenomenology is the study of phenomena.
But it all depends on what is understood by 'phenomenon'. By 'phenom-
enon' Heidegger understands 'that which shows itself', or, more precisely,
'that which shows itself in itself' (das Sich-an-ihm-selbst-zeigende).4 This
is contrasted with its privative modication, semblance (Schein), and the
various senses of 'appearance' (Erscheinung) - in particular that meaning
according to which what appears does not show itself but announces itself
through something which does show itself (e.g. symptoms of illness).
Phenomenology in the formal sense is the letting be seen (Sehenlassen)
of that which shows itself. 
But what is it that phenomenology as a method of philosophy lets be
seen? It is something which primarily and for the most part does not show
itself, but is hidden or concealed. But though concealed, it belongs essen-
tially to what does show itself, in such a way that it is the ground of what
shows itself. This is not this or that being or entity but the being of beings
or entities, the being of what is (das Sein des Seienden). For phenome-
nology as philosophy phenomenon, that which shows itself but has rst
to be made to show itself, is the being of entities, its modications and
derivatives.5 So phenomenology in the philosophical sense is the exhibiting
(Aufweisung), the letting be seen (Sehenlassen), of being (Sein). Being is
that which determines entities as entities, that by reference to which or
on the basis of which (woraufhin) entities are always already understood.6
Being is that which lets what is be, which determines it as being (seiend).
And the understanding of being is what lets what is show itself as some-
thing that is. Understanding of being makes all comportment to entities
- those which I am not and that which I myself am - possible.
With this characterization of phenomenology as a method of philos-
ophy in mind, let us now return to the example of Heidegger doing
phenomenology given at the beginning. Although he is talking about enti-
ties - the wall, chairs, etc. - what is thematic, what is focused on, is not
these entities as such but their way of being. The way of being of the enti-
ties he calls equipment (Zeug) is Zuhandensein, being-ready-to-hand,
being- available. Phenomenological 'seeing' is directed toward entities, but

in such a way that what is being thematized is not the entity as such but
its being. In Heidegger's phenomenology phenomenological seeing is led
back from the apprehension of an entity to the understanding of the being
of this entity.7 Phenomenology is the letting be seen of the structure of
an entity's being. This being (Sein) is not something laid up in some 
realm to which the phenomenologist has some mysterious kind of access.
Rather phenomenology is the letting be seen of what is understood in the
understanding of being which always already belongs to the being of that
entity which we ourselves are. To emphasize the fact that what distin-
guishes human beings from all other beings is the understanding of 
being Heidegger uses the ontological term of art 'Dasein' to refer to
human beings. In the case of that mode of being called Zuhandensein one
gets clear about it by making explicit the understanding of being which
is already implicit in our concernful having-to-do-with things (Besorgen).
We do not have to put ourselves into this mode of comportment; we 
are always already in it. Readiness-to-hand (or availableness) is what
determines something ready-to-hand as ready-to-hand. It is that on the
basis of which something ready-to-hand is always already understood.
Understanding of being, in this case being as Zuhandensein, is a condi-
tion of the possibility of entities showing themselves, or of our comport-
ment to entities.
Phenomenology, as understood by Heidegger, is phenomenology of
Dasein. This may seem to contradict the claim that the phenomenon of
Heidegger's phenomenology is being. The absolute prerequisite of doing
philosophy, in Heidegger's view, is recognition of what he calls the onto-
logical difference. Being is not a being. But Dasein is a being. Dasein is
a being but not just a being, occurring among other beings. The being
(Sein) of Dasein, which Heidegger calls 'existence' (Existenz), is such 
that Dasein in its being has - or better is - a relationship of being to this
being. Understanding of being belongs to Dasein's being. Dasein is the
subject-matter of phenomenology because it is the understanding of being.
In so far as it is, Dasein understands its own being (existence), but in
understanding its own being it at the same time understands the being of
entities other than itself. An understanding of the being of entities of 
a character other than its own is constitutive of Dasein's own under-
standing of existence. Just as Zuhandensein - or rather an understanding
of Zuhandensein - is a condition of the possibility of comportment to
equipment, so too an understanding of my own being, existence, is a condi-
tion of the possibility of comporting myself to myself, which Heidegger
thinks I do even in comporting myself to things other than myself. In the
Marburg lectures referred to earlier he speaks of the co-disclosedness
(Mitenthülltsein) of the self in having to do with things. 'The self is there
for Dasein itself without reection and without inner perception, before
all reection.'8 The Da in Da-sein is disclosedness (Erschlossenheit) of
HEIDEGGER'S PHENOMENOLOGY

being. Dasein is the disclosedness of being. It is the disclosedness of exis-
tence, but as the disclosedness of existence it is also the disclosedness of
readiness-to-hand and presence-at-hand or occurrentness (Vorhandensein),
and whatever other modes of being there are.
2 Realist Phenomenology 
The maxim to which Heidegger refers in explicating the formal concep-
tion of phenomenology - 'To the things themselves!' - originates in
Husserl. It became the rallying cry of those phenomenologists who nowa-
days would be called realist phenomenologists and whose main source of
inspiration was Husserl's Logical Investigations.9 Paradoxically, one of the
best presentations of this kind of phenomenology is to be found in
Husserl's Ideas, the work in which his phenomenology rst emerged in
its fully-edged transcendental and idealistic form. I refer to Section One
of that work, 'Essence and Knowledge of Essence'.10 This type of phenom-
enology is characterized by a rich ontology (understood as the theory of
what there is) which rejects the empiricist restriction of entities to the
physical and mental. There are material objects and thoughts, feelings,
mental acts, but there are also numbers, states of affairs (Sachverhalte),
logical laws, institutions, persons, works of art, and so on. Such entities
are what they are and are not reducible to some other thing. Following
the maxim 'To the things themselves!', entities, of whatever ontological
type, are to be taken as they present themselves to consciousness and not
as some theory or system says they must be. Every entity has its 'what',
its essence (Wesen). Essences are not simply the reection of how we use
words but objectively existing ideal objects. Moreover, they are not merely
objects of thought but can, in a manner, be perceived. Phenomenology is
the study of essences and relations between essences by means of
Wesensschau, a kind of non-sensory seeing or intuiting of essences. The
essential truths which such phenomenology lays bare are a priori, and
because everything has its essence the a priori is not restricted to the
merely formal but can pertain to literally anything: e.g. there are a priori
truths about sensation. Moreover, the necessity which characterizes a priori
truths has nothing to do with how we think or even how we must think,
but is purely objective. Although considerable emphasis is given by realist
phenomenology to the intentionality of consciousness, and intentional
experiences (Erlebnisse) constitute much of its subject-matter, this is not
because it is thought that somehow things other than consciousness depend
for their existence and character on consciousness. Rather the failure to
recognize intentionality, properly to distinguish between consciousness and
what one is conscious of, is thought to underlie most forms of reduc-
tionism. Thus, the failure to distinguish between the sensations involved
in perception and the object of perception is responsible for attempts to
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
20

reduce material objects to 'bundles' of sensations. The failure to distin-
guish between thinking as a psychical process and what is being thought
about leads to the confusion of laws of logic with psychological laws.
Similarly, the failure to recognize intentionality leads to the reduction of
values to feelings.
3 Transcendental Phenomenology of Consciousness
Whether Husserl himself was ever a phenomenologist of the realist kind
is a matter for debate. What is beyond doubt is that in his hands phenom-
enology became something very different. For transcendental phenome-
nology consciousness is the exclusive theme. Given that this is so, the
method of transcendental phenomenology is necessarily reective. In what
Husserl calls the natural attitude, consciousness is ordinarily absorbed in
its objects. In phenomenological reection, by contrast, there is a turning
away from the entities toward which consciousness is directed to conscious-
ness itself and its intentional directedness toward entities. Perceiving the
tree in the garden is an example of what Husserl calls an intentional expe-
rience. In the natural attitude the focus of concern is the tree and not my
perceptual awareness of the tree. But Husserl thinks that it belongs to
the essence of intentional experiences that they can themselves become
objects of a second-order act of reection. So sticking to the example just
given, it is possible to direct our consciousness to the perceiving itself 
and its perceptual directedness to the tree. Such reection, it should be
stressed, is not a case of thinking but of 'seeing'. But what has been said
so far is not enough to distinguish phenomenological reection from the
sort of reection that occurs in ordinary life. Such ordinary reection takes
place within the natural attitude and on the basis of what Husserl calls
the 'general thesis' of the natural attitude, the implicit, taken-for-granted
belief in the real existence of the world. In such ordinary reection,
although attending to my consciousness I, implicily at least, understand
myself to be a psychophysical entity in the world.
In phenomenological reection, by contrast, the general thesis of the
natural attitude, together with all the particular positings of real existence
based on the general thesis - including the positing of myself as a
psychophysical entity - are suspended, put out of action. This radical mode
of reection on consciousness does not involve the denial of the inten-
tionality or object-directedness of consciousness. An epoche¯ is carried out
with respect to both the existence and the properties of the object, but
the object remains as a purely intentional object, the object qua object of
consciousness. Whether or not it actually exists and actually has the prop-
erties it is intended as having, it is intended as existing and as having
such-and-such properties. The object qua intended survives the phenom-
enological epoche¯. In phenomenological reection consciousness is no
HEIDEGGER'S PHENOMENOLOGY
21

longer viewed as in the world or as part of an entity that is in the world,
but phenomenologically 'reduced' consciousness can still be said to 'have'
a world in the sense that despite the 'putting out of action' of the general
thesis (the phenomenological reduction) the world as the universal horizon
of all experienced items remains as the intentional correlate of my
conscious life. 
The consciousness to which access is gained through the phenomeno-
logical reduction, consciousness with its structure ego-cogito-cogitatum 
(or I-noesis-noema), does not, as Heidegger might have expressed it,
primarily and for the most part show itself.11 It must be made to show
itself. But though it does not 'naturally' show itself, once it is made to
show itself it can be seen to be the ground of what primarily and for the
most part does show itself. The entities toward which we are directed in
our intentional experiences, and which in the natural attitude are simply
there for us, are 'constituted' in transcendental consciousness. Their being
there for us is on the basis of an ordered multiplicity of appearances,
perspectival views or adumbrations (Abschattungen), which are themselves
the 'result' of the 'animation' (Beseelung) of sensations or hyletic data 
by 'acts' of meaning. Sensations themselves are constituted in internal
time-consciousness.
4 Husserl and Heidegger: Radicalization or Rejection?
My principal aim is to understand Heidegger, specically his conception
of phenomenology. It is in pursuit of this aim that I have looked at the
realist phenomenology inspired by the Logical Investigations and at
Husserl's transcendental phenomenology. Placing Heidegger's phenome-
nology in relation to them helps to shed light on its nature. But I want
in particular to look at how Heidegger stands in relation to Husserl's tran-
scendental phenomenology.
Heidegger's phenomenology is a phenomenology of Dasein, whereas
Husserl's phenomenology is a phenomenology of consciousness. But this
does not mean that Heidegger is in any way denying consciousness, that
he is advocating some kind of behaviourism. He has no wish to deny the
obvious truth that human beings are conscious. In being conscious human
beings are directed to this or that. It may be that in his descriptions 
of intentionality Heidegger prefers the term 'comportment' (Verhalten,
Verhaltung ) to 'experience' (Erlebnis), but Husserl also sometimes uses
Verhalten. And it is true that in his analyses of sense-perception Heidegger
emphasizes its practical involvement rather more than Husserl does.12 But
the fact remains that what he, Heidegger, is talking about is a form of
awareness or consciousness. It may be that perception presupposes an
engaged having-to-do-with things, but this is not at all the same as denying
that there is such a thing as perceptual awareness.To treat perception as
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
22

such as a modication of having-to-do-with (Besorgen) would be absurd,
inasmuch as having-to-do-with itself already essentially involves percep-
tion. Or is Heidegger suggesting that I can manipulate things, work with
things, without seeing them, feeling them, hearing them? What is true, in
Heidegger's view, is that pure perception, in which I simply behold an
object with its sensible qualities, is a decient mode of engaged perception.
So, given that Heidegger does not deny that there is such a thing as
consciousness, how should we understand the relationship between his
phenomenology of Dasein and Husserl's phenomenology of conscious-
ness? There would seem to be a number of possibilities. One is that all
they have in common is phenomenology in the formal sense: the letting
be seen of that which shows itself. Their respective 'phenomena' bear no
relation to each other.This does not seem at all plausible. Heidegger
constantly insists that you cannot separate a method from that to which
it is applied. If Husserl's subject-matter (consciousness) bore no relation
to Heidegger's (Dasein), then one simply could not take seriously
Heidegger's claim to have learned phenomenological seeing from Husserl.
It is possible to argue that Heidegger's phenomenology is neither just
doing something different nor repudiating Husserlian phenomenology but
is a radicalizing and deepening of the latter. On this view intentional
analysis is acceptable to Heidegger as an account of the constitution of
objects in consciousness, or in Heideggerian terms of how entities show
themselves. But such constitution is grounded in something deeper. What
makes possible the constitution (Konstitution) of objects in consciousness
is the ontological constitution (Verfassung) of Dasein. Dasein is under-
standing of being, disclosedness of being. The exhibiting (Aufweisend),
letting be seen, of this disclosedness is precisely what Heidegger's phenom-
enology claims to provide. Husserl's phenomenology, on this view, is all
right as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. On this view of the
relationship it would not be a waste of time to do Husserlian phenome-
nology, though only to do it would be a sign of arrested development.
An understanding of being belongs to the being of Dasein, so the
phenomenology of the being of this being or entity is fundamental
ontology. In Heidegger's opinion Husserl provides an acceptable account
of the structure of intentionality but fails to explain how intentionality is
possible. To do this, according to Heidegger, we must turn our attention
to the entity that is intentional, the 'bearer' of intentionality; but not to
its 'properties' but to its being, a being which includes an understanding
of the being of beings other than itself. For Husserl the entity that is inten-
tional, is directed toward entities, is consciousness.
In what he calls the 'analytic of Dasein' Heidegger claims to be laying
bare or 'letting be seen' the fundamental structures of the being of Dasein,
and because he uses the term 'existence' (Existenz) to refer to the mode
of being peculiar to that entity which I myself am, he calls such structures
HEIDEGGER'S PHENOMENOLOGY
23

'existentials'. To understand the relationship between Heidegger and
Husserl the existential, what we must concentrate on is what he calls 'being-
in-the-world'. The being of the intentional being or entity, Dasein, is 
being-in-the-world. This does not refer to the fact that the totality of what
is - which is what is ordinarily meant by 'world' - includes entities with the
remarkable property of being directed toward other entities. So perhaps
we should say that Dasein is in the world in the sense that the intentional
being (Dasein) is itself intentionally related to the world in the sense of the
totality of what is. In other words we would be saying that, just as there
can be comportment to entities or collections of entities, so there can be
comportment to the totality of entities. But to construe being-in-the-world
is this way would clearly be a mistake. What the 'in' refers to is not itself 
an intentional relation but a condition of the possibility of intentional 
relations (including an intentional relation to the totality of entities).
But then neither does Husserl regard the relationship between
consciousness and the world as an intentional relation in any straightfor-
ward sense. Weltbewusstsein should not be understood as consciousness
of a great big object. For Husserl 'world' is the 'horizon' rather than the
object of consciousness. Particular experienced items, as experienced, have
an inner and outer horizon.13 The inner horizon consists of the aspects of
the object not currently perceived but of which the subject is co-conscious
in their explicit consciousness of the perceived aspects. The outer horizon
consists of surrounding objects not currently in the subject's perceptual
eld, but ultimately of the totality of objects, the world, the universal
horizon. The world for Husserl is not the totality of objects as such but
the totality of objects as universal horizon. 
That consciousness of particular items involves this universal horizon is
not regarded by Husserl as a contingent feature of consciousness. It belongs
to the essence of consciousness. Just as Heidegger's being-in-the-world is
a condition of the possibility of intentionality or comportment to entities,
so too, it would seem, Husserl's Weltbewusstsein (consciousness's having
a universal horizon) is a condition of the possibility of consciousness of
particular items. Because world-consciousness belongs to the essence
of consciousness of particular items, the latter is impossible without the
former. However, when Heidegger speaks in Kantian terms of being-
in-the-world as being a 'condition of the possibility' of comportment to
entities he does not just mean that you cannot have one without the other,
in the sense that you cannot have a triangle the sum of whose angles is
not equal to the sum of two right angles. Being-in-the-world is a condi-
tion of the possibility of any comportment to entities in the sense that it
makes such comportment possible.
What Heidegger understands by being-in-the-world is the understanding
of being (Sein) what lets entities (Seiendes) show themselves or be encoun-
tered. As we saw earlier, what we encounter most immediately or closely
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
24

(das nächstbegegnende Seiende) is the ready-to-hand (das Zuhandene).14
The primary mode of being-in-the-world is not perceiving and knowing
but engagement or concernful having-to-do-with (Besorgen). The being 
of the beings which such comportment is comportment to - readiness-
to-hand (Zuhandenheit, Zuhandensein) - is constituted by their 'for what'
or 'in order to' (Um-zu). To use one of Heidegger's favourite examples,
what a hammer is, is constituted by what it is for, namely, hammering.
This 'reference' (Verweisung) of something to something which consti-
tutes the being of the ready-to-hand belongs to a referential whole
(Verweisungsganzheit). The referential whole is prior to the individual
ready-to-hand entity. Understanding readiness-to-hand as a mode of being
(Sein) is a condition of the possibility of comportment to entities that are
ready-to-hand (Zeug, 'equipment'). 
The being of Dasein is being-in-the-world. But what is 'world'? Is it 
a referential whole out of which individual ready-to-hand entities show
themselves? We saw an example of such a whole at the beginning of this
paper. Another example is given by Heidegger in Being and Time: that
of a room with its writing materials, pen, paper, table, lamp, door, windows,
and so on.15 But this room is itself etwas um-zu, something for. In other
words, this referential-whole is itself part of a wider whole, the university.
So perhaps what Heidegger means by 'world' is the most comprehensive
referential whole. On this view of the matter Heidegger's 'world' would
be a kind of 'practical' equivalent of Husserl's 'world' as universal horizon.
But if we attend to what Heidegger actually says we see that world is
not itself a referential whole, not even the most comprehensive. Rather
it is what makes any referential whole possible. World is disclosed,
Heidegger says, 'in einem Verstehen von so etwas wie Bewendenlassen,
Wobei der Bewandtnis, Womit der Bewandtnis'.16 The problems of trans-
lating Heidegger are well known. What I have just quoted is particularly
difcult. Macquarrie and Robinson translate this as 'understanding such
things as letting something be involved and such things as the "with-which"
and the "in-which" of involvements'. The trouble is that words like
Bewandtnis, Bewenden, and Bewendenlassen are essentially untranslatable.
It is, however, possible to get some idea of what Heidegger is saying
without recourse to them. Bewendenlassen is letting something be encoun-
tered by referring it to its for-what. The Wobei of Bewandtnis is this
for-what, e.g. hammering. The Womit of Bewandtnis is the something which
is for something, in this case the hammer. World is these relations (Bezüge)
in their interconnection. The disclosedness of world, the prior disclosed-
ness of world, is what makes any comportment to . . . possible. The
disclosedness of world is the understanding of the relations constitutive
of any referential whole.
Without an understanding of world there can be no understanding of
readiness-to-hand. Comportment to entities which are ready-to-hand is only
HEIDEGGER'S PHENOMENOLOGY
25

possible on the basis of an understanding of being. Comportment to entities
as such (Seiendes) is only possible on the basis of an understanding of being
(Sein). Readiness-to-hand is a mode of being. But what about other modes
of comportment to entities? Specically, what about modes of comportment
directed toward the present-at-hand (Vorhandenes), mere 'things'? Since
being-in-the-world is a condition of the possibility of any comportment to
what is, it must also be a condition of the possibility of comportment to the
present-at-hand. Heidegger would have it that such 'objectifying' modes of
comportment are modications of the mode of comportment he calls
Besorgen and thus are only possible on the basis of such 'practical' modes of
comportment. 'Practical' comportment is a condition of the possibility of
'theoretical' comportment. But being-in-the-world is a condition of the 
possibility of 'practical' comportment. So being-in-the-world is also a 
condition of the possibility of 'theoretical' comportment. But however we
understand this, it is important to see that Heidegger is not asserting an ontic
dependence of the present-at-hand on the ready-to-hand, the dependence
of one sort of entity on another sort of entity. Rather he is claiming that
being able to encounter things as simply there, present-at-hand (vorhanden),
presupposes an understanding of readiness-to-hand (Zuhandenheit). 
He is talking about an ontological dependence of Vorhandenheit on
Zuhandenheit, not an ontic dependence of entity on entity.
If we do not make this distinction between ontic dependence and onto-
logical dependence then Heidegger will be seen to be advocating a rather
ridiculous form of anthropological idealism. Something ready-to-hand can
only be within the context of a referential whole. But a referential whole
is 'anchored' in something which is not for something but is what
Heidegger, possibly with the Kantian end-in-itself in mind, calls a 'for-
the-sake-of-which' (Worumwillen). This is Dasein with its possibilities of
being. Presence-at-hand is grounded in readiness-to-hand. So it would
seem that if there is nothing ready-to-hand then there is nothing present-
at-hand. But Dasein is not a necessary being. If there were no Dasein
there would be nothing ready-to-hand. So if there were no Dasein then,
because presence-at-hand is grounded in readiness-to-hand, there would
be nothing present-at-hand, no 'things', no substance, no reality. But
understanding Heidegger in this way is to fail to grasp what is dependent
on Dasein. Dasein with its understanding of the constitutive relations of
referential wholes (disclosedness of world) is the condition of the possi-
bility of the 'dis-coverability' (Entdeckbarkeit) of entities whose mode of
being is readiness-to-hand. And because the understanding of presence-
at-hand presupposes the understanding of readiness-to-hand, Dasein is
also the condition of the possibility of the dis-coverability of entities whose
mode of being is presence-at-hand. But this does not mean that one sort
of entity (Vorhandenes, things) depends for the fact that it is on the fact
that the other sort of entity (Dasein) is.

5 Transcendental Philosophy and the Question of the 
Meaning of Being
The Heidegger of Being and Time is a transcendental philosopher in the
sense that he enquires into the conditions of the possibility of comport-
ment to entities. His transcendentalism is more radical than that of Kant
and Husserl because he asks: how is comportment to entities - not just
cognitive comportment but any comportment to entities - possible? He
seeks to show how an understanding of being is a condition of the possi-
bility of comportment to entities. But his transcendental questioning goes
even deeper. For he also asks: how is an understanding of being possible?
The answer he gives to this question is in terms of time. In so far as he
has one, this can also be seen as his answer to the question of the meaning
of being.
The being of Dasein is being-in-the-world. But this is not the whole
story. Heidegger's complete account of the being of Dasein is encapsu-
lated in the statement: The being of Dasein is care (Sorge). As a statement
of existential ontology this says nothing about which affective states are
most prevalent. People with a care-free disposition in the ordinary sense
of the term are just as much characterized by care in the ontological 
sense as naturally gloomy people. As Heidegger uses it 'care' is a tech-
nical term which designates the three principal structures of Dasein's being
in their essential unity. These are projection (Entwerfen), thrownness
(Geworfenheit) and concern (Besorgen). In projecting itself on to possi-
bilities of being-in-the-world Dasein is 'ahead of itself'. As thrown, Dasein
is already in-the-world. As already in-the-world it is bei entities within-
the-world (innerweltlich Seiendes). It dwells with entities within-the-world,
is absorbed by them. But although 'care' is a technical term which means
nothing more than these three basic structures of the being of Dasein in
their essential interconnection, it is not chosen arbitrarily. Its ontic meaning
helps to convey the idea that Dasein is not a detached subject contem-
plating the world but is such that its being is an issue for it ('es geht
diesem Seienden in seinem Sein um dieses Sein'), and that the way in
which its being is an issue for it is inseparable from its engagement with
entities within-the-world.
The being of Dasein is care. But the question for which Heidegger is
seeking an answer is the question of the meaning of being (Sinn von Sein)
as such, not the apparently more limited question of the meaning of the
being of Dasein. The answer to this latter question is in a sense the key
to the answer to the Seinsfrage as such, though not in the sense that 
the being of human beings is to serve as the model for the being of all
other entities; it is not itself an answer to the Seinsfrage. In fact we do
not yet have an answer even to the more limited question. For this we
would have to know what the meaning or sense of 'care' is. In the ordinary
HEIDEGGER'S PHENOMENOLOGY
27

sense of 'meaning' we have already been told this. But what Heidegger
means by Sinn (sense or meaning) is: that on the basis of which the being
of Dasein is to be understood. This 'on the basis of which', the horizon
which makes possible the being of Dasein as care, is what he calls 'tempo-
rality' (Zeitlichkeit). 
To see what this means we must start with the common or ordinary
(vulgär) conception of time, according to which time is a unidirectional,
irreversible, beginningless and endless sequence of 'nows'.17 The not-yet-
now becomes the now, and the now becomes the no-longer-now. Only the
now is real. Heidegger is not saying that there is 'no such thing' as time
thus conceived. He does, however, claim that it is 'derivative' in the sense
of being grounded in something more basic. This is the time of Dasein,
what he calls original time, or temporality (Zeitlichkeit). But he does not
go straight from common time to original time. Between common time
and original time is time as we actually encounter it. Whereas in his treat-
ment of time Husserl focuses on an essentially private datum, a sensation,
Heidegger approaches time through our 'reckoning with' time, 'taking
account' of time, time as it shows itself in the use of clocks and watches.18
An example of 'taking account' of time would be looking at my watch to
see how much time there is till the end of my lecture. I use my watch 
to determine how much time I still have to do this or that. Time encoun-
tered in this way is time to . . . , time for . . . , time in order to . . . . 'The
time that is always already given to us so far as we take time and take
account of time has the character of "time in order to . . ."'.19 Heidegger
calls this 'structural moment' of time 'signicance' (Bedeutsamkeit).
Another feature of the now of the time encountered in taking account
of it is what he calls 'datability' (Datierbarkeit). It is now, when such 
and such. Likewise 'then' (dann, which refers to something not yet) 
is always then, when such and such . . ., and 'then' in the sense of 'at-the-
time' (damals) is then, when such and such. There is also what he calls 
the 'spannedness' (Gespanntheit) of time. Now, then, at-the-time, are not
points. Now, for example, is 'now during the lecture' or 'now during 
the break'. Finally, there is what Heidegger calls the 'publicness'
(Öffentlichkeit) of time. 'Although each one of us utters his own now it is
nevertheless the now for everyone. The now is accessible to everyone and
thus belongs to no one.'20
Time with these structures of signicance, datability, spannedness, and
publicness is time as we encounter it in taking account of it. Time as a
uniform sequence of nows is an abstraction from time with these struc-
tures. But there is something more basic than this concrete time of
'everyday' experience, something which makes it possible. This is an inter-
connection of modes of comportment which Heidegger calls 'expecting'
(Gewärtigen), 'retaining' (Behalten), and 'enpresenting' (Gegenwärtigen).21
'Then' expresses the expecting of something, 'at-the-time' the retaining of

28

something, 'now' the enpresenting of something. If time with its now, at-
the-time, then, expresses an enpresenting, retaining, and expecting, then
these comportments in their unity constitute time in a more original sense.
Each of them makes possible one of the components of care, and in their
unity they make care as such, and therefore the being of Dasein, possible.
Dasein understands itself in terms of its ability to be (Seinkönnen). In
comporting itself toward an ability to be, or possibility of being, Dasein
projects itself on to this possibility and is in this sense ahead of itself.
Projecting myself on to a possibility ('expecting' it, in Heidegger's termi-
nology; although this term is reserved for inauthentic projection) 'I come
from this possibility toward that which I myself am.'22 Dasein, 'expecting'
(anticipating) its ability to be, comes toward itself. In this coming-toward-
itself Dasein is 'futural' (zukünftig) in an original sense. This original sense
of the future is the presupposition of the common concept of the future
in the sense of the not-yet-now.
In retaining, Dasein comports itself toward what it itself has already
been. This having-been-ness (Gewesenheit) does not mean that Dasein no
longer is; rather Dasein is what it was. Everything we have been is an
essential determination of our existence. When Dasein no longer is, it also
no longer has been. In coming toward itself from out of a possibility of
itself it also always comes back to what it has been. 
The present in the existential sense is not the same as presence or as
presence-at-hand (Vorhandenheit). Dasein, in existing, is always dwelling
with (bei) ready-to-hand entities. It has such entities in its present. 
In enpresenting it is not a case of making something already present
perceptually present. Rather it is letting entities presence, emerge into
unconcealedness.23
Original time or temporality (Zeitlichkeit) is this coming-toward-itself,
coming-back-to-itself, and enpresenting, in their essential interconnection.
Such temporality is ecstatic, inasmuch as in the toward, back-to and with
(bei), temporality has the character of being outside itself. Heidegger calls
this outside itself of temporality ecstasis, and the future, past (having-been-
ness, Gewesenheit), and present of original temporality the three ecstases
of temporality. But this 'movement' outside itself, this ecstasis of tempo-
rality, is not a directionless movement 'as it were into the nothing',24 but
has a 'whereto', which he calls the horizon or horizonal schema of the
ecstasis. It is for this reason that Heidegger calls the original temporality
of Dasein ecstatic-horizonal temporality.
The being of Dasein is care. In the ecstatic-horizonal temporality just
described we supposedly have an answer to the question of the meaning
or sense of the being of Dasein. As far as Being and Time is concerned,
this is all we get, explicitly at least. The answer to the more fundamental
question of the meaning of being as such was to have been provided in
Division Three, 'Time and Being'. Although Heidegger wrote this section,
HEIDEGGER'S PHENOMENOLOGY
29

he appears to have found it unsatisfactory. The decision not to go ahead
with its publication, he reveals in lectures on Schelling and the meta-
physics of German Idealism delivered in 1941, was made at the end of
December 1926 during a visit to his friend Karl Jaspers in Heidelberg.25
What he had written, he surmised, would not be understood. There 
is some evidence that the Marburg lectures of 1927 were intended as 
a substitute. The most they give us, however, is a somewhat obscure
temporal interpretation of the mode of being he calls 'readiness-to-hand'
(Zuhandenheit). The crucial 'ecstasis' for this interpretation is that of
enpresenting (Gegenwärtigen). For the horizonal schema of this ecstasis
he uses the Latin name praesens. 'That which lies beyond the ecstasis as
such, due to the character of the ecstasis and as determined by that char-
acter, or, more precisely, that which determines the whither of the "beyond
itself" as such in general, is praesens as horizon. The present projects itself
within itself ecstatically upon praesens.'26 The ecstasis of the present in
unity with those of future and past (having-been-ness) projects readiness-
to-hand as such on to the horizon of praesens.
If all that was meant by 'being as such' were the being of entities that
are not of the character of Dasein (nichtdaseinsmäßiges Seiendes), then,
to the extent that it can be understood, this would provide at least a partial
answer to the question of the meaning of being as such. What would still
be needed would be a temporal interpretation of the being of the present-
at-hand, the being of living things, the being of works of art, the being of
ideal entities, and so on. If, on the other hand, we mean by 'being as such'
what unies all the various modes of being, including that of Dasein, then
even the published part of Sein und Zeit can be said to provide a kind of
answer to the question of the meaning of being as such. The meaning 
of being as such is time (in the sense of ecstatic-horizonal temporality).
The understanding of being is temporal because the being of Dasein is
temporal. But being as what-is-understood in the understanding of being
is itself temporal. For at this stage of Heidegger's thinking being (Sein)
is not something over and above the understanding of being.
6 Phenomenology in the Later Heidegger
Whether we regard Heidegger's phenomenology of Dasein as a radical-
ization or as a repudiation of Husserl's transcendental phenomenology,
the fact remains that Heidegger himself eventually abandoned the 
project of transcendental philosophy. The Dasein of Being and Time
remains too close to the subject of modern philosophy. However, this does
not mean that the concept of phenomenology is only relevant to early
Heidegger. I shall conclude by briey considering, from this perspective,
a work representive of the later Heidegger: 'The Question Concerning
Technology'.
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
30

Heidegger's lecture27 is concerned with the 'essence' (Wesen) of tech-
nology. Now just as the essence of 'tree' is 'not itself a tree that can be
encountered among all the other trees',28 so the essence of technology is
not itself something technological. This would be true even if Heidegger's
understanding of Wesen were the standard one, according to which it
means what something is, its what-ness. What a tree is, is not itself a tree.
But what Heidegger understands by essence in this context is the under-
standing of being which makes technology possible. In the ordinary sense
of 'essence' it is clear that technology is a human activity and a means to
an end. By specifying what kind of activity it is and what kind of ends it
realizes, and by what means, one would have given its essence. Now one
can say of this activity and its products that they profoundly inuence
every area of human life, so that it is not surprising that people call this
age the 'age of technology'. One may think that technology is entirely
benecial to mankind or, more sensibly, that it brings both benets and
harms. One may reect that although it is a human activity, it is one which
is beyond the control of individuals, perhaps even of the human race. And
this may lead one even to demonize technology. But this is not what inter-
ests Heidegger. There is a sense in which, for Heidegger, technology is
the supreme danger to man. The essence of technology, in the Heideggerian
sense, is the supreme danger because it prevents us from having a proper
understanding of our own being. The essence of technology, in the sense
of the understanding of being which makes it possible, is such as to exclude
other ways of understanding being, for instance those involved in creating
and engaging with works of art. It is not just understanding being, but
understanding being in manifold ways which makes us human.
The essence of technology, in the Heideggerian sense of what makes 
it possible, is what he calls Ge-stell, enframing. Enframing is not an 
activity in any ordinary sense, nor is it itself something technological. It
is a way of understanding being or what Heidegger also calls a way 
of revealing (Entbergen). The essence of technology, Ge-stell, is a way of
revealing (disclosing, uncovering, bringing out of concealment) of what is
as Bestand (standing-reserve). It is a distinctive feature of Heidegger's
philosophy that all ways of having to do with things, all modes of comport-
ment to entities, and not just perception and observation, let things show
themselves in some way. But, as we have seen, what lets things show them-
selves is what normally does not show itself. What lets things show
themselves is the understanding of being. 
Although profoundly inuenced by Hegel and Schelling, at no stage on
his Denkweg does Heidegger take himself to be constructing a system.
Thinking is dictated by the matter, the things themselves (die Sachen
selbst). The explicitly phenomenological thinking of Being and Time issues
in statements about human being and its structures. If we now ask: how
does Heidegger know that these statements are true?, we must rst bear
HEIDEGGER'S PHENOMENOLOGY
31

in mind that Heidegger understands by a true statement one which lets
something be seen as it is, rather than as one which 'corresponds' with a
fact. We can then say that he knows what he says is true because he is
able to let human being and its structures be seen. For us then to accept
that what he says is true it is not enough simply to read his words and
sentences; we must ourselves 'see' the matter they disclose, that is to say
we must read the text phenomenologically.
But if we now ask: how does Heidegger know that what he says about
the essence of technology is true? things become more difcult. I have
talked about enframing as though it were simply an understanding of
being. As such it would not be a human activity but something which
makes a human activity possible. But as a mode of understanding it 
would still be something about us. The question of whether we do under-
stand reality as Bestand, standing-reserve, is one that can in principle be
answered. The claim is open to phenomenological verication. The
problem is, however, that according to Heidegger enframing is not just an
understanding of being. It is also what he calls ein Geschick, a sending.
As an understanding (a revealing, uncovering, disclosing) it is something
about human beings. But that we understand being in the ways we do,
according to Heidegger, is not of our making. Ways of understanding
being, ways of revealing, are necessary because what-is-understood in the
understanding of being - being itself - sends them. In understanding being
Dasein is being used by being. It is claims of this kind which resist any
kind of phenomenological verication. If Heidegger were using 'being' as
another term for God, then claims about what being 'does' to and with
human beings would still not be open to phenomenological verication,
but they might be open to some other kind of verication or justication.
But even if this were so, it would be no help to Heidegger, for to equate
being with God would be to ignore the ontological difference. Being (Sein)
is not any kind of being (Seiendes), not even the supreme being.

Heidegger's analysis of the temporality of Dasein is by far the most difcult
part of his fundamental ontology. The account given in Part Two of Basic
Problems is somewhat more accessible than that given in Division Two of
Being and Time.
18
To what extent Heidegger was inuenced by Husserl's phenomenology of
time-consciousness is difcult to say. Heidegger edited Husserl's 1905 lectures,
but by the time Husserl gave him the manuscripts Sein und Zeit was already
at the printers. Their respective approaches to the subject are certainly very
different.
