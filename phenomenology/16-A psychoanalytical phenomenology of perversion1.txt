A psychoanalytical phenomenology of perversion1

(Final version accepted 1 July 2003)
After stating that the current tasks of psychoanalytic research should fundamentally include 
the exploration of the analyst's mental processes in sessions with the patient, the author 
describes the analytical relation as one having an intersubjective nature. Seen from the 
outside, the analytical relation evidences two poles: a symmetric structural pole where both 
analyst and patient share a single world and a single approach to reality, and a functional 
asymmetric pole that de nes the assignment of the respective roles. In the analysis of 
a perverse patient, the symmetry-asymmetry polarities acquire some very particular 
characteristics. Seen from the perspective of the analyst's subjectivity, perversion appears 
in the analyst's mind as a surreptitious and unexpected transgression of the basic agreement 
that facilitates and structures intersubjective encounters. It may go as far as altering the 
Aristotelian rules of logic. When coming into contact with the psychic reality of a perverse 
patient, what happens in the analyst's mind is that a world takes shape. This world is 
misleadingly coloured by an erotisation that sooner or later will acquire some characteristics 
of violence. The perverse nucleus, as a false reality, remains dangling in mid-air as an 
experience that is inaccessible to the analyst's empathy. The only way the analyst can reach 
it is from the 'periphery' of the patient's psychic reality, by trying in an indirect way to lead 
him back to his intersubjective roots. At this point, the author's intention is to explain this 
intersubjective phenomenon in terms of metapsychological and empirical research-based 
theories. Finally, some ideas on the psychogenesis of perversion are set forth.
Keywords: perversion, psychoanalyst's mind, psychoanalytic phenomenology, 
intersubjective reality, pluralism, mother-baby relationship
Many researchers have studied the theme of perversion in psychoanalytical terms 
and written originally on it. In this paper I would like to present certain ideas about a 
circumscribed aspect that refers to how perversion appears2 in the intersubjective  eld 
of the analytical relation; that is, how it gets to be a psychic reality in the analyst's 
mind. Subsequently, I will endeavour to relate this phenomenological approach with 
metapsychological theories about perversion.
Before dealing with this topic, I must follow a particular path to clarify this manner 
of approaching perversion from intersubjective reality. This concept is borrowed 
from phenomenology (see Landgrebe, 1963) and was introduced to Latin American 
psychoanalysis by Willy and Madelaine Baranger (W Baranger and M Baranger, 1969; 
M. Baranger et al., 1983; M. Baranger, 1993).
The crisis of the consensus and the present tasks psychoanalytical research faces
In the past decade, we have witnessed the public crisis of the consensus and the 
declaration of pluralism as an irreducible reality in psychoanalysis (Wallerstein, 1988, 
1A less developed version was presented to the Panel: Perversion and psychic Reality. 39th IPAC, San Francisco, 1995.
2Etymologically, the word 'phenomenon' comes from the Latin phaenomenon, and this from the Greek f a í n w , to 
appear. Thus etymologically 'phenomenology' would be the study of how things 'appear'.

1990; Bernardi 1989; Hamilton, 1997; Fonagy et al., 1999; Thomä, 2000). Even so, 
the existing consensus regarding the exclusive character of the analytical situation as 
the platform for generating and validating psychoanalytical hypotheses continues to be 
broad, although the suf ciency of the clinical method as the only path for validation of 
hypotheses generated in the analytical situation is the subject of controversy (Thomä and 
Kächele, 1975; Rubovits-Seitz, 1992; Jiménez, 2001).
In his concern to found a 'hard' science, Freud thought that he saw the basic norms 
regulating analytical activity as fundaments that assured the unfolding of the patient's 
psychic activity in the transference, wholly uncontaminated by the analyst's subjectivity. 
Despite this, from the beginning the analyst's subjectivity manifested itself, especially 
in scienti c exchanges between colleagues. Different authors, the creators of the most 
diverse approaches and conceptions, have always claimed that their ideas came from 
unmediated experience with their patients. Ferenczi's (1928) hope that theoretical 
and technical differences in psychoanalysis would be eliminated by the introduction 
of the training analysis remained unful lled. At this point we know that in principle a 
consensus based on the ideal of scienti c-natural objectivity cannot be achieved. The 
analytical situation is not a 'neutral social situation'; instead, the participation of the 
analyst's persona (personality, personal history, 'personal equation', countertransference, 
personal theory, school of thought, cosmological vision and latent anthropology etc.) is 
an intrinsic constituent of the situation as such. On the other hand, in psychoanalytical 
theoretical building there appears to be, from Freud, some confusion between the 
experiential dimension of the analytical situation—where colloquial language provides 
the best level of description—and the most abstract metapsychological descriptions. 
This confusion, which may have seemed epistemologically irrelevant at  rst, a hundred 
years later is revealed to be one of the causes that most impairs dialogue between 
analysts, for the differences between these levels of abstraction are not recognised 
and concepts are extended until they lose all speci city. The construction of theory in 
psychoanalysis has reiterated the confusion of Babel. Certainly, the lack of clarity also 
affects the concept of perversion. In the panel on 'Perversion and psychic reality' at the 
San Francisco international congress (1995), Amati-Mehler stated that 'every time the 
word "perversion" is used, we would need a conceptual and clinical rede nition'. To my 
mind, a clinical rede nition requires the application of phenomenology as a method for 
exploring the analytical situation seen as intersubjective reality.
In the beginning, psychoanalysis and phenomenology competed as antagonistic 
disciplines. In the past decade, however, we observe in North American psychoanalysis 
a new rapprochement with phenomenology (see Stolorow and Atwood, 1992).
In a previous paper (Jiménez, 1994, p. 54) I suggested that one of the causes of the 
'Babelisation' of psychoanalysis is to be found in the scant attention paid to the complex 
processes of inference that unfold in the analyst's mind; such processes are one of the 
sources of diversity and pluralism. In the search for the common ground, Wallerstein 
suggests that we must  nd it in 'our clinical enterprise' (1990, p. 7). According to him, 
and despite personal and theoretical differences, what we psychoanalysts would have in 
common, particularly in the practices of our consulting rooms, would be a comparable 
way of relating to our patients in the here and now of the transference-countertransference 
interaction. In any case—and even if one does not entirely agree with this af rmation—here 

67
A PSYCHOANALYTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF PERVERSION
Wallerstein is arguing for a change in the focus of psychoanalytical research, from theory 
(metapsychology) towards practice, and, what is more, change capable of casting light on 
the intimacy of the real consulting room. I would add that what happens in the analyst's 
mind is an essential part of the intimate dimension of the analytical situation.
Intersubjective reality
Psychoanalytical literature teems with contributions on the concept of psychical reality, 
usually as opposed to a speci c external reality that, even so, is rarely de ned. Hartmann 
(1956) (see also Wallerstein, 1983) pointed out that the reality test—which for Freud 
meant the capacity to differentiate ideas and perceptions—should extend its meaning to 
cover also the skill of differentiating objective and subjective elements in our judgement 
of reality. Objective elements are related more to the 'perceptive materiality' of the world 
that surrounds us, that is, to the world of things. For their part, subjective elements refer 
to our more immediate everyday experience. Leaving aside for a moment the relation 
between psychical reality and material reality, a relation that is in any case problematical 
epistemologically, I propose de ning the intersubjective reality as that region of our 
personal or psychic reality that we assume is shared by our fellows. This shared world, 
which is expressed and structured in language, and in some way is the most real of 
worlds, is the human and socialised world of our family life, our job, the world of our 
most immediate everyday experience, in constant and dialectic interaction with our 
feelings and fantasies, our dreams and most unconscious thoughts.
According to this de nition of the intersubjective reality as a shared reality, what 
in psychoanalysis we call a psychical reality would have an idiosyncratic aspect, non-
communicable—really internal—and another communicable aspect, which would also 
be 'external', inasmuch as accessible to the psychical reality of one's fellows. Following 
this argument and reformulating Strachey (1934), the mutative interpretation will delimit 
the  eld of the real in psychical reality, thus expanding, both in the patient's psyche and in 
the relation to the analyst, the domain of the reality test. To assign meaning, to interpret, 
is then to set limits, to discriminate between idiosyncratic, intimate fantasy and what we 
might call 'sharable' fantasy.
From the viewpoint of an external observer, the analytical situation creates a new 
social reality as a  eld of intersubjective agreement between analyst and patient, that 
is, as tacit acknowledgement that both of them, patient and analyst, belong to the 'same 
world'. In this way an intersubjective  eld is con gured where each participant is de ned 
by the other. Bi-corporal contact transcends contact between minds. (In this sense the 
crucial, constituent moment of intersubjectivity would be the moment when the child 
ceases to gaze at his mother's  nger pointing at an object and goes on to look, 'together 
with his mother', towards the object at which she is pointing. At that moment, the 
mother ceases being the child's 'object-world' and passes to 'being part of the world' as 
another subject.) This communion is expressed in the idea of 'same world', to which also 
belongs the materiality of existence, considered in its reference—essential to the human 
being—to 'our world'. The fact of belonging to the same world, to 'our world', de nes 
the symmetrical pole of the intersubjective  eld. However, intersubjective agreement 
also has a functional pole, asymmetrical, de ned by the respective roles of analyst and 

68
JUAN PABLO JIMÉNEZ
patient. The symmetrical-asymmetrical polarity is dynamic and changing—in accordance 
with the conscious and unconscious vicissitudes of both participants. Baranger et al. 
(1983) de ned the bulwark (baluarte) as that situation where the analytical pact's basic 
asymmetry is lost and the interpersonal situation then becomes de ned by unconscious 
symmetrical links wherein patient and analyst engage in inadvertent complicity against 
the analytical process. To advance, the analytical process depends on the functionality 
of its asymmetrical aspects for, if interpreting similarities (symmetry) makes it possible 
to establish and develop transference, interpreting differences (asymmetry) makes it 
possible to resolve transference and, with this, makes the cure possible (Fink, 1989). 
Perverse collusion is paradigmatic of the situation of unconscious complicity against 
the analytic work. This must be quite clear: I believe that the analysis of a pervert is 
structured in such a way that the process proceeds precisely by lifting the bulwarks: in a 
 rst moment, perverse collusion is inevitable. Only a second hearing makes it possible 
to emerge from the entrapment. Ogden proposed a similar idea:
The perverse intersubjective constructions generated in the course of the analysis of 
perversion are, in my experience, inaccessible to the analyst's conscious awareness as they 
are unfolding ... The analyst must in a sense come to understand the perverse transference-
countertransference 'after the fact', i.e. in the course of his doing the psychological work 
required to become aware of his own unconscious experience of and participation in the 
perverse transference-countertransference (1996, p. 1122, fn.).
Perversion and intersubjectivity
From Freud's day (1927), the perverse structure has been characterised by certain properties 
like the splitting of the ego, the denial of castration and the denial of reality (especially 
of sexual differences and generation differences). I believe these metapsychological 
properties are the translation into theory of what in the mind of the analyst appears 
immediately and experientially as a particular dif culty in establishing and maintaining 
the basic intersubjective agreement that sustains the psychoanalytical relation. This 
dif culty does not depend ultimately on the analyst's unresolved countertransference 
problems (though these may be present) but constitutes the characteristic and essential 
feature of the type of intersubjective relation the perverse patient establishes.
Let us adopt for an instant the point of view of the analyst's subjectivity. When he tries 
to put his mind in touch with the mind of the pervert, time and again the analyst will end 
up trapped in a dual relation: on the one hand, the pervert operates in the same world as the 
analyst, they converse back and forth, they share, they work together; on the other hand, 
simultaneously, the pervert seems to inhabit an idiosyncratic universe, a pseudo-reality, a 
world of delusion where the experiences of castration, the experience of the differences 
between human beings and the diversity of realities that makes the world we speak of 
precisely a human world do not exist. This other world, or rather pseudo-world, manifests 
itself as something experientially inaccessible to the patient's fellows, and is what appears 
in the mind of the analyst as the secret that the pervert seems to guard jealously.
Empathy is called into being by 'placing oneself in the place of the other'. In this 
exercise in identi cation and differentiation, we imagine, together with our patients, 

69
A PSYCHOANALYTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF PERVERSION
everyday situations where we look at the world 'through their eyes'. With perverse 
patients this happens in the same way until, to our surprise, we realise that, confronted 
with the speci c situation at hand, the patient is not seeing from the same point of view 
that we are—that, actually, he does not share this 'bit of world' with us.
I quote a paragraph of a paper by Ruth Riesenberg-Malcolm. Speaking of her patient, 
she says,
She was not forthcoming about her reasons for seeking analysis, but said she had been 
advised to come by a family friend. Her principal complaints were a total lack of friends and 
an intense involvement with animals. When speaking about her animals, though she gave 
details about her riding, there was something evasive and secretive in her speech. I remember 
thinking about a possible perversion, though I inferred it more from her tone and nuances 
than from facts explicitly narrated. She expressed a strong desire to be 'like other people', 
and she repeated this several times in a way that conveyed considerable despair (1994, p. 
1033, my italics).
It is usual that perversion should announce itself atmospherically, so to speak, 'from 
the tone and nuances'. This way, it does not directly enter into the intersubjective  eld 
but 'dangles' like a foreign body in the analyst's subjectivity. Even when he knows 
from the outset the characteristics of his patient's perverse acts or fantasies, he will be 
unable to perceive beforehand how these 'colour' the atmosphere of the relation. Once 
the perverse atmosphere is suf ciently identi ed, the analytical work will, in fact, be a 
matter of approaching the perverse nucleus from its periphery, from the vital originating 
experiences that analyst and patient do share. In the brief vignette of treatment offered by 
Riesenberg-Malcolm, the axis hope-despair became what made it possible to construct an 
intersubjective bridge between analyst and patient. The patient was able to communicate her 
fervent desire 'to be like other people', a wish the analyst could empathise with, referring it 
to her own experience—actually, the universal experience—of despair at being isolated.
The persistence of the perverse bulwark is something beyond what formulations in 
the terms of primitive defence mechanisms can describe, for it extends to the surreptitious 
transgression of the rules of logic that constitute the warp and woof of our everyday 
relation with reality, both internal and external. It seems closer to the truth to say that the 
pervert shows us a reality where reality does not exist. Therein lies the deception.
In terms of Matte Blanco's bi-logic (Rayner, 1995), the basic mechanism of 
perversion is 'symmetrisation'. From a bi-logic of intersubjectivity, one could say that, 
just where the analyst expects an asymmetrical judgement, we see, surprisingly and ex 
post facto, that the patient has made a symmetrical judgement. That is, where there should 
have been a difference, what happens, a posteriori, is that the pervert had implied equality 
(i.e. supposed in a cavalier way that he and his analyst shared the same point of view).
In the course of many months of analysis with Matías—a patient who was a fetishist 
and voyeur3—and through different clues he offered in his communication and certain 
failures in logic and misunderstandings that came up in the dialogue, I gradually realised 
that Matías was convinced in a virtually delusional way that I could see his face and 
expression when he was lying back on the couch. This idea concerned me, for I was 
3This patient, whose treatment report was published at length elsewhere (Jiménez, 1993), was in psychoanalysis for 
four years, with a four-times-a-week frequency.

unable to make sense of this way of denying the reality of the perceptual space between 
us. My disquiet grew to the point where I put it to him directly by describing the view 
I had from my armchair: I could see only his hair and part of his forehead, but not his 
face. Matías answered that he did not believe me and that, in fact, I could see his face 
from where I sat, behind the couch. To my surprise, for several sessions he insisted on his 
assertion, adding that every time I said anything to him he was able to imagine perfectly 
the expression on my face. At that moment I understood that the denial was in the service 
of negating the asymmetry with me in the analytical relation, which allowed me to 
formulate the interpretation that the recumbent position was so demeaning to him that 
he simply erased it through the conviction that we continued to sit face to face, as in the 
initial interviews. After this interpretation, Matías appeared to correct the perception of 
denial and we were able to speak about the con ict between omnipotence and impotence, 
where as a rule he felt trapped whenever he established a relation.
To be sure, I was aware from the initial interviews that Matías was suffering from a 
manifest perversion. From the beginning of his analysis I was alert and also expectant, 
trying to discern how the perversion would make itself present in our relation. The 
episode I have just recounted, occurring relatively early in the process, took me entirely 
by surprise and showed me that the alteration perversion embodies is by far more 
profound than I had ever imagined, for it extends to the conditions of intersubjective 
communication themselves, transgressing certain implicit rules of logic that are the 
condition of possibility of dialogue between human beings. Strictly speaking, however, 
in this case the transgression of logic (bi-valent, Aristotelian logic) is nothing but the 
eruption of an anti-logic, symmetrical logic (Rayner, 1995, p. 54).
Matías worked successfully in a branch of engineering closely involved with the 
management of space, but even so he appeared not to share with me an estimate of the 
imaginary space separating us. My interpretation of the denial sought to rechannel the 
symptom into the intersubjective  eld, into the experience of feeling demeaned and 
impotent, experiences that belong to the everyday world of any human being.
It is well known that the perverse atmosphere is impregnated with excitement. In 
Roman Polanski's  lm Bitter moon (1992) a perverse couple seduce a younger couple 
who were experiencing dif culties in their relationship. At the beginning, the seducers 
create an atmosphere charged with suspense and mystery; in the air  oat promises of 
inexhaustible occult pleasures. However, as the drama unfolds, violence in ltrates the 
erotisation in an increasingly manifest way, until the seduced couple react in terror, 
appalled at how they could have allowed themselves to become so deeply enmeshed in 
siren calls that were ultimately revealed to be a trap, a set of lies and a trick. Something 
like that is what happens to the analyst.
During Matías's treatment, there were periods of intense erotisation when his speech 
over owed with allusions that awakened in me sexual fantasies that were varied and 
polymorphic. However, as a rule a moment would come when my arousal would go 
cold, as if doused with cold water. I could not empathise with his complicated way 
of masturbating, in front of a mirror,  rmly tying with a string his erect penis to his 
thorax at breast level, forming a mound over which he placed a brassiere, probably 
stolen beforehand in the neighbourhood. In fact, a spectacle of that nature led me to feel 
discom ture and compassion.

71
A PSYCHOANALYTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF PERVERSION
Becoming distanced from erotisation can happen very quickly if the analyst can put 
his  nger on the countertransference response that had made the relation symmetrical—or 
else take months, even years, as in the following case.
Pedro Y4 came to my consulting room complaining of premature ejaculation, a 
condition that placed his marriage in danger. He explained that at puberty, when he was 
between 12 and 14 years old, he had been seduced innumerable times by his alcoholic 
father. After returning from the long absences his work demanded, the father, while 
telling fascinating stories and drinking, would begin to caress the son; this generally 
ended up with the father on his knees sucking the erect penis of his adolescent son until 
he ejaculated into his father's mouth. Only after two years of analysis did I discover my 
collusion with my patient. Pedro Y was an educated and intelligent man, and he brought 
an abundance of dreams to the sessions. For two years I maintained my interest in his 
dream material, which would germinate in my mind until blossoming into 'brilliant' 
interpretations. After this period, I understood the narcissistic character of the collusion, 
where symbolically we practised mutual 'analytical' oral sex.
Summing up, one could state that perversion appears in the analyst's mind like a 
surreptitious and surprising transgression of the basic agreement that makes possible and 
provides a structure for intersubjective encounter, extending even to the alteration of the 
rules of Aristotelian logic. When coming into contact with the pervert's psychical reality, 
in the analyst's mind a world is con gured whose atmosphere is misleadingly coloured 
by erotisation that sooner or later will acquire some characteristics of violence. The 
perverse nucleus remains, as a false reality, dangling in mid-air like an experience that 
is inaccessible to the analyst's empathy. The only way to reach it is from its 'periphery', 
indirectly, trying to bring it back to its intersubjective roots.
From phenomenology to the explanatory theory (metapsychology)
Let us leave for now the 'comprehensive' moment, a function of the phenomenological 
approach (Verstehenpsychologie), to examine the explanatory moment (Erklärenpsychologie), 
a function of metapsychology. The idea is to understand the particular type of relation 
that I have described above on the basis of the peculiar con guration of the object-world 
of the perverted patient.
In his brief 1927 article on fetishism, Freud provided a new direction for his 
metapsychological ideas about perversion. Supported by new clinical observations, he 
added that the denial of castration implied a splitting of the subject's ego (Ichspaltung). 
This means that the perverse subject has a 'dual attitude' towards reality: on the one 
hand, he af rms castration and, on the other, denies it. As I have tried to show, from the 
intersubjective point of view the relation with the perverse patient is structured, precisely, 
on the basis of this duality.
After Freud, diverse authors have contributed to constructing a theory to explain 
this clinical phenomenon. For Khan (1979), perversion represents a compulsive 
4The treatment report for this patient, who was in psychoanalysis for four years, with a four-times-a-week 
frequency, was published in extenso elsewhere (Jiménez, 1988; Thomä and Kächele, 1988, pp. 343-51). This is 
not, to my mind, a patient with a perverse structure but one with narcissistic and perverse defences in a neurotic 
character structure.

72
JUAN PABLO JIMÉNEZ
attempt to create an experience to conceal and partially substitute the absence of 
the feeling of being alive as a human being. For his part, McDougall (1978, 1986) 
suggested that the perverse patient has a need to generate 'neo-sexualities', in an effort 
to construct a sense of himself, even at the expense of the self and being left with a 
fragmented, defensive and unreal sexuality. Chasseguet-Smirgel (1984) has pointed 
to the omnipotent pretension inherent in denying the limits of sexual possibilities as 
a way of protecting oneself from the terrifying awareness of differences in gender 
and generation. Riesenberg-Malcolm (1970) illustrated clinically and technically 
the idea that the analysis of perversion is not a matter of dissecting the symbolism 
of the perverse act, but of analysing the experience of perversion in the transference 
as it unfolds in the relation with the analyst. Joseph (1971) introduced similar ideas, 
af rming that perversion could only be resolved to the extent that the analyst could 
discover and interpret it in the transference. The erotisation of the relation, the use of 
words or silence to project arousal on to the analyst, passivity to provoke his impatience 
and lead him to act out in interpretation, are all—in Joseph's view—in the service 
not only of getting rid of painful feelings but also of attacking the analyst. On the 
basis of these ideas, Etchegoyen introduced the concept of 'transference perversion' 
as a speci c form that 'endeavours to unify the diverse clinical phenomena that are 
observed in the treatment of this group of patients' (1977, p. 78). For this author, 
transference perversion is characterised by the erotisation of the relation, by a peculiar 
type of narcissistic object relation that permanently tries to construct a delusional 
subject-object unity and by the use of communication to provoke excitement and 
impatience in the analyst. These features accompany the entire therapeutic process, as 
does a polemical and de ant attitude, generally latent, which for Etchegoyen must be 
uncovered and referred to the dissociation of the ego, subject-object confusion and 
the transformation of desire into ideology.
With Ogden (1996) we may conclude that it is now widely accepted that the analysis 
of perversion is not so much a case of decoding and interpreting fantasies, anxiety and 
unconscious defences, acted out in and represented by perverse sexual activity, but, to 
a far greater extent, one of understanding and interpreting the transference phenomena, 
constructed on the foundation of the perverse patient's internal world (Meltzer, 1973). Even 
so, Ogden takes a further step and adds that analysing the perverse transference is only 
possible from an understanding of the intersubjective relation as it unfolds in the analytical 
situation; that is, from understanding and analysing the analyst's countertransference.
On this basis, Ogden proposes a metapsychological theory to account for the 
dynamic movements of the intersubjective phenomenon described above. He starts 
from the commonly accepted psychoanalytic idea that the development of a 'live' 
sense of oneself arises along with the internal conviction that one's parents constitute a 
generative and loving sexual couple. In the perverse patient, by contrast, this conviction 
does not exist; or there is even the contrary, intolerable conviction of a primary scene 
experienced as dead. Perversion then consists of the compulsive and futile effort to extract 
life from a dead couple. Perversion implies a form of excitement derived from the cynical 
subversion of the (alleged) truth of the vitality of the parental coitus, whose source of 
life is experienced as inaccessible and probably non-existent. That is, the parental sexual 
relation, in appearance generative and loving, is experienced as a lie and a fraud. Thus 

73
A PSYCHOANALYTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF PERVERSION
there is a degree of symmetry between generative sexuality and empty sexuality, truth 
and lies. For Ogden, an important method to try to infuse life into the empty primary 
scene is the experience of ' irting with danger'.
At many periods in his life, Matías accomplished incredible feats to get hold of 
brassieres he did not possess and that were an essential part of his perverse ritual. 
Concealed in the darkness of summer nights, he would even manage to clamber up to the 
balconies of the houses of his village, creep through half-open doors into bedrooms where 
couples slept deeply and steal women's brassieres. The mental state of omnipotence, 
during which he never felt fear and was capable of enormous physical effort, in contrast 
to the feeling of disability that generally accompanied him in everyday life, made those 
acts into real 'maniacal orgies'.
While the above-mentioned metapsychological theories make it possible for us 
to gain a degree of insight into the pervert's internal world, to my mind they do not 
manage to explain suf ciently the way perversion surfaces in the intersubjective 
relation. Implicit in these theories is the equivalency of reality and life, and of life 
and truth. Thus, one understands that the pervert presents to us only a 'neo-sexuality', 
in reality a pseudo-sexuality, a false and misleading sexuality, not generative or 
loving. However, if we do not manage to connect metapsychological theories with 
the early processes of communicative interaction between the mother and her infant, 
and these with the interaction between patient and analyst, such theories are at 
risk of being no more than empty metaphors. In this sense, Krause's (1993) ideas 
about the perverse structure offer us a more integrated path between phenomenology 
and metapsychology.
Perversion and the early mother-infant relation
Starting from a reformulation of the concepts of impulse (Trieb) and affect, which brings 
together ideas borrowed from ethology and modern research on development and the 
early mother-child relation, Krause seeks to de ne the characteristics of the perverse 
structure. The de nition of impulse he presents is not based on the erogenous zones but on 
the notion of instinct and the 'genital principle'. In turn, instinct and the genital principle 
are de ned as the 'mute' hierarchical organisational framework of conduct, which 
includes the following elements: motivation, urge and terminal action. In this context, 
affects are understood to be the desires the subject may express with regard to the object. 
Thus, he considers affects to belong to the  eld of urges. As a result of this, he considers 
perverse structures as 'impossible combinations' of affects and urges, on one hand, and 
terminal action on the other. Examples of such impossible combinations are anger and 
voluptuousness (Lust), fear and voluptuousness, or revulsion and voluptuousness. In 
Krause's own words:
Anger, as an affect, belongs to the sphere of the regulation of autonomy. That is why, in 
general, anger, with the propositional structure 'you, object, disappear; I, subject, remain,' is 
not compatible with sexual actions, because the object is rejected. Thus, as long as the anger 
is not counterweighted by another affect, rapprochement with the object cannot be achieved. 
Under the conditions of a sub-group of perversions, which Stoller described as the erotic 

74
JUAN PABLO JIMÉNEZ
form of hatred, the relation between affect and impulse is inverted. The urge 'rage' becomes 
a requirement for any sexual action. Then we have the case of a combination of anger and 
voluptuousness. Depending on how serious the pathology is, this combination can occur in 
the context of erotic play or must be dramatised in the real world. The sexual action is now at 
the service of the regulation of autonomy and ensuring domination and power ... The same 
is true of the relation between anxiety and sexual conduct. In perverse conditions, anxiety 
can become the requirement for sexual sensations and pass into the service of assuring the 
integrity of the self (1993, pp. 192ff.).
Krause explains the combination of disgust and sexual enjoyment, a feature of certain 
perversions, by referring to a second motivational system, the bond:
For a really erotic and sexual experience to be produced, a secure bond is indispensable, 
because empathy with the experience of the other represents the prior condition for the 
dissolution of the I-you limits in orgasm. Normally, the affect 'revulsion' is absolutely 
inhibitory for this type of motivational system because it has a propositional structure (you, 
object, get out of me!), according to which a damaging object, located in the domain of 
the system of the self, is catapulted out of the subject ... A group of serious perversions in 
characterised by the interest in the relation with an object that normally produces massive 
disgust and where disgust produced like this is a condition for sexual action (p. 193).
Let us now consider again the phenomenology of the perverse relation as it unfolds 
in the analytical situation. As stated above, the analyst is disposed to empathise with his 
patient. Indeed, in this process our starting point is the hypothesis that we share the same 
world with the patient. The surprise I described is produced when we encounter any of 
these 'impossible combinations' that prevent us from understanding, 'from the place of 
the other', the relation between the voluptuous desire and anger, anxiety or revulsion, 
as the case may be. At that moment, emotional attunement fractures, like a mirage of 
understanding that disappears abruptly to give way to what is alien, incomprehensible. 
To paraphrase Krause, we can then say that the analyst's empathic identi cation with his 
patient's perverse nucleus is an 'impossible combination'.
Such impossible combinations that pervert the basic levels of the 'natural' relation 
with our body, that is, with our self and others, are, in fact, 'impossible symmetrisations'. 
With regard to the origin of an 'anti-logic' of this sort, Rayner suggests that
many consistent abusers, especially if they make a ritual of it, go to lengths to excite 
themselves and their child victims by systematic perversion of normal logical forms. For 
example, the abuser will often initiate the child into a sort of secret language or code, full 
of innuendo, which is exciting just because it  outs everyday verbal-logical usage. Thus 
the child may be taught that when the abusing adult uses the word 'nasty' it means 'nice', 
and vice-versa; 'good' equals 'bad'; 'bum' equals 'mouth'; 'willy' (penis) means 'tongue'; 
'fanny' (vagina) equals 'bum', and so on. The child is being tempted into symmetrisations 
that are remarkably exciting (1995, p. 54).
Rayner concludes—alluding to the phenomenological nucleus we have described as 
speci c to the perverse structure—by suggesting that 'it is strange for most of us when we 
hear that this simple  outing of logical-linguistic rules has such potential for excitement' 
(p. 54, my italics).

75
A PSYCHOANALYTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF PERVERSION
Now, a psychoanalytical explanation is not complete if it does not include 
developmental psychological considerations, that is, if it does not make clear the conditions 
of its psychogenetic origin. The metapsychological theories I have summarised do not say 
much about the psychogenesis of perversions. Stoller (1975) suggested that the essence 
of perversion is the 'conversion of infantile trauma into adult triumph'. Thus, patients are 
encouraged in their fantasies by the compulsive desire to avenge the infantile traumas 
of humiliation caused by the parents. The perverse method of revenge is to dehumanise 
and humiliate the couple through fantasy or the perverse act. Perverse activity can also 
be understood as a  ight from personal relationships. Perverts have not completed the 
separation or individuation of the intra-psychic representatives of their mothers. In 
consequence, in their identity as separate persons they feel constantly threatened by fusion 
with or being engulfed by external persons or their intra-psychic representations.
Perverse sexuality would then be the terrain where they would af rm their 
independence, so defying the in uence of a despotic maternal imago. This would explain 
the relief perverts feel immediately after carrying out the perverse act, because of the 
feeling of triumph over the internal controlling mother. From Kohut's (1971, 1977) point 
of view, perverse activity is a desperate attempt to re-establish the self's integrity and 
cohesion in the absence of any empathic responses from others. Fantasy or sexual activity 
can help the patient feel alive and intact when faced with a threat of abandonment or 
separation. Perverse behaviour during psychoanalysis can thus be a reaction to failure in 
the therapist's empathy, leading to temporary interruptions in the undifferentiated matrix 
established between patient and therapist.
According to Welldon (1993), the origin of perversions must be understood in the 
context of a perverse mother-child relation, of a mother that abuses her children as if 
they were a part or prolongation of her own body.
Matías's relationship with his mother was enormously ambivalent. On the one hand, he 
claimed to hate her because she was intrusive and domineering; on the other, he said that 
he communicated with his mother wordlessly, felt extremely close to her and knew her as 
well as he knew himself. When he was small, his mother, a seamstress, used to dress him in 
girl's clothing to show the styles to her clients. He would describe a mother who guessed his 
desires, intentions and most intimate fantasies, and who used this knowledge to dominate 
and subjugate him. Certainly, he too claimed to know her even in her intimate being. Thus, a 
symbiotic relationship was con gured between mother and son; indeed, life without her was 
unimaginable for him. The father  gure, by contrast, was much more of a blur. He described 
him as a person who was quite uncommunicative and schizoid, who, whenever he became 
annoyed—and he was very irritable—would go completely silent and withdraw from the 
place. Matías experienced him as distant and absent. He had never received any advice from 
him, never had any physical contact with him, nor had they ever played any sport or game 
together. In his account, the two older brothers barely  gured. My impression was that mother 
and son formed nearly a single being, around which orbited a weak and indistinct father.
For Welldon,
the opportunity that maternity offers to have complete control of a situation creates the right 
pre-conditions for certain women, who have suffered harmful or traumatic experiences, to 
exploit and abuse their children. This is how the mothers of maltreated children, transsexuals 
and—especially—sexually perverted men are constituted (1993, p. 91).

76
JUAN PABLO JIMÉNEZ
According to this author, mothers who display perverse tendencies towards their 
offspring do it during the child's  rst two years. Maternal perverse tendencies include 
non-recognition of the baby's gender, transgression of the limits imposed by the incest 
taboo, seduction and inappropriate overstimulation of the genitals. All of these tendencies 
are considerable obstacles for the small boy or girl's individuation and encourage the 
formation of highly ambivalent symbiotic object relations, because of the considerable 
humiliation and narcissistic injury they in ict on the child.
Krause suggests that patients use impossible combinations of affects, urges and 
terminal actions to protect and preserve their identity. These processes to repair and 
secure identity are obtained by sexualising the body image. Constructing the body image 
as a building block in the formation of identity is built into object relations. According 
to social referencing theory (Emde, 1989), the baby perceives the object world, and 
with it also his own body, according to the affect displayed by signi cant others. If, 
for example, the genital region elicits disgust in the adult carer, then the handling and 
daily overstimulation of this region will be accompanied and marked by the affect 
'disgust'. Krause's research has demonstrated that such expressive phenomena are 
mostly uncontrollable, unconscious and quite frequent. In such conditions, Pavlovian 
conditioning processes are set in motion, and this means that the stimulation of this region 
of the body image will fall under the domination of propositional structures—in this case, 
disgust. Instinctual excitation will thus be overmodulated by the object relation. From a 
subjective point of view, a situation like this leads to the very protected genital region's 
being 'uncoupled' from the body scheme. As many authors have indicated, the fetish 
is a pathological type of transitional object whose function is to cover over this 'hole' 
(Greenacre, 1969; Morgenthaler, 1984). The ensuing anxiety at the loss of the genitals 
(castration anxiety) then falls on a body image already exhibiting a sensory vacuum in 
this zone.
Ogden (1996) af rms that it is now widely accepted that the analysis of perversion 
is not so much a matter of decoding and interpreting fantasies, anxiety or unconscious 
defences which are acted out and represented in perverse sexual activity as, to a far 
greater degree, a matter of understanding and interpreting the transference phenomena. 
This idea is consistent with those presented above, for such instances of pathological 
learning where sexuality is uncoupled from its 'natural' goals, leading to impossible 
combinations, are inscribed in implicit non-declarative memory and thus in a non-
symbolic level. Access to such body-based schemes is only partially possible, precisely 
through therapeutic work centred on the non-verbal aspects of the bond, that is, through 
understanding and analysing countertransference (Fonagy, 1999; Leuzinger-Bohleber 
and Pfeifer, 2002). The perverse object-world, where the parental couple and, with it, 
sexuality are felt to be empty, non-generative and misleading, must then be taken as an 
epi-phenomenon whose earliest origin must be sought in the violent subversion—induced 
by pathological mothers—of sexual impulses that are thus blocked in their 'natural' 
terminal action and placed in the service of other urges.
Naturally, it is worth enquiring whether Krause's psychogenetic hypothesis about 
the 'impossible combination' of affect and sexuality induced by a pathological mother, 
suf ciently accounts for the origin and perpetuation of the pervert's internal world. 
This question is related to the present controversy in psychoanalysis around the relation 

77
A PSYCHOANALYTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF PERVERSION
between environment and structure, in other words, about the scope and limits of a 
developmental understanding of personality and psychological disorders. Fonagy states 
the central point of the discussion as follows:
The relationship of actual experience and its representation is greatly complicated by the 
fact that comparable caregiver behaviour may be experienced and encoded differently by 
different infants. While contextual factors, for example, small differences between the 
caregiver's behaviour towards two siblings (non-shared environment), may account for some 
of these effects, distortions in the child's perception due to internal states of fantasies, affects, 
and con icts are also likely to play a part (2001, pp. 185-6, my italics).
Discussion: Phenomenology and theoretical pluralism in psychoanalysis
The reader may have found it striking that, in attempting to explain the clinical 
phenomenology of perversion, I should have appealed to a broad range of authors 
belonging to rather different theoretical currents in psychoanalysis. Also, that, in proposing 
a psychogenetic hypothesis for perversion, I should have relied on ideas that proceed from 
empirical research on affect communication and the mother-child relation. Such research 
introduces concepts that are not psychoanalytical in their origins and are instead borrowed 
from ethology, cognitive science and learning theory. A possible objection might then be 
that there are different degrees of non-uniformity in the approaches I have used, and thus 
that my own work will lack consistency and internal validity. Without becoming involved 
with the thorny problems the crisis around consensus and the acceptance of pluralism 
represent for contemporary psychoanalysis, I  nd support in those who af rm that the 
a priori condition of possibility for any theory in psychoanalysis and for any dialogue 
between psychoanalysts is that a reality transcending the observer exists, even when it 
may be apprehended only in a partial and fragmentary way (Hanly, 1990; Strenger, 1991; 
Cavell, 1993). On the other hand, to assume an intersubjective point of view does not in 
any case eliminate the concept of an objective world with which we are in contact and 
regarding which we strive to be more or less objective. As Cavell af rms, 'both a real, 
shared, external world and the concept of such a world are indispensable to propositional 
thought, and to the capacity to know one's own thoughts as thoughts, as a subjective 
perspective of the world' (1998, p. 449). An idea like this opens the door to pluralism, 
that is, to a middle way between a situation of total non-uniformity among theories and 
theoretical monism that could only be upheld from an authoritarian posture.
In this sense, I base my argument on the fact that when we speak of perversion and 
perverse structure we are referring to phenomena that, in principle, can be observed 
and described by another observer, independently of his theoretical stance. A different 
matter is what theory is invoked as explanation. By reading the material referred to 
above, especially certain telling fragments I quoted, I feel con dent that the authors 
share implicitly the clinical description I have made explicit. As I suggested at the 
beginning of this paper, one of the problems at the root of the contemporary confusion 
in the dialogue among psychoanalysts appears to reside in the relative lack of a discipline 
making it possible to lay out clinical phenomena in a way that would make discussion 
possible. Too quickly do we ascend to the terrain of metapsychological speculation, 

78
JUAN PABLO JIMÉNEZ
where the more abstract theories obscure the freshness of the emerging phenomena 
and open the way to ideological and group dynamics and other remote phenomena. Of 
course, an objectively oriented psycho-pathological description, in the style of classical 
psychiatry, does not do justice to the psychoanalytical point of view. My belief is that 
phenomenology, by incorporating the intersubjective5 nature of clinical phenomena, 
brings to bear the requisite discipline to describe them in statu nascendi. I have af rmed 
that metapsychology is the translation into theory of what in the analyst's mind appears 
immediately and experientially when immersed in the relation with his patient. This 
immediate apprehension happens for the most part outside the analyst's conscious 
awareness, and this ultimately translates into writing that fails to describe explicitly how 
the psycho-pathological structures impact on the analyst's mind. But phenomenology 
teaches us to make explicit the clinical situation's implicit aspects. In following the 
method of phenomenological introspection, I believe I have shown that it is possible to 
rede ne clinically, as Amati-Mehler (1995) requested, the concept of perversion, without 
abandoning the psychoanalytical method.
Translations of summary
Eine psychoanalytische Phänomenologie der Perversion. Im Anschluß an die These, daß die heutige 
psychoanalytische Forschung grundsätzlich auch die Untersuchung der mentalen Prozesse berücksichtigen 
sollte, die sich in der Analysesitzung im Analytiker vollziehen, beschreibt der Autor den intersubjektiven 
Charakter der analytischen Beziehung. Von außen betrachtet, weist diese zwei Pole auf: einen symmetrischen 
strukturellen Pol, an dem Analytiker und Patient ein und dieselbe Welt sowie ein und denselben Blick auf 
die Realität teilen, und einen funktionalen asymmetrischen Pol, der die Zuschreibung der jeweiligen Rollen 
de niert. In der Analyse eines perversen Patienten entwickelt die Symmetrie-Asymmetrie-Polarität sehr 
spezi sche Charakteristika. In der Perspektive der Subjektivität des Analytikers stellt sich die Perversion in 
dessen Gedanken als heimliche und unerwartete Verletzung der basalen Übereinkunft dar, die intersubjektive 
Begegnungen ermöglicht und strukturiert. Dies kann soweit gehen, dass aristotelische Logikregeln verändert 
werden. Wenn der Analytiker mit der psychischen Realität eines perversen Patienten in Kontakt kommt, 
nimmt in seinem Innern eine Welt Gestalt an. Diese Welt ist durch eine irreführende Erotisierung gefärbt, 
die früher oder später Züge der Gewalt annehmen wird. Als „falsche" Realität schwebt der perverse Nukleus 
sozusagen im Raum und bleibt der Empathie des Analytikers unzugänglich. Der Analytiker kann ihn nur von 
der „Peripherie" der psychischen Realität des Patienten aus erreichen, indem er indirekt versucht, diesen zu 
seinen intersubjektiven Wurzeln zurückzuführen. Der Autor untersucht und erklärt dieses intersubjektive 
Phänomen im Rahmen von metapsychologischen Konzepten und empiriegestützten Theorien. Abschließend 
werden Überlegungen zur Psychogenese der Perversion formuliert.
Una fenomenología psicoanalítica de la perversión. Después de plantear que las tareas actuales de la 
investigación psicoanalítica pasan por la exploración de los procesos mentales del analista trabajando con el

afuera, la relación analítica muestra un polo simétrico, en el que analista y paciente comparten un mismo 
mundo y un mismo acercamiento a la realidad, y un polo funcional, asimétrico, que de ne la asignación 
de los roles respectivos. La polaridad simetría-asimetría cobra en el análisis de un perverso características 
peculiares. A través del análisis de un paciente perverso las polaridades simétrias y asimétricas adquieren 
ciertas características muy especiales. Vista desde la perspectiva de la subjetividad del analista la perversión 
5Assuming that in metapsychology one can differentiate the level of clinical theory from the properly 
metapsychological one (Klein, 1970), one can say schematically that, at the clinical level, the psycho-dynamic is 
'con gured' in the analyst's mind and 'organises' the patient's material, with this making possible the conjoined 
understanding that, via interpretation and insight, contributes to therapeutic change. Metapsychology as a 
hypothesis, by contrast, has a function of explaining. It is at this latter level that a developmental psychopathology—
compatible with the results of modern research on the mother-child relation—can complement and eventually 
correct metapsychological explanations.

A PSYCHOANALYTICAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF PERVERSION
aparece como una transgresión subrepticia e inesperada contra el acuerdo básico que hace posible y estructura 
el encuentro intersubjetivo, llegando hasta la trasgresión de las reglas de la lógica aristotélica. Al entrar en 
contacto con la realidad psíquica del perverso, en la mente del analista se con gura un mundo cuya atmósfera 
se tiñe engañosamente de una erotización que tarde o temprano cobra cualidades de violencia. El núcleo 
perverso queda  otando como una falsa realidad, como una experiencia inaccesible a la empatía del analista. 
La única manera de alcanzarlo es desde la 'periferia' de la realidad psíquica del paciente, indirectamente, 
tratando de reconducirlo hasta sus raíces intersubjetivas. En un segundo momento, se intenta explicar este 
fenómeno intersubjetivo desde la teoría metapsicológica y desde teorías basadas en la investigación empírica. 
Por último, el autor plantea algunas ideas sobre la psicogénesis de la perversión.
Une phénoménologie psychanalytique de la perversion. Après avoir af rmé que les tâches actuelles de 
la recherche psychanalytique devraient fondamentalement comporter l'exploration des processus mentaux 
de l'analyste en séance avec le patient, l'auteur décrit la relation analytique comme une relation de nature 
intersubjective. Vue de l'extérieur, la relation analytique apparaît comme ayant deux pôles : un pôle symétrique 
structural, où analyste et patient partagent un monde singulier et une approche singulière de la réalité, et un pôle 
asymétrique fonctionnel, qui dé nit l'assignation à leurs rôles respectifs. Dans l'analyse d'un patient pervers, 
les polarités symétrique - asymétrique acquièrent certaines caractéristiques très particulières. Vue à partir de 
la perspective de la subjectivité de l'analyste, la perversion apparaît dans l'esprit de l'analyste comme une 
transgression clandestine et inattendue de l'accord de base qui facilite et structure les rencontres intersubjectives. 
Ceci peut aller suf samment loin pour altérer les règles aristotéliciennes de la logique. Lorsqu'il entre en contact 
avec la réalité psychique d'un patient pervers, l'esprit de l'analyste assiste à la mise en forme de tout un monde. 
Ce monde est trompeusement coloré par une érotisation qui tôt ou tard va acquérir des caractéristiques de 
violence. Comme une fausse réalité, le noyau pervers reste suspendu dans l'ambiance comme une expérience 
inaccessible à l'empathie de l'analyste. Le seul moyen pour l'analyste d'y accéder est de procéder à partir de 
la « périphérie » de la réalité psychique du patient, en essayant de façon indirecte de le conduire en arrière, à 
ses racines intersubjectives. Le propos de l'auteur est d'expliciter ce phénomène intersubjectif dans les termes 
de la théorie métapsychologique et des théories basées sur la recherche empirique. Finalement, l'auteur avance 
quelques idées sur la psychogenèse de la perversion.
Una fenomenologia psicoanalitica della perversione. Dopo aver affermato che i compiti attuali della 
ricerca psicoanalitica dovrebbero includere, fondamentalmente, l'esplorazione dei processi mentali dello 
psicoanalista durante le sedute con il paziente, l'autore descrive il rapporto analitico come relazione 
intersoggettiva. Da un'ottica esterna, il rapporto psicoanalitico mostra di avere due poli: uno strutturale 
simmetrico in cui l'analista e il paziente condividono un unico mondo e un unico approccio alla realtà, e 
uno funzionale asimmetrico che de nisce l'assegnazione dei rispettivi ruoli. Nell'analisi di un paziente 
perverso, le polarità simmetrica-asimmetrica acquistano alcune caratteristiche molto particolari. Vista dalla 
prospettiva della soggettività dell'analista, la perversione appare alla mente di questi come una trasgressione 
surrettizia e inaspettata dal patto fondamentale che facilita e struttura gli incontri intersoggettivi, e che 
può giungere ad alterare le regole della logica aristotelica. Quando lo psicoanalista entra in contatto con la 
realtà psichica di un paziente perverso, nella sua mente prende forma un mondo la cui atmosfera si tinge 
in modo ingannevole di un'erotizzazione che, prima o poi, assumerà caratteristiche di violenza. Il nucleo 
perverso, in quanto falsa realtà, resta a ondeggiare a mezz'aria come esperienza inaccessibile all'empatia 
dell'analista. L'unica via attraverso la quale questi può raggiungerlo è dalla "periferia" della realtà psichica 
del paziente, indirettamente, cercando di riportarlo alle sue radici intersoggettive. A questo punto l'autore 
intende spiegare questo fenomeno intersoggettivo secondo teorie basate sulla ricerca metapsicologica ed 
empirica, concludendo in ne con delle considerazioni sulla psicogenesi della perversione.
