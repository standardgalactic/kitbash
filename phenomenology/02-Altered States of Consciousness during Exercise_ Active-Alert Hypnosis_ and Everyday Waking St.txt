ABSTRACT
This retrospective study was a nonrandomized comparison of 
exercisers' (runners and participants of a spinning class) states of 
consciousness with subjects of active-alert hypnosis (AAH) and 
students in a class (control). Three hundred and seventy-five parti­
cipants completed the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory 
(PCI). Runners, spinners, and participants of AAH scored higher on 
the altered experience and altered state of awareness dimensions of 
the PCI than the control group. Runners scored higher than parti­
cipants of AAH and the control condition on the rationality dimen­
sion, and spinners scored higher than participants in the AAH 
condition. The AAH group scored lowest on the self-awareness 
dimension. On the volitional control dimension, the spinning and 
control groups scored significantly higher than the runner and 
AAH groups. The results suggest that exercise may lead to states 
of consciousness similar to AAH and thus increase responsiveness 
to a coach's training suggestions.

Introduction
People who exercise often report experiencing changes in consciousness, especially 
when they perform better than expected (Chavez, 2008). People engaged in physical 
activity often describe experiencing focused attention, a feeling of increased control, 
a reduced sense of anxiety, and moving without conscious effort (Ravizza, 1977). These 
reports of alterations in consciousness are very similar to the experiences described 
during active-alert hypnosis (AAH; Bányai, 1987). During AAH, the individual rides 
a bicycle ergometer while receiving suggestions of freshness and increased activity. 
This feature makes AAH a valuable tool in sport psychology (Bányai, 2018). Although 
exercise and AAH seem to be similar in that both may induce alterations in con­
sciousness, to our knowledge they have not been directly compared in this sense. The 
aim of this study is to examine the subjective experiences (related to the phenomen­
ology of consciousness) during solitary running and group spinning exercise and 
compare them with experiences during AAH and everyday waking state.

Until recently, there had been few research projects on altered states of consciousness 
(ASC) in the context of sport and exercise, apart from the study of "flow" or "the zone" 
experience described by many athletes (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Mindfulness-based med­
itation techniques are closely related to the description of flow (Gardner & Moore, 2004; 
Kaufman et al., 2009; Kee & John Wang, 2008; Pérez & Crobu, 2018), as well as hypnosis 
(Hernández Mendo et al., 2017), and both have been used successfully to enhance sport 
performance (Kaufman et al., 2009; De Petrillo et al., 2009; Wolanin & Schwanhausser, 
2010) or assist injury rehabilitation (Palmi et al., 2018). According to the transient hypo­
frontality theory of consciousness, similarities between exercise and hypnosis can be 
explained by overlapping changes in brain activity (Dietrich, 2006). However, to our 
knowledge, there has been no systematic research on ASC that occurs spontaneously in 
response to exercise. More specifically, there is no empirical evidence whether a single bout 
of exercise, like running or spinning, can be associated with ASC.
We hypothesize that individuals engaged in exercise (running and spinning), contrasted 
to those in everyday waking state, are more likely to experience ASC. Our other hypothesis 
is that participants engaged in exercise as well as those undergoing AAH would experience 
ASC, but these would differ in some aspects. The aim of the present study was to determine 
whether there are subjective changes in consciousness during exercise similar to those 
experienced during AAH and different from a conscious awake state, such as paying 
attention during a lecture.
Materials and Methods
The study protocol was approved by our university's institutional ethical board. Participants 
were invited through e-mail and word of mouth to join the study on a voluntary basis; they 
were not offered compensation. Data for this study were collected by and retrieved from the 
database of the university's Hypnosis Lab.
Participants
Four groups of participants (self-reported to be mentally and physically healthy) totaling 
375 volunteers completed the Hungarian version of the Phenomenology of Consciousness 
Inventory (PCI; Józsa et al., 2019) during 2018 and 2019. The four groups were (1) solitary 
runners (n = 54); (2) spinners - participants of spinning class (n = 36); (3) subjects 
undergoing active-alert hypnosis (n = 26); ad (4) awake control participants (n = 259). 
Exclusion criteria in the study for participants were self-reported use of psychiatric drugs 
and/or self-reported diagnosis of mental and physical illness. A general description of 
participants can be found in Table 1.

Group 1 (54 solitary runners) ran outdoors, except for 2 participants who ran indoors on 
a treadmill. Most Group 1 participants (31 people - 57,4%) ran 3 to 4 times a week; 1 ran less 
than once a week, and 1 person ran twice a day. Participants were invited to complete the 
questionnaire online, thinking back to a particularly memorable running experience, without 
any specific time frame for filling out the questionnaire. The data has not been reported before.
Group 2 (36 spinners - participants of spinning class) attended two separate but identical 
spinning classes at two urban fitness centers. Instructors of both classes have studied under the 
same master trainer, had similar techniques, and used similar music. Participants were 
approached through the trainers and asked to complete the questionnaire online thinking 
back to a particularly memorable spinning experience. Participants were invited to complete 
the questionnaire online, thinking back to a particularly memorable spinning experience, 
without any specific time frame for filling out the questionnaire. The data have not been 
reported before.
Group 3 (26 individual AAH participants) were selected from the Hypnosis Laboratory 
database, and their hypnotizability was assessed during a traditional group hypnosis session. 
The group hypnosis followed the protocol of the standardized Harvard Group Scale of 
Hypnotic Susceptibility: Form A (HGSHS:A; Költő et al., 2015; Shor & Orne, 1963) and 
included all 12 items. The range of hypnotizability scores were 6 to 11 (M = |8|, SD = 1.48). 
These participants were then invited to the AAH study series, where they participated in 
individual AAH sessions. Results for the AAH series have been reported elsewhere: (E. 
Kasos et al., 2018; K. Kasos et al., 2018; Kasos et al., 2020).
All hypnosis sessions followed the standardized protocol of laboratory AAH (Bányai 
& Hilgard, 1976) and were conducted by certified clinical hypnotherapists who com­
pleted the EAPTI (European Accredited Psychotherapy Training Institute) certified 
training of the country's prominent hypnosis association and follow their ethical 
guidelines regarding psychotherapy and hypnotherapy. Participants filled out the 
paper-pencil form of the PCI immediately after the hypnosis session with regard to 
their experiences during hypnosis. Phenomenological results, including the PCI for 
this group were reported in E. Kasos et al. (2020).
Group 4 (259 awake control participants) consisted of college or university students 
who completed the paper-pencil form of the PCI immediately after classes in arts or 
natural sciences, with regard to their experiences during class. Each class comprised at 
least 10 participants. Participants from psychology classes were not included to keep 
the classes' subject matter neutral to the topic of this study. Participants were 
approached as a group before the end of the class with the instructors' permission 
and filling out the PCI was voluntary.
Instruments
Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory
The Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI) is a retrospective 53-item, self- 
report test that measures subjective experiences in relation to alterations in consciousness 
along 12 major and 14 minor dimensions (Pekala, 1991). It can be completed regarding any 
event that may induce ASC, such as hypnosis, psychoactive substances, music, etc. (Józsa 
et al., 2019), therefore it is a suitable method to compare the subjective experiences related 
to ASCs occurring in various contexts. We used the validated Hungarian version of the PCI 
302
E. KASOS ET AL.

(Józsa et al., 2019). Participants received identical instructions that followed the original 
version (Pekala, 1991) and completed the questionnaire immediately following an experi­
ence (Group 3: AAH and Group 4: classroom) or thinking back to a particularly memorable 
event or experience (Group 1: solitary runners and Group 2: spinners). Test items consist of 
binary statements, and participants rate on a 7-point Likert scale how much the statement 
describes their experience (i.e.: "I felt very, very sad." versus "I felt no feelings of sadness 
whatsoever"). For dimensions of the questionnaire, see Appendix I. The PCI contains 
a reliability measure that can be calculated based on the comparison of answers given to 
similarly worded items. Its value varies between 0 and 6, and according to the suggestion of 
Pekala (1991) data of participants who scored above 2 should be excluded from the analysis. 
In our data set, none of the participants scored above the suggested threshold.
The PCI has adequate construct and discriminant validity for the assessment of sub­
jective states associated with hypnosis (Pekala, 1991). Out of the 26 dimensions of the PCI, 
four dimensions are especially relevant to altered states of consciousness. These are altered 
experience, altered state of awareness, rationality, and self-awareness (Farthing, 2008; Varga 
et al., 2014). Altered experience consists of four subdimensions and expresses changes in 
body image, time sense, perception and meaning. The study also includes results for the 
dimension volitional control for two reasons. First, there is ample evidence that under 
hypnosis, sense of volitional control is changing, especially among high hypnotizable 
subjects (Chavez, 2008; E. Kasos et al., 2020; Pekala, 1991). Second, its examination across 
the four groups may help understanding whether exercisers' sense of volitional control 
changes during exercise the same way it does in hypnosis. Cronbach's alpha for the 
dimension volitional control is somewhat lower than the desirable threshold of 70, but it 
is similar to the results in the Hungarian validation study (Józsa et al., 2019) (Table 2).
Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale Form C
Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, Form C (SHSS:C): contains 12 progressively more 
difficult items, including cognitive suggestions such as hallucination and age regression 
(Weitzenhoffer & Hilgard, 1962). Test-retest reliability of the SHSS:C has been shown to be 
rs = .66, 95% (.47-.86; Kekecs et al., 2021).
Procedure
Participants engaged in physical activity (running and spinning) completed an online 
questionnaire thinking back to a particularly memorable exercise. This method was chosen 
because one cannot assume that spontaneous ASC occurs each time a person exercises, and

so we relied instead on our instructions that participants retrospectively recall a particularly 
"intense and in some way defining" occasion as the basis for their subsequent responses. 
Participants of the AAH and control groups completed the test in a paper-and-pencil 
format immediately after their experiences.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were carried out with SPSS statistical software (Version 24). To examine the 
difference in alteration of consciousness among the four groups (runners, spinners, AAH, 
and waking state control), Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed for the five identified scales 
of the PCI (altered state of awareness, altered experience, rationality, self-awareness, voli­
tional control). The Kruskal-Wallis test is the nonparametric equivalent of a one-way 
ANOVA and the preferred method for analyzing data that are derived from Likert-scale 
type questionnaires such as the PCI (Dodge, 2008). Pairwise differences were tested with 
subsequent nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests. To prevent the accumulation of Type 
I errors, p values of the Mann-Whitney tests were adjusted with Bonferroni correction. 
Statistical significance was defined as p < .05.
Results
Altered Experience
A significant difference was observed across the groups on the altered experience dimension 
of the PCI: χ2(3) = 57.42, p < .001. Runners' scores on this dimension were significantly 
higher than participants' in the control condition: Z = −6.31, p < .001. The effect was strong 
(Cohen's r = .32). Spinners scored significantly higher than participants in the control 
condition: Z = −4.27, p < .001, with a medium-sized effect (Cohen's r = .22). Participants 
undergoing AAH scored higher than participants in the control condition: Z = −3.50, 
p < .001, with a medium sized effect (Cohen's r = .18). There were no other statistically 
significant differences.
Altered State of Awareness
A significant difference was found between altered state of awareness across the four groups: 
χ2(3) = 111.76, p < .001. Runners gave higher scores on this dimension than participants in 
the control group: Z = −6.31, p < .001, with a strong effect (Cohen's r= .32). Spinners 
reported higher scores than participants in the control group: Z = −5.97, p < .001, the effect 
was strong (Cohen's r = −.30). Participants in AAH scored higher than participants in the 
control group: Z = −6.80, p < .001, with a strong effect (Cohen's r = −.35). There were no 
other statistically significant differences.
Rationality
A significant difference was found across the groups in rationality scores: χ2(3) = 21.33.37, 
p < .001. Runners reported higher scores than participants in the AAH group: Z = −3.59, 
p < .001, with a medium-sized effect (Cohen's r = .18). Runners reported higher scores than 
304
E. KASOS ET AL.

participants in the control group: Z = −3.68, p < .001, the effect was medium (Cohen's 
r = .19). Spinners reported higher scores than participants in the AAH group Z = −2.65, 
p < .048, with a small-to-medium effect (Cohen's r = .13). There were no other statistically 
significant differences.
Self-Awareness
A significant difference in self-awareness scores was found across the groups: χ2(3) = 20.76, 
p < .001. Participants in the exercise groups scored higher than those in the control and 
active-alert condition. Post hoc comparisons revealed that all three groups (running, 
spinning, and waking control) scored significantly higher than the active-alert group, 
with strong effect: Z = −3.24, p < .001 Cohen's r = .36; Z = −2.90, p < .004, Cohen's 
r = .37; Z = −4.60, p < .001, Cohen's r = −.23, respectively. There were no other statistically 
significant differences.
Volitional Control
A significant difference was found in volitional control scores across the groups: χ2 
(3) = 30.64, p < .001. Spinners reported higher volitional control than participants in the 
AAH condition Z = −2.98, p = .024, with a medium-sized effect (Cohen's r = .15). Control 
participants scored higher than participants in the AAH condition: Z = −4.13, p < .001, with 
a medium effect (Cohen's r = .21). The running group did not differ significantly from the 
AAH group, and the other differences were not statistically significant either.
Discussion
Results of the current work demonstrate that young adult participants' retrospective recall 
of earlier exercise training experiences reflected an altered state of consciousness. As 
measured by dimensions of the PCI, these altered experiences were comparable to the 
experiences reported by highly hypnotizable subjects who had undergone AAH. Overall, 
one might presume from these findings that important mental changes occur during 
exercise. It seems that participants of running and spinning exercise at least sometimes 
experience altered states of consciousness that mirror that of hypnosis participants', 
including changes in perception, body image, time sense, meaning, and altered states of 
awareness.
The transient hypofrontality theory of consciousness (Dietrich, 2006) may explain the 
similarities between sport and hypnosis. This model states that during exercise certain areas 
of the brain are not essential to performing the task. In these areas, such as the prefrontal 
cortex, a decrease of activity can be observed, because processing in the brain is competitive 
and resources are limited. This leads to a shift in the brain's activity from the anterior to the 
posterior regions, which can be observed during meditation and hypnosis too (Bányai, 
2008). The state of frontal hypofunction can explain the influences of sport on emotion and 
cognition (Dietrich, 2006).
The altered experience dimension of the PCI resulted in significant differences between 
the participants in the awake control condition and those in the running, spinning, and 
active-alert hypnosis conditions. According to these results, participants in all three

"physically active" conditions reported higher scores for altered state than did those in the 
awake control condition. This finding underlines the differences in subjective experiences 
between waking state and various forms of physical activities (Farthing, 2008), also 
supporting the idea that there are different ways to induce/get into an altered state of 
consciousness.
Altered state of awareness also significantly differed for participants in all three 
active condition groups (running, spinning, and AAH) compared to participants in the 
waking-state control group. Meanwhile, no significant differences in altered state of 
awareness were detected between the various active conditions. Participants in the 
exercise groups rated the change of their state of awareness similarly to that experi­
enced by participants during hypnosis. Meanwhile, participants in the everyday waking 
state control condition reported significantly lower alteration in their awareness than 
the other three groups. This finding gives further support to the hypothesis that 
changes in consciousness during exercise can be similar to those experienced by 
high hypnotizable subjects during hypnosis (Bányai et al., 1993).
The rationality dimension of the PCI represents the experience of clear thinking. In 
that dimension, runners had significantly higher scores than participants in the AAH 
group. Spinners did not report rationality scores that differed from participants in the 
control condition, while runners scored significantly higher. This divergence of experi­
ence between the two types of physical activities in contrast with the awake condition may 
suggest that not all physical exercises result in the same alterations in consciousness. The 
difference might be attributed to the fact that participants in both spinning and the awake 
control conditions were grouped, while running was a solitary activity. Solitary runners 
may have a harder time relinquishing rationality than spinners engaged in a group 
situation (Varga et al., 2014). Indeed, many people who regularly run associate (solitary) 
running activity with "mind cleaning," and empirical evidence also support a link between 
running and cognitive clarity (Lambourne & Tomporowski, 2010). An associated poten­
tial explanation might be that while runners who run outside need to constantly monitor 
their environment and adapt to it (e.g., avoiding barriers), those who ride a stationary 
spinning bicycle or attend a frontal-lead classroom lecture, may find it easier to let their 
minds wander.
On the self-awareness dimension of the PCI, participants in AAH scored significantly 
lower than the other three groups. During spinning, running, or even in a class, participants 
tend not to surrender themselves to the same extent, and, as a result, they seem to stay more 
aware of themselves than during hypnosis.
Volitional control was significantly lower for participants in AAH than for those in the 
spinning and the waking control condition. This result implies that the degree of perceived 
control is lowest among participants in hypnosis (an expected natural aspect of hypnosis; 
Kihlstrom, 2008). One of the hallmarks of the hypnotic phenomena is that during hypnosis 
the sense of agency changes (Költő & Polito, 2017), and monitoring of intentionality is 
reduced (Dienes & Perner, 2007). It is evident from our results that during spinning self- 
monitoring and agency do not change significantly and remain similar to a normal waking 
state. During hypnosis, the subject - at least partially - allows the hypnotist to take the lead, 
follows the hypnotist's suggestions (Barušs, 2003; Nash, 1991; Nash & Barnier, 2008; Varga 
et al., 2013), and several of the hypnotic suggestions are focused on the directionality of 
attention. The results of the running group were similar to the AAH group. This finding

may suggest that when one exercises with others, they have to pay attention to the instructor 
or other people, therefore their attention is directed outwards. In contrast, during solitary 
running, attention is more likely directed inward, just as during AAH. This may indicate 
that attention can be directed as the circumstances require it, even during ASC.
Limitations
The current work has some limitations that should be considered in interpreting these 
results. Participants were not randomly assigned to their group and this may give way to 
some bias (Költő et al., 2015). Also all participants filled out the questionnaires after the 
experience. Athletes recalled running and spinning in a retrospective fashion, while subjects 
in AAH and in the waking control condition completed the PCI immediately after the 
event. Retrospective recall, while used successfully before in data collection (Roussel & 
Bachelor, 2001) may be subject to memory distortion, perhaps limiting the accuracy/ 
generalizability of our findings.
Further, the hypnotizability of participants in our running and spinning conditions was 
not assessed, though it might have been important to determine these participants' ability to 
enter an altered state of consciousness through exercise. Their hypnotizability may have 
impacted their presumed sensitivity to athletic-training suggestions.
These altogether imply that future research should employ a more methodologically 
robust data collection method, take participant measures during and after exercise, and 
assess the hypnotizability and motivation of all participants.
In spite of these limitations, this investigation suggests that changes in consciousness can 
occur during exercise. These altered experiences are, to some extent, similar to those 
occurring during active-alert hypnosis, while they are remarkably different from experi­
ences recalled by individuals who participate in an everyday awake task. These findings 
provide a basis for further research that addresses whether exercise can be a path to greater 
suggestibility and enhanced performance. Based on our findings, we also suggest the 
consideration of more conscious employment of suggestive techniques in sport.

Verändertes Bewusstsein während Training, Aktiv-Wach Hypnose und im Alltags 
Wachzustand

Zusammenfassung: Diese retrospektive Untersuchung war ein nicht randomisierter Vergleich des 
Bewusstseinszustands Trainierender (Läufer und Teilnehmer eines Spinning-Kurses) mit 
Versuchspersonen in Aktiv-Wach Hypnose (AAH) und Studierenden in einer Klasse 
(Kontrollgruppe). 375 Teilnehmer absolvierten das Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory 
(PCI). Läufer, Spinning Teilnehmer und die AAH-Teilnehmer erzielten höhere Werte bei den 
Dimensionen altered experience (veränderte Erfahrung) und altered state of awareness (veränderte 
Wahrnehmung) beim PCI, verglichen mit der Kontrollgruppe. Die Läufer zeigten auf der Dimension 
rationality (Ratioalität) höhere Werte als die Teilnehmer der AAH Gruppe und die Kontrollgruppe, 
die Teilnehmer der Spinning Gruppe hatten höhere Werte als diejenigen der AAH Gruppe. Die AAH 
Gruppe hatte die niedrigsten Werte in self-awareness (Selbstwahrnehmung). In der Kategorie voli­
tional control (Willenskontrolle) erreichten die Spinning Gruppe und die Kontrollgruppe signifikant 
höhere Werte als die Läufer und die AAH Teilnehmer. Die Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass Training zu 
ähnlichem Bewusstseinszustand führen kann wie AAH und so die Empfänglichkeit für die 
Anweisungen des Trainers zu steigern vermag.

Résumé: Cette étude rétrospective fait une comparaison non randomisée des états de conscience des 
pratiquants (coureurs et participants d'un cours de spinning) avec des sujets en hypnose d'alerte 
active (AAH) et des élèves d'une classe (contrôle). Trois cent soixante-quinze participants ont rempli 
l'inventaire de la phénoménologie de la conscience (PCI). Les coureurs, les spinners et les participants 
à l'AAH ont obtenu des scores plus élevés sur les dimensions de l'expérience altérée et de l'état de 
conscience altéré du PCI que le groupe témoin. Les coureurs ont obtenu des scores plus élevés que les 
participants de l'AAH et de la condition de contrôle sur la dimension de la rationalité, et les spinners 
ont obtenu des scores plus élevés que les participants de la condition AAH. Le groupe AAH a obtenu 
le score le plus bas sur la dimension de la conscience de soi. Sur la dimension du contrôle volontaire, 
les groupes de spinning et de contrôle ont obtenu des scores significativement plus élevés que les 
groupes de coureurs et d'AAH. Les résultats suggèrent que l'exercice peut conduire à des états de 
conscience similaires à l'AAH et ainsi augmenter la réactivité aux suggestions d'entraînement d'un 
coach.

Resumen: Este estudio retrospectivo fue una comparación no aleatoria de los estados de conciencia 
de deportistas (corredores y participantes de una clase de spinning) con sujetos en hipnosis alerta 
activa (HAA) y estudiantes en una clase (control). Trescientos setenta y cinco participantes 
completaron el Inventario de Fenomenología de la Conciencia (PCI). Los Corredores, giradores 
y participantes de HAA puntuaron más alto en las dimensiones de experiencia alterada y estado

alterado de conciencia del PCI que el grupo de control. Los corredores puntuaron más alto que los 
participantes de HAA y el grupo control en la dimensión de racionalidad, y los del grupo de 
spinning puntuaron más alto que los participantes de la condición HAA. El grupo HAA obtuvo la 
menor puntuación en la dimensión de autoconciencia. En la dimensión de control volitivo, los 
grupos de spinning y control puntuaron significativamente más alto que los grupos de corredores 
y HAA. Los resultados sugieren que el ejercicio puede conducir a estados de conciencia similares 
a HAA y, por lo tanto, aumentar la capacidad de respuesta a las sugerencias de entrenamiento de 
un entrenador.
