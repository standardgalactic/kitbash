ABSTRACT
Risk studies have shown that many people rather than following rational 
means of managing risk refer to non-rational (hope, faith) and in-between 
rationales (trust, intuition), which are not irrational but reasonable and 
based on subjective experiences, which are difficult to overcome by the 
communication of mere expert knowledge. We suggest that the problem 
of analyzing subjective risk management can be itemized as a result of 
the tension between subjective and objectified forms of certitudes. To 
clarify this distinction, the article turns to the New Phenomenology of 
Hermann Schmitz for outlining the different epistemological foundations 
of rational, non-rational and in-between rationales. We then develop a 
model of three different forms of knowledge that are involved in sub­
jective risk management and elaborate the basic neo-phenomenological 
distinction of subjective and objective facts by differentiating the latter 
ones into rational and non-rational ones. We conclude with considering 
consequences of these epistemological challenges for risk 
communication.
1. Introduction
Interdisciplinary risk studies aim to improve social management and individual responses to 
risk. Issues such as pregnant women smoking or drinking, people not protecting their houses 
despite of repeating flooding, migrants engaging with people smugglers in high-risk journeys 
or people rejecting vaccination during the coronavirus crisis are all issues, which result in pre­
ventable loss, harm, or death. What is characteristic for such examples is that we always find 
a relatively wide and sometimes insuperable gap between the subjective and the objectified 
evaluation of risk situations. When explaining such behavior, risk studies has referred to the 
limits of the human brain for rational decision-making, and social factors influencing the expe­
riences of risk and uncertainty such as one's values and social positioning (Slovic, 2000b). The 
assumption of the superiority of expert knowledge over lay-people's emotional perceptions has 
been challenged by science and technology studies highlighting the reasonable rationales of 
lay people (Wynne, 1996a, 1996b) and research on practical reasoning (Horlick-Jones, 2005a, 
2005b) and individual engagement with risk (Zinn, 2008, 2016) which have highlighted a variety 
of reasonable ways to engage with risk and uncertainty such as trust, intuition, hope and faith. 
These observations are supported by neurological research that has shown that subjectively

sensed emotional and objectifying rational spheres of the brain always work together when 
processing information (Damasio, 1996). However, overcoming Descartes' view of the division 
between body and mind, comes with fundamental epistemological questions about people's 
knowledge and engagement with risk. To explore the epistemological differences of the ways 
how 'body and mind' work together when people engage with risk and uncertainty we turn to 
the ideal-typical distinction between 'rational', 'non-rational' (e.g. hope, faith) and 'in-between' 
(e.g. trust, intuition) rationales (Zinn, 2008, 2016) and draw on insights from New Phenomenology 
(Schmitz, 2019) to argue for the fundamental rooting of knowledge and facts in subjectively 
sensible1 certitudes. This has also ramifications for risk communication. We conclude that the 
shift of risk communication to deliberative, participative and procedural legitimacy to manage 
risk reasonably (Renn, 2008) is most successful when taking the subjective, embodied, and 
experience-based reality of risk into account.
In the following section we summarize central insights from risk studies and the different 
risk rationales introduced by Zinn (2008) to suggest that New Phenomenology could help to 
systematize epistemological variations of these kinds of knowledges. We then move on to 
section three with introducing the concept of a two-dimensional subjectivity, elaborated by 
New Phenomenology, to prepare the analytical ground for the epistemologically important 
distinction between 'subjective facts' and 'objective facts' (section four). The fifth step of argu­
mentation consists in two parts: firstly, we elaborate the model of subjective and objective facts 
by differentiating the latter ones into two ways of reflecting the respective life circumstances, 
namely empirical objectivations (rationality) and metaphysical objectivations (hope and faith). 
Secondly, we apply this distinction to the results of risk research and combine it with the model 
of risk rationales. Finally, we finish in section six with discussing what acting reasonably means 
in situations of uncertainty and the implications for risk communication.
2. Risk studies and new phenomenology
Typically, subjective risk perception and the objective knowledge about these risks often differ. 
For example, many people are concerned about relatively low risks such as being killed by an 
airplane disaster or nuclear power failure while underestimating comparatively high risks of 
activities such as smoking, drinking, cycling, riding a motor bike, lack of exercising, or unhealthy 
nutrition (Slovic, 2000b). More than 50 years of interdisciplinary risk research has proven the 
importance of best evidence and modelling for managing risky uncertainties while a growing 
body of research showed that subjective and social factors are crucial to understand how people 
perceive and make decisions about risk. Consequently, risk analysis focusses on the provision 
of best available evidence. The efforts to communicate risk knowledge in a way that best deci­
sions are fostered has shown that differences in values and interests are central to public risk 
conflicts and different perceptions and responses to risk (Renn, 2008). Approaches to risk com­
munication and risk governance therefore focused on deliberative approaches and public engage­
ment emphasizing the need for legitimacy in risky decision making (Rosa et al., 2014). While 
there is still a knowledge component involved, these approaches also showed that social factors 
such as the building of trust (Fischhoff, 1995; Renn & Levine, 1991) is at least as important to 
successful risk management as is communicating knowledge in an accessible way (Gigerenzer, 
2007). Furthermore, cognitive psychologists and behavioral economists have argued that people 
refer to 'short cuts', which relieve them from the burden of rationally exploring evidence in an 
increasingly complex life (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) and even experts develop an intuitive 
sense for risk through a cumulation of experiences (Klein, 1998) often referred to as 'gut feelings'. 
Additionally, the psychometric paradigm showed that people's risk perception is dominated by 
mainly two factors, the familiarity of a risk or the unknown risk factor and the expected awful­
ness of a risk or the dread factor with affect becoming increasingly acknowledged in their role

221
of influencing responses to risk (Slovic, 2010). At the same time, they brought back the question 
of how people acquire the knowledge for their decisions about risk. This became even more 
an issue since research showed that not only knowledge about risks and knowledge about the 
trustworthiness of others but anti-enlightenment approaches such as hope or faith play a role 
when people engage with unknown, uncertain, or highly complex but risky futures.
In order to take the sphere of subjective experience seriously and to systematize these different 
approaches to the world when engaging with risk, Zinn developed a three-dimensional scheme of 
rationales people utilize. He started with the modern orthodoxy of rational (evidence based) and 
non-rational (hope, faith) approaches and proposed a third category of in-between rationales (Zinn, 
2008, 2016). Even though the latter ones, such as trust and intuition, are not rational in the strong 
sense, they can be quite reasonable in some circumstances. Due to the fact that situations of 
uncertainty are inherently characterized by the lack of relevant information, the ideal of fully ratio­
nalizing the respective setting in order to control the outcome falls theoretically and empirically 
short (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974, 1987). Local, situational, and intuitive knowledge arising from 
subjective lifeworld is therefore often more efficient as well as trusting others considered knowing 
better. Furthermore, the non-rational, which is hardly considered in risk analysis but social sciences 
such as hope and faith are valuable in face of risk by providing a positive attitude towards the 
future, which may result in better outcomes or allow to engage in high-risk activities without per­
formance being negatively affected by fear and anxiety.
Zinn's assumption that lay people as well as experts refer to a mix of different rationales is 
also supported by neurological and behavioral research. As Damasio has shown, all decisions 
require both, rationality and emotions engaging both parts of the brain (Damasio, 1996) while 
Kahneman has described two ways of thinking, the faster intuitive and the slower reflexive way 
of thinking (Kahneman, 2011). Thus, it is not merely a question of one's values, interests, or 
experiences but there are deeper epistemological issues at work in the different rationales 
underpinning engagement with risk. Clarifying the epistemological issues can help to better 
understand and respond to the sometimes-counterintuitive rejection of empirically proven 
certitudes. In contrast to these dimensions of rational knowledge, our daily experience shows 
that there is this additional sphere of subjectively relevant certitudes, namely such ones like 
trust, intuition, emotion, love etc. that opposes to the subject in a pathic way. Such sensible 
certitudes are highly subjective and do not derive from reflection but happens to us evidently 
on the level of self-sensing.
Hence the analysis of dealing with risk and uncertainty faces an epistemological problem: 
these tacit forms of knowledge are 'merely' subjectively sensible, but at the same time they are 
highly evident to the self. It is precisely this categorially hardly tangible form of certainties that, 
in situations of risk, could either enable a person acting adequate, or could also get in oppo­
sition to rationally objectified facts. Considering this, the question comes into account how to 
itemize such sensible certitudes subject-theoretically? And, furthermore, to which degree this 
distinction can help to categorially sharpen the analysis of acting in situations of uncertainty?
In order to epistemologically elaborate the in-between and non-rational engagement with risk, 
the following sections develop a scheme of categorization that posits three relevant forms of 
knowledge. To this end, we shortly introduce some key arguments of the New Phenomenology 
before applying it to the findings of risk research. The mentioned approach, which was introduced 
by the German philosopher Hermann Schmitz (1928 - 2021), refers to the tradition of the philosophy 
of bodiliness or corporeality (in German 'Leiblichkeit'). By refining the research of Edmund Husserl 
(Husserl, 1976), Maurice Merleau-Ponty (Merleau-Ponty, 1962) and especially Martin Heidegger 
(Heidegger, 1967), Schmitz profoundly investigated the subjective dimension of sensible certitudes 
as they obviously play a crucial role in risk management. Thus, he unfolds an innovative and empir­
ically based way of understanding the experiences of our daily life. Dealing reasonably with situations 
of risk and uncertainty, as we will argue in our conclusions, depends on being in touch with the 
sensible sphere of self-givenness instead of merely trying to rationally dominate or overcome it.

3. The new phenomenology and its two-dimensional understanding of 
subjectivity
In order to develop an analytical model for risk research by using the neo-phenomenological 
epistemology, it is worth to initially distinguish two basic classes of knowledge, namely the 
reflexive and the non-reflexive. In this first rather rough differentiation2 the reflexive knowledge 
denotes all forms of creating objectivations by symbol-mediated thinking, whereas the category 
of non-reflexive represents that what undoubtedly occurs to the subject on the level of invol­
untary sensations. Though New Phenomenology does not refer to phenomenological sociology, 
it nevertheless seems to be helpful to shortly turn towards the early writings of Alfred Schütz 
to clarify the proposed distinction.
Before finally turning to the (classical) phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, Schütz (2013) 
started an attempt to work out his ideas in the early 1920s by using the time-theoretical inves­
tigations of Henri Bergson (Schütz, 1981). The key issue for Schütz at the time was the analytical 
problem that, in order to generate meaning structure by symbolic thinking, there logically needs 
to be a prior level of subjective experience. Otherwise, the process of unfolding meaning struc­
ture by symbolic representations would simply not have any content to reflect on. Schütz (2013, 
p. 31) hence speaks of the 'basic difference between experiences as such and the reflection 
about experiences - a difference important for many reasons' which, following Schütz, was firstly 
acknowledged by Henri Bergson. However, as Schütz in accordance with Bergson highlights, 
the non-reflexive sphere of experience, understood as the pure duration of the I, can hardly 
be grasped by symbolic representations. Schütz stresses:
Our experiencing is almost ever coupled with reflection about the experience. We control ourselves by 
our thinking; often we are unable to see the image on account of the concepts. Our consciousness of the 
stream of duration holds on only timidly to the unambiguous 'now' and 'thus', using them as rigid bound­
aries between which we squeeze our experiences-turned-into-concepts (Schütz, 2013, pp. 31).
Although this is obviously a conceptually problematic notion for classical epistemology, Schütz, 
inspired by Bergson and following logical considerations, distinguishes two ultimately incom­
mensurable spheres of experience. On the one hand we have the „continuum of changing 
experiences of quality 'which never stops and, hence, pertain to the realm of duration' (Schütz 
2013, pp. 35). On the other hand, due to our capability of reflexive thinking, we classify these 
always flowing experiences by using symbolic abstractions, and, hence, create a 'delimited realm 
of concepts' (Schütz 2013, pp. 35). Accordingly, Schütz, in his early writings, posits a tension 
between two distinct levels of experience: the involuntary occurring and non-reflexive on the 
one hand, and the reflexive and symbolically itemized on the other. This becomes clear in 
particular in the following passage which is crucial for the context of this article and the elab­
oration of our model. Regarding to the relation between the highly subjective and non-reflexive 
experience of quality differences on the one hand and its symbolic-mediated abstraction by 
reflexive thinking on the other, Schütz ascertained:
With every positing of a symbol, the I steps more [and more] 3 out of pure duration and into an objective 
world. To symbolize an experience means to rob it of its [character as a highly personal experience and 
its] belonging to a specific Now and Thus and, instead, to endow it with general validity. (Schütz, 2013, 
pp. 70)
Shortly summarized, objectifying an experience by reflexive thinking is about robbing its sub­
jective dimension step by step. Symbolic-mediated objectivity refers inevitably to non-reflexive 
experiences, which are always highly subjective. Though the non-reflexive knowledge hence 
constitutes the base of any objectivation, this whole sphere for Schütz, as a Neo-Kantian thinker, 
necessarily remained epistemologically problematic. After Schütz' turning to Husserl and

Heideggers' intention to itemize this aspect, Hermann Schmitz, the founder of New 
Phenomenology, revived that issue and worked out a highly elaborated epistemology by using 
the concept of bodiliness ('Leiblichkeit' in German).
Though Schmitz, as mentioned, does not refer to the work of Alfred Schütz, the basic tension 
between reflexive and non-reflexive knowledge plays a key role in New Phenomenology. In 
particular, by criticizing classical approaches of self-consciousness, Schmitz develops a 
two-dimensional understanding of subjectivity. The key argument is that there are phenome­
nologically two forms of self-consciousness, or in other words 'two sources of my access to 
acquaintance with myself' (Schmitz, 2018) (pp. 72) [translated by one of the authors]. While the 
definite description of other phenomena, as Schmitz (Schmitz et al., 2011)(pp. 248) argues, does 
indeed work by means of ascription this does not work related to self-consciousness. That which 
is to be identified in the latter case, Schmitz argues similar to Schütz, must already be known 
to avoid an infinite regress. Schmitz highlights (Schmitz, 2010):
Why should I be just Hermann Schmitz and not, for example, Alexander the Great? All objective facts, 
which one can state about Hermann Schmitz, carry no trace of the information that this man of all men 
is what I am. I know it only through my affective involvement, in that something comes close to me, 
which I can pursue with prudence, with the result that I find a range of circumstances in which I am 
entangled or, as Heidegger would say, in which I am thrown. This applies to every conscious entity, even 
to the one who, like an animal or an infant, cannot even say 'I' or even speak. (Schmitz 2010, pp. 22) 
[translated by one of the authors]
The own existence, Schmitz emphasizes, is not a positive fact, but in contrary a highly sub­
jective occurrence that happens to us by being bodily sensible affected. Before identifying 
oneself with any attribution, due to affective involvement, the self already knows whom to 
attribute at all. Schmitz (2010, pp. 14) calls this 'being conscious of oneself' (in German 
'Sichbewussthaben'). Only based on this is there anyone at all who can ascribe objectifying 
attributions to him or herself like name, age, profession, gender and so on. This second level 
Schmitz terms as 'to be conscious of oneself as something' (in German 'von sich als ein Etwas 
Bewusstgehabtwerden').
Eventually, the fruitful contribution of New Phenomenology in the context of this article is 
the empirically based itemization of the non-reflexive knowledge. While this sphere of subjective 
experience in Schütz' early writings remained a logically necessary but epistemologically prob­
lematic dimension, with New Phenomenology, it becomes conceptually itemizable and empirically 
verifiable.
To summarize this argument, self-consciousness without self-ascription occurs to us by bodily 
sensations like pain, fear, hunger, tiredness, shame or by being seized by feelings (Schmitz, 
1996)(pp. 23). The fact that this non-ascriptive self-consciousness has been neglected so long 
in philosophy and in other disciplines is certainly connected with its epistemologically prob­
lematic status. So bodily sensations are in the moment of affectedness as evident as possible. 
On the other part it is at the same time as subjective as something could be which makes it 
epistemologically suspicious. However, the whole sphere of pathic self-givenness is, 
neo-phenomenologically taken, the most evident and ultimately the most relevant level of our 
lived experience.
In this context it should be mentioned that the neo-phenomenological concept of 
non-reflexive self-givenness by bodily sensations is not merely a logical deduction by a phi­
losopher sitting in his armchair, doing philosophy of consciousness. In contrary, the insights 
of Schmitz have already been fruitfully applicated in various fields of research, e.g. in medicine 
(Burger, 2008; Danzer, 1993; Langewitz, 2008), in clinical psychology (Moldzio, 2006; Wendt, 
2015) or developmental psychology (Fuchs, 2000, 2008).
Finally, the neo-phenomenological model of a two-dimensional subjectivity exhibits an empir­
ically founded understanding of subjective experience that can help to conceptualize non-reflexive 

224

but undoubtedly sensible forms of certitudes like intuition or trust. Hence, we have an analytical 
tool to investigate the relevant levels of knowledge as they play a crucial role in the process 
of decision making in situations of risk and uncertainty. Beside the different forms of objectified 
knowledge (we go deeper into that in chapter 5), there are sensible certitudes which occurs 
to the self on the level of bodily sensations. Since such sensible certitudes are as evident as 
they are subjective, Schmitz terms it a dimension of 'subjective facts'.
4. The neo-phenomenological distinction of subjective and objective facts
According to these insights of New Phenomenology and its relevance for dealing with uncer­
tainty, the whole sphere of non-reflexive certitudes moves to the center of the considerations. 
As the phenomenological and psychological research evidently shows, we are primarily sensing 
entities that, only on the base of such sensible self-consciousness, are able to unfold the sphere 
of reflexive thinking. The latter one constitutes the mean of objectivation which can be either 
empirically founded (rationality), or rather metaphysical in the sense of an imaginative extension 
of one's horizon (faith and hope). Both of these two levels of knowledge, reflexive (rationality, 
hope and faith) and non-reflexive (intuition and trust) forms of certitudes (see Figure 1), as the 
risk-sociological research shows, are highly relevant for decision making. Following the episte­
mology of New Phenomenology, these two levels of certainties can be considered as subjective 
and objective, or more specifically, objectified facts.4 The rather contradictorily seeming term 
of 'subjective facts' is closely linked to the theory of self-consciousness presented above and is 
defined by Schmitz as following:
Such self-consciousness without self-ascription is made possible by the subjective facts peculiar to affective 
involvement. In their plain factuality, they already contain reference to oneself, respectively to the expe­
riencer. As a result, they can be predicated by, at most, one person under their own name. This stands in 
contrast to objective or neutral facts, which can be predicated by anyone, granted they know enough and 
are sufficiently articulate. The facts that are subjective for someone are richer in containing this subjectivity 
than the pale and neutral ones that result from the former by grinding down subjectivity. (Schmitz et al., 
2011)(p. 248f.)
Schmitz uses the scientifically provocative term of 'subjective facts' in order to emphasize, 
contrary to positivist transfigurations, that a fact, epistemologically, is first of all always a fact 
for someone. In this context it is crucial to understand that the aim of Schmitz' distinction of 
subjective and objective facts is definitely not to neglect or overplay the crucial difference of 
subjectivity and intersubjectivity. On the contrary, the way from subjective experience to 
intersubjective traceability, and hence to objectified knowledge can be adequately clarified by 
Figure 1.  Reflexive thinking versus non-reflexive selfgiveness.

225
this conceptional improvement of New Phenomenology. Hence, this approach shows that our 
lived experience, as Alfred Schütz already assumed, is characterized by a kind of ontological 
gap that could not be epistemologically suspended. Though positivist science pretends to 
neglect the sphere of subjectivity, it remains the epistemological ground even for science as 
e.g. Bruno Latour illustratively reconstructed (Latour, 1993). In order to get to the level of 
objectifications, one could say that the initially subjective facts must be deprived of their 
subjectivity by the means of symbolic representation; they have to reduce as much as possible 
the inherent subjective bias of any facticity.
However, this practice of objectification is an ambivalent capability of human subjects. 
As the philosopher and psychiatrist Thomas Fuchs argues in this context, depreciating or 
even completely ignoring the non-reflexive but sensible sphere of subjective certitudes 
provokes a highly problematic and potentially pathological self- and world-relation. Fuchs 
highlights:
Without affective contact the world gets 'on the other side' and freezes in empty existence, in dead facticity. 
This emptying falls back on the subject and contradicts Descartes' cogito: A human being who only thinks, 
who is not bodily-feelingly connected with the world, no longer 'lives', namely in the sense of the living 
existence that underlies all cognitions. The complete subject-object-separation, the stripping of all own 
from the alien, would therefore not produce the certainty of pure selfhood, but a nightmare of alienation. 
(Fuchs, 2008, S. 272) [translated by one of the authors]
To generalize this, our capability of objectifying sensible facts by symbolic representations, from 
the perspective of a concrete person, can provoke a kind of subjectively senseless factuality. It 
inherently exhibits the potency of turning into a frame of data that does not contain a relation 
to anybody, and therefore, arises as subjectively meaningless. The more successful subjective 
facts are neutralized, the more they lose their connection to a concrete person who is affected 
by the processed problem.
Finally, to come back to the topic of this article, this ontological gap is the reason why 
situations of risk and uncertainty necessarily requires strategies of in-between. It is the eventful 
openness of the respective situation itself that epistemologically commands us into a dialogue 
between the sensed and the objectified forms of certitudes. This of course becomes as prob­
lematic as possible in questions of existential threats. In situations of life-threatening circum­
stances, the objective fact that e.g. half of the population survives a medical treatment or dies 
of lung cancer due to the consumption of tobacco is not quite helpful. Due to the problem 
that even the most sophisticated statistic does not response to the ultimately relevant question 
'what does this say about my very concrete case?', the self continuously has to step into a 
dialogue between sensible and objectified facts, between reflexive and non-reflexive 
certainties.
To summarize this, the three-dimensional model of non-rational, in-between, and rational 
strategies of dealing with risk and uncertainty could be reformulated: While any subjective self 
is sensibly exposed to its own existence, as humans we are additionally able to emancipate 
from this situational structured entanglement by reflection. The result of this reflection can take 
the form of rational thinking, as well as constructing hope, beliefs and so on. We are thus 
analytically confronted with three forms of certainty, one of which belongs to the sensed (trust 
and intuition) and two to the reflexive (rationality on the one hand, and non-rational hope and 
faith on the other). In the next step we will sharpen this latter distinction and apply it to the 
empirical data of risk research.
5. Characterize different risk rationales by three forms of certainty
In situations of risk and uncertainty, as the previous sections have suggested, we are analytically 
confronted with three dimensions of relevant knowledge. Beyond the highly subjective 

226
M. SCHULZ AND J. O. ZINN
experience of bodily sensations (subjective facts), we find two additional forms of objectified 
certainties: rational and non-rational knowledge. We call the latter ones also 'objectified knowl­
edge' because they are result of the human capability of reflexive thinking as well. Due to this 
categorial overlap, we now propose a scheme to categorially distinguish these three forms 
(sensed, rational and non-rational) and, subsequently, apply it to empirical examples. The two 
crucial dimensions for our distinction are the level of being anchored in subjective lifeworld 
and the degree of empirical foundation of the respective knowledge.
We start with the aspect of being anchored in subjective lifeworld. It is clear that, for exam­
ple, the objective insight that half of the participants of a medical treatment survives the illness 
(rational knowledge) and the subjective faith that I as an affected person will belong to this 
half (non-rational knowledge) are, phenomenologically, crucially different forms of certainties. 
Though both are ultimately result of our capability of reflexive thinking and hence belong to 
the category 'objectified forms of knowledge', they obviously must be analytically distinguished. 
The crucial difference between such statistical data and other forms of reflexive thinking like 
faith and hope comprises in the level of being anchored in the respective lifeworld. That means 
that a fully rationalized fact like e.g. the survival probability of a medical treatment, phenom­
enologically, appears to the self as something that 'comes across' in the respective situation. 
Such highly abstract forms of certitudes are primarily alien and detached from the subjective 
lifeworld and hence need to be re-entangled to the self. A person that is confronted in a sit­
uation of risk with statistical evidence, at the first step, faces a cold factuality which needs to 
be re-entangled to him or her sphere of meaningfulness.
Contrary to this, the other forms of objectified knowledge, namely the metaphysical ones 
like hope or faith, arise from the subjective lifeworld. Though they are objectivations as well, 
generated by reflexive thinking, they are in the first place subjective. They are what we call 
forms of imaginative extensions of one's horizon towards a desired future. Hope and faith help 
the self to cope with a subjectively experienced situation of risk and uncertainty. However, 
these forms of reflexive generated knowledge, obviously, can unfold a collective sense as well 
as other objectivations do. Insofar as they achieve a power of conviction, jumping from one 
subjective lifeworld to another, they proliferate their capability of collective sense-making.
In order to distinguish the two forms of objectified knowledge, as mentioned, there is a 
second aspect that is analytically helpful. Rational facts on the one hand and hope and faith 
on the other are characterized by a different degree of empirical foundation. To clarify this, one 
could once again refer to the example of medical treatment and the probability of subjective 
survival: While the statistical knowledge about the effectiveness of a treatment is based on 
empirical data from the past, the hope that I, as a concrete and affected person will survive, 
is a kind of imaginative extension of one's horizon. Thus, both forms, rational and non-rational 
knowledge, are indeed result of the human capability of reflexive thinking. However, they have 
to be distinguished by the level of experience saturation. Rational facts result from former 
observations and hence are empirically founded. In contrary to this, non-rational results of 
reflexive thinking like hope and faith are less based in former experience but are focused on 
a desired and imagined future (Figure 2).
In summary, there are two categories by which the objectified forms of knowledge can be 
distinguished. Due to its level of abstraction, in the first place, rational knowledge often is 
experienced as something that is detached from the subjective lifeworld. These facts arise to 
the subject firstly as a potentially meaningless factuality that has to be re-entangled with the 
subjective living conditions of a concrete person. The other forms of abstract thinking, namely 
hope and faith, in contrast, are subjective from their origin. They arise from the lifeworld of 
the affected person but are less empirically grounded. They are rather a practice of constructing 
desired futures Figure 3.
The third form of certainties that are relevant for managing risk situations are the sensible 
ones, like trust and intuition. We call them subjective facts because they are experienced

involuntarily on the level of bodily sensations and can be hardly objectified. However, they 
share some categorial similarities with both of the former mentioned categories of objectified 
knowledge: On the one hand intuition and trust arise to the self as something that is sensible 
and non-reflexive, and consequently, is of course part of the subjective lifeworld as faith and 
hope are. On the other hand, intuition and trust are founded in former experience and thus 
are empirically grounded as rational knowledge. To summarize this, one could say that in par­
ticular rational and in-between strategies of managing risk are empirically grounded. The dif­
ference of such forms of acting is merely whether the relevant knowledge appears to the self 
on the level of reflection (rational) or on the level of bodily sensations (in between). Although 
non-rational knowledge, finally, is undoubtedly result of objectifying the respective situation as 
well as rational forms, it nevertheless is characterized by a low degree of empirical saturation 
(Figure 3).
5.1. Intuition, trust, hope and faith
The conceptual considerations provide the basis for exploring the differences between the 
non-rational and in-between rationales to be outlined in the following by empirical examples. 
Still, it has to be kept in mind that all these ideal type constructs usually mix in different ways 
and degrees using the specific advantages of each for managing risk. For example, when people 
from Senegal engaged in high risk boat journeys to the Canary Islands, they did not only refer 
to faith and hope but some also made sure that an experienced fishermen was steering the

boat they entered (Hernández-Carretero & Carling, 2012). Rational knowledge might be too 
complex or difficult to understand that people replace it by trust in experts or significant others. 
Own expertise can only provide some degree of certainty and there is always a little bit of 
hope involved that things turn out as calculated. Concepts themselves such as blind trust might 
increasingly be replaced by reflexive evaluation of who to trust as Anthony Giddens suggested. 
Still, each ideal type comes with specific characteristics we discuss in the following.
5.2. In-between: intuition and trust
There is a large body of research on intuitive engagement with risk. As Gary Klein has famously 
shown by many examples, people develop tacit knowledge on the basis of experience accu­
mulated over time to manage risky situations (Klein, 1998). Examples of professionals show how 
these learn to recognize intuitively typical situational patterns that inform their decision making. 
In one example he showed that nurses at a neonatal intensive care unit of a large hospital 
(1998, pp. 39-40) developed experience-based intuitive skills when caring for newly born infants 
who were premature or otherwise at risk. One of the difficult decisions these nurses had to 
make was to judge when a baby was developing a septic condition which becomes almost 
immediately life threatening. These nurses could intuitively sense the on-set of a sepsis and 
that they had to start the antibiotics (Crandall & Getchell-Reiter, 1993). Even though the nurses 
found it difficult to identify the signs and symptoms that enabled them to identify the early 
on-set of sepsis, in most cases their initial judgement was subsequently confirmed by tests. In 
other words, the intuitive knowledge, as we stressed above, is hardly objectifiable by reflexive 
thinking. In another example, a lieutenant with his firefighting crew came to a burning house 
and entered the building. They sprayed water on the fire in the kitchen area of the back of 
the building, but the fire just roared back to them. The lieutenant thought that this is odd, the 
water should have had more of an impact and started to feel that something wasn't right. He 
hadn't a clue what that was but when he and his crew left the building, the floor they had 
just been standing on collapsed. The lieutenant had no idea that the source of the fire was in 
the basement since such houses usually don't have a basement (Klein 1998: 32). These examples 
are characterized by people developing a sense for a situation they have experienced repeatedly. 
They have an immediate embodied sensation about the situation, a subjective certitude that 
manifests before they can reflect about it. Even after the decision they find it difficult to put 
the finger on the concrete aspects that informed their decision. Still, their decisions were deeply 
rooted in their experience.
For most risks, people are lacking this kind of direct personal knowledge but have to rely 
on others, such as experts (doctors, scientists, technicians) and the media reporting and explain­
ing expert knowledge. Their subjective certainty refers therefore to their relationship to others. 
As research has shown, perceived trustworthiness bases on at least two dimensions. First, trust 
builds over time and is experience based, judging one's competence reflexively. Second, people 
can also experience more immediate trust in others when perceiving similar values and interests 
and other dimensions characterising social relationships, thereby referring to more general social 
experiences (Barbalet, 2009; Lewis & Weigert, 1985). Most of the studies struggled to characterise 
trust well with the opposition of knowledge (rational) and faith (non-rational) focussing on 
reflexive objectifications (Möllering, 2006). In contrast, we suggest that trust is rooted phenom­
enologically in subjectively experienced certainties rooted in tacit knowledge and subjective 
facts. The knowledge gap to be bridged by a 'leap of faith' characterising trust, as Guido 
Möllering suggested, overlooks the subjective experience of trustworthiness in between.
In summary, trust and intuition sharply differ by the connection to knowledge. Intuition as 
an embodied experience refers to an immediate embodied experience of a risky situation while 
trust refers to the risky reality mediated through the experience with others. The subjective 
certitudes refer to the sensed and experienced trustworthiness of others.

5.3. Non-rational but reasonable: hope and faith
Hope helps people to cope with the risky uncertainties of the future. Even when one rationally 
calculates the odds there is regularly a place for hope that nothing has been overlooked and 
no unexpected events happen. Hope comes with a positive attitude, which might have positive 
effects itself, such as staying calm in high-risk situations. As well as rational thinking, it is a 
form of emancipating from the concrete situation by reflection. However, as we showed above, 
hope and faith are hardly empirically grounded but are oriented towards a desired future. Also, 
the positive effects of hope for healing have been recognized (Snyder et al., 1991; Yıldırım & 
Arslan, 2020). Therefore, one might argue that hope can similarly be experience-based than the 
other concepts. However, the advantage of hope in contrast to mainly empirically based con­
cepts such as intuition and trust is the imaginative extension of one's horizon that is based not 
on external conditions but primarily on subjective certitudes. The proverb, 'hope dies last', 
expresses the empirically detached reality of hope that can be maintained even against all 
odds. Hope is therefore particularly powerful for engaging with high-risk activities to overcome 
undesired realities such as illegal migration to escape poverty or political prosecution or even 
to initiate revolution (Bloch, 1986; Hayenhjelm, 2006; Hernández-Carretero & Carling, 2012). 
Bloch emphasizes the importance of an imagined positive future state, as a basis of hoping, to 
questioning and overcoming an undesired present.
Similarly to hope, in risk studies faith has often been interpreted in contrast to rationality. 
The focus on faith in managing risks would prevent efficient risk management. Instead, the 
felt certitude that one's future is in the hand of God or supernatural powers, would support 
passivity and lack of precaution (Renn, 2008). For example, the attribution of road accidents 
to superstitious sources is often seen as a reason for lacking engagement in road-safety 
measures (Kayani et al., 2017). Thus, faith is detached from empirical reality but is strongly 
connected with the subjective lifeworld. Its intensity does less rely on empirical facts but 
one's mental state. For example, the religious conversion or satori is less based on empirical 
realities but subjective experience. Faith in God is a highly personal and subjective experi­
ence and people enjoy the positive feelings and direction coming with their faith even when 
empirically or logically unjustified. The subjectively experienced certitudes of faith do, how­
ever, not mean that there is no active engagement with the world possible. Instead, Lois 
Bastide (Bastide, 2015) argued in a study on Indonesian migrant workers that these are well 
aware of the risks of abuse or even death but the 'dangerous journey, was [interpreted as] 
a powerful way of proving the depth of their religious commitment ... quite paradoxically, 
taking risks was thus perceived as a means of avoiding risks; proving one's fate in the 
Almighty was understood as a way of seeking God's shelter' (Bastide 2015: 235-6). As Bastide 
explains (2015: 239): 'It is true that the individuals perceive themselves as being dominated 
by destiny. However, they experience their power of action elsewhere: through their capacity 
of attention and their aptitude to decipher and decrypt the signs disseminated on their 
path, but also in their ability to take advantage of the elusive openings of a destiny accord­
ing to these clues.' The subjectively experienced certitudes remain and adapt to an 
ever-changing empirical reality providing a feeling of security in face of an in principle 
uncertain future. It is the personal sensation of a strong faith and the careful reading of the 
cues given in one's life rather than personal skills or control of a risky situation, which shapes 
one's engagement and coping with risk.
In summary, hope is less institutionalized than faith, but both are (contrary to highly abstract 
forms of rational knowledge) strongly anchored in people's subjective lifeworld. Even though 
we stressed that these non-rational forms of objectifying the current life conditions are less 
empirically grounded, this could be indeed the case when in the long run one might have 
made the experience that it is better to hope or turn to one's faith to manage the risks and 
uncertainties of everyday life. It is important to keep in mind that hope as well as faith can be

encouraged by social institutions but are typically not based on evidence (Brown, 2007; Brown 
et al., 2015; Cook, 2017).
6. Conclusions: from the subjective lifeworld to reasonable risk management
As both the former neo-phenomenologically founded analysis as well as the shift in risk studies 
indicate, it is worthwhile to engage with the variety of subjectively relevant forms of knowledge. 
Instead of deprecating all that is not result of rational thinking, our approach allowed us to 
itemize the subjectively experienced situations of risk and uncertainty. Hence, it becomes pos­
sible to categorize the relevant forms of knowledge by an epistemologically coherent and 
empirically grounded theory. Applied to typical examples of the sphere of risk, we argued that 
sensible certitudes like trust and intuition have, as typical for non-reflexive knowledge, a deeper 
rooting in one's experience of the life world. In contrast, scientific expertise as provided by 
experts requires a re-attachment to become subjectively meaningful, for example, mediated 
through trust in others. In addition to the rational forms of itemizing current life circumstances, 
there are other ways of objectifying subjective reality, namely the metaphysical objectivations 
like hope and faith. As we argued, the latter ones are of course less empirically grounded than 
rational thinking, they are non-rational, but however, could be quite helpful and also reasonable 
in situations of high risk and uncertainty.
The subjective certitudes challenge risk communication. Intuitive evaluation of trustworthi­
ness might be misleading, when the trusted others relate well to one's lifeworld but not to 
the more empirically based interpretation of risk. It then requires people to challenge deeper 
social certainties of their lived experiences which go beyond specific risks but are based on 
intuitive knowledge. Evidence-based risk communication becomes even more difficult when 
addressing empirically detached subjective certitudes, which people adhere to because of their 
advantages in managing risk and uncertainty cognitively and emotionally. Having an important 
function in coping with everyday life, it fundamentally challenges risk communication, which 
bases on the communication of scientific expertise. As a result, risk communication shifted 
towards a stronger focus on managing the relationship between involved parties and should 
thereby be understood as a social process that takes place in the public sphere rather than 
merely a performance of communicators. Experts in risk communication such as Ortwin Renn 
have emphasized the need for participative and deliberative approaches with high procedural 
legitimacy (Renn, 2008), which, when well applied, increases the likelihood of high compliance 
with and support for risky decisions. Others have also emphasized the importance of reducing 
practical hurdles, for example, for coronavirus vaccination and nudging people into compliance 
with desired behavior (Evans & French, 2021; French, 2017). Still, in practice, many insights 
from risk communication research are not well considered in cases of crisis such as during the 
management of Covid-19 (Wardman, 2020). Since public responses to risk are not only informed 
by expert knowledge, different values and competing interests but subjective certainties, there 
are epistemological hurdles which are difficult to overcome. It is extremely unlikely that people 
give up on deeply rooted certainties connected to the embodied experienced truths of one's 
life world for the sake of successful risk management. Confrontational strategies and coercion, 
such as with compulsory vaccination, would even increase resistance if not accompanied by 
extensive efforts of risk communication. When social risk communication is done well, oblig­
atory measures might not even be necessary (Vanderslott & Marks, 2021).
In summary, this article argues that it would be fruitful to empirically and theoretically 
acknowledge the variety of certitudes which are involved in subjective risk management. Only 
by empowering the subjects to step into a dialogue to him- or herself, namely in order to find 
a solution for the not rationalizable openness of the respective presence and its inherent 
uncertainty, can reason be practically realized by human subjects.

As initially mentioned, we will expand this analytical distinction in section 5 further into a three-dimensional 
model. In order to do so, we will differentiate the objectified knowledge, resulting from reflexive thinking, 
into rational and non-rational forms by using the categories of being anchored in subjective lifeworld and 
the level of empirical foundation.

In the coming section we will sharpen the distinction between the two forms of objectivations generat­
ed by reflection, namely rationality on the one hand, and hope and faith on the other. The two crucial 
differences are the degree of empirical foundation and the level of being anchored in the subjective 
lifeworld.
