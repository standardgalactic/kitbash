ABSTRACT
Consider reading the news about the recent election, taking part in a classroom 
discussion about injustice, or having a conversation about dinner, with your 
friend. In these cases, you rely on your capacity for linguistic understanding. 
How do we come to understand what other people communicate to us on 
particular occasions? In recent philosophical debates about this question, we 
find two broad approaches: the perceptual approach, which claims that we 
come to understand an utterance by employing broadly perceptual 
capacities to perceive or quasi-perceive the utterance's meaning; and the 
inferential approach, which claims that we come to understand an utterance 
by employing broadly inferential capacities to infer what is being conveyed 
by an utterance. This paper focuses on the debates concerning these two 
approaches. We provide conceptual and methodological clarifications 
regarding linguistic understanding and introduce some of the key 
philosophical debates concerning its nature, including those concerning its 
phenomenology and underlying psychology, with a focus on the role of 
perception and inference. We also discuss some epistemological questions 
concerning the understanding of linguistic utterances and different views 
that try to explain its epistemological role(s). This paper is an introduction to 
the special issue 'Linguistic Understanding: Perception and Inference'.

Consider reading the news about the recent election, taking part in a 
classroom discussion about injustice, or having a conversation about 
dinner, with your friend. In these cases, you rely on your capacity for lin­
guistic understanding. This capacity is clearly central to our lives. It allows 
us to engage in complex interactions with others. It makes it possible to

share knowledge, coordinate action, and generate social systems. It is 
therefore important to have a grasp of how this capacity works, and to 
understand its role in knowledge sharing and other practices. How do 
we come to understand what other people communicate to us on par­
ticular occasions?1 In this paper, we provide an introduction to the 
special issue 'Linguistic Understanding: Perception and Inference' which 
contributes to addressing this question. The special issue focuses on 
two approaches to address it which are central in recent philosophical 
debates: on the one hand, what one might call the inferential approach, 
which emphasizes the role of making inferences in coming to understand 
an utterance (e.g. Allott 2023, this issue; Carston 2002; Sperber and Wilson 
1995; Stanley 2005); and, on the other hand, the perceptual approach, 
which claims that we come to understand an utterance by employing 
broadly perceptual capacities, allowing us to perceive or quasi-perceive 
the utterance's meaning (e.g. Brogaard 2018, 2020; Fricker 2003; Nes 
2017; Recanati 2002).2 What is the nature and role of inference in linguistic 
understanding? Can the semantic properties of utterances be perceived? 
If not, how do we gain access to them? What implications do perceptual 
and the inferential approach have for current debates in the epistem­
ology of linguistic understanding and testimony? Questions regarding 
these two approaches have been discussed in several strands of literature 
in philosophy of language and pragmatics. They also connect with many 
central issues in current debates in philosophy of mind and language, as 
well as epistemology, including the epistemology of testimony and lin­
guistic understanding; and the epistemology and metaphysics of percep­
tion. Linguistic understanding is a topic investigated within a wide range 
of disciplines, in particular, in the subfields of linguistics (see e.g. Elder and 
Haugh 2024). Although we focus here on philosophical discussions, phi­
losophical approaches to linguistic understanding often engage with 
the literature on the topic in linguistics and cognitive science and this 
will be reflected in some of the material presented in this special issue.
In what follows, we provide some conceptual and methodological clar­
ifications concerning linguistic understanding (section 2). We also intro­
duce some of the key philosophical debates concerning the nature of 
linguistic understanding, including discussions of its phenomenology 
and underlying psychology, with a focus on the role of perception and 
inference (section 3). We then introduce epistemological questions 
1The question is to be understood as covering utterances in different linguistic modalities and forms of 
communication, where spoken utterances are one case to consider.
2There is also room for a third approach: linguistic understanding is neither inferential or perceptual.

concerning the understanding of linguistic utterances and different views 
that try to explain its epistemological role(s) (section 4). The latter two sec­
tions also briefly introduce the following six papers in this special issue (in 
alphabetical order): (1) Nicholas Allott: Encapsulation, inference and utter­
ance comprehension; (2) Brendan Balcerak Jackson: Inferential practical 
knowledge of meaning; (3) Berit Brogaard: The rational roles of experi­
ences of utterance meanings; (4) Elvira Di Bona: A disjointed account of 
the illusion of auditory continuity: in favor of hearing everyday sounds 
but against hearing semantic properties; (5) Steven Gross: Is there an 
empirical case for semantic perception?; (6) Anders Nes: (Non-)conceptual 
representation of meaning in utterance comprehension.
2. Conceptual and methodological clarifications
What is linguistic understanding? And how do philosophers investigate 
it? In this section we make some terminological and conceptual clarifica­
tions, comment on methodological assumptions and choices in recent 
debates, as well as introduce the main types of questions that animate 
current philosophical debates concerning linguistic understanding.
2.1. Linguistic understanding - a complex concept
One can understand sentences, words and other linguistic items, but one 
can also understand linguistic utterances made by particular people on 
particular occasions. We might call this latter form of linguistic under­
standing 'utterance understanding'. Utterance understanding can 
involve different kinds of understanding, because an utterance involves 
multiple layers of meaning. The words uttered mean something, and 
the words combined form a sentence that typically means something, 
and the speaker means something by uttering the sentence. One can 
understand a particular word on an occasion, or understand the conven­
tional meaning of the sentence uttered, without understanding what the 
speaker means. The focus of this special issue is primarily on understand­
ing what the speaker means.3 Upon hearing (reading, seeing, or sensing, 
depending on the modality involved) an utterance of a language, interlo­
cutors familiar with that language may come to understand what that 
3Note that we can ask whether understanding of each layer of meaning is best characterized as percep­
tual or inferential, and that one may hold different views with respect to each layer. For example, one 
might hold that our understanding of the conventional meaning of an utterance is perceptual, but at 
the same time hold that speaker meaning must be inferred (cf. Nes 2017; Reiland 2015).

utterance means on a given occasion. For example, upon hearing Leon 
uttering (1) 'Shall we have a coffee?', Hibo comes to understand the 
content and force of that utterance, i.e. that Leon invites him to a 
coffee at a particular time specified by the context in which that utterance 
is produced. Guy Longworth (2008) provides a helpful distinction 
between three senses of understanding that may be relevant for captur­
ing what it is to understand an utterance: (a) achievement-understanding 
- 'an episode of coming to understand the utterance - perhaps an 
episode in which one becomes aware of, or comes to know, the 
meaning of the utterance'; (b) state-understanding - 'the outputs of epi­
sodes of achievement-understanding', 'perhaps a state of knowing that 
the utterance means p/the meaning of the utterance/what the utterance 
means'; (c) ability-understanding - 'the source (or, more minimally, the 
habitual or dispositional) of episodes of achievement-understanding' 
(50-51). Drawing on this three-partite distinction, we can describe in 
more detail the example above: Hibo possesses ability-understanding 
of sentences of the form used in (1), and is thus disposed to achieve- 
understand utterance (1), thereby becoming the subject of a state of 
understanding utterance (1).
What do we come to grasp when we understand what a speaker meant 
by an utterance? This can be captured in terms of the content and force of 
the utterance (Fricker 2003), or what is said by it (Brogaard 2018; Gasparri 
and Murez 2021; Nes 2017; Recanati 2004),4 as well as its implicatures and 
the speaker's attitude to the proposition expressed (see Allott 2023, this 
issue). Arguably, what we come to grasp when we understand an utter­
ance is a meaning that is saturated with contextual information about 
referents, lexical modulation, scope disambiguation, and possibly other 
things (for discussion see e.g. Reiland 2015).
In recent years there has been a growing philosophical interest in char­
acterizing the nature of linguistic understanding and the kind of psychol­
ogy and epistemology that governs it. Much of the work has focused on 
the nature of states of understanding (Longworth's (b) above). As a result, 
we find a plethora of views on how to describe this phenomenon. Linguis­
tic understanding of an utterance expressing P has been characterized as, 
for example: 
4The notion of what is said is a technical term that is used differently by different authors. Some take 
what is said to be closely tied to the conventional meaning of the sentence uttered, and others 
take what is said to depart greatly from the conventional meaning (see Saul 2012, chapter 2 for an 
overview; see Schoubye and Stokke 2016 for a recent development). For the purposes of this introduc­
tion, we take what is said to be constrained by the meaning encoded in the uttered sentence, but we 
allow contextual contributions that go beyond reference-fixing and disambiguation (Carston 2002).

knowledge that the speaker said that P (Evans 1982, 311; Heck 1995, 84);
conscious awareness that the speaker said that P (Hunter 1998, 560);
quasi-perception that the speaker said that P (Fricker 2003, 341);
a perceptual seeming that the speaker said that P (Brogaard 2018, 2020);
a state of entertaining the content P (Longworth 2018, 822);
a belief that P (Millikan 2004, 121; cf. Mandelbaum 2014);
This list, adapted from Carter et al. (2021), is likely to be a non-exhaustive 
one, as philosophical debates about linguistic understanding are flourish­
ing.5 In addition, some have argued that we should take a pluralist 
approach to utterance understanding (Brogaard 2024, this issue; Dänzer 
2017; Grodniewicz 2023). Others have argued that more philosophical 
attention should be given to utterance understanding as a process (Grod­
niewicz 2021).6 We will look at some of the above listed views more 
closely in sections 3 and 4.
Some terminological remarks are in order. As noted by Berit Borgaard 
(2024, this issue, 3 ft. 4), the terms 'utterance understanding' and 'compre­
hension' (or 'utterance comprehension', e.g. Gross 2024; Nes 2022, this 
issue) are often used in debates concerning linguistic understanding, 
but not always to designate the same phenomenon. 'Utterance under­
standing' is typically used as a success term (Brogaard 2024, this issue), 
i.e. on many views having an inaccurate attitude about what was said 
with an utterance or lacking sufficient support for that attitude does 
not qualify as utterance understanding (e.g. Balcerak Jackson 2019; Bro­
gaard 2018, 2020; Fricker 2003). This is compatible with the above 
description of our example in terms of achievement-understanding of 
(1). However, on some views utterance understanding is taken to typically 
be somewhat inaccurate, given that there may be some degree of (often 
benign) mismatch between what the speaker is trying to communicate 
and what the audience takes the speaker to be communicating. Thus 
the proponents of such views may abstain from using the notion of 
understanding as a success term. Alternatively, one may claim that 
5See also Rumfitt (2005). He provides an account of utterance understanding, or what he calls rhetic 
understanding, in terms of a second-order cognitive capacity: 
In the case of sayings—although not of orders—a state of rhetic understanding also provides 
for the reverse sort of acquisition, whereby knowledge of the world grounds knowledge of the 
truth and falsity of sayings. In either case, rhetic understanding may be classified as a second- 
order cognitive capacity: one who possesses it is in a position to gain new knowledge from old. 
(Rumfitt 2005, 444)
6In addition, there is a closely related debate about the nature of linguistic understanding in the ability 
sense. One prominent view characterizes our understanding of words and sentences as (tacit) prop­
ositional knowledge of the meaning of those words and sentences, but this view has come under 
attack (see e.g. McDowell 1981; Pettit 2002). Brogaard (2024, this issue) connects this debate with 
the debate about the nature of states of utterance understanding.

communication can be successful even without a complete match 
between the proposition expressed and the proposition recovered (see 
Pollock 2020). On the other hand, terms like 'utterance comprehension' 
and 'utterance understanding' are sometimes used to refer to states 
representing a speaker as having said something whether or not they 
are accurate or whether their content is similar to any content communi­
cated (e.g. a hallucination as of a speaker having said that P might count 
as a state of utterance understanding according to such use).7
Finally, we must note that 'utterance interpretation' (e.g. Allott 2023, 
this issue) and 'utterance understanding' are sometimes used, particularly 
in certain strands of pragmatics, to describe the process of arriving at 
utterance meaning or interpretation (e.g. Carston 1997; Sperber and 
Wilson 1995), rather than the state which such processes give rise to. 
Questions about whether utterance understanding is perceptual or not 
are sometimes posed in terms of states(are states of understanding per­
ceptual or perceptual-like states?), and sometimes in terms of processes 
(are the psychological processes that give rise to states of understanding 
perceptual processes or inferential processes?) In this special issue, both 
questions are addressed.
2.2. Varieties of linguistic understanding
Understanding an utterance may happen in various contexts where inter­
locutors have specific goals and where the process of comprehension is 
constrained by various internal factors (e.g. attention span, mood) and 
external factors (stakes, distractions). Notwithstanding this variability, lin­
guistic understanding is typically taken to be smooth and effortless. As 
linguistic conversations unfold, in many cases participants do not seem 
to exercise deliberate attention to achieve linguistic understanding. 
Rather, as they encounter utterances, they effortlessly and without reflec­
tion grasp linguistic information, update their beliefs and sub-personally 
plan conversational moves. To illustrate: when Hibo hears Leon uttering 
(1) above in a specific context where certain background assumptions 
are shared, he is likely to immediately understand that utterance as an 
invitation to grab some coffee. This kind of seamless linguistic under­
standing has been at the center of current philosophical debates, 
where the typical phenomenology and the process of linguistic 
7In addition, the term 'comprehension-based belief' is sometimes used to describe beliefs about what 
the speaker said with an utterance formed on the basis of direct exposure to the utterance (rather 
than, say, testimony), that need not be accurate or well justified (e.g., Grodniewicz 2022).

understanding are described as: immediate (e.g. Fricker 2003; Nes 2017; 
O'Callaghan 2011; Reiland 2015), unreflective and effortless (e.g. Gross 
2024), rapid and without conscious effort (e.g. Allott 2023, this issue). 
We return to these observations in section 3.
And yet, linguistic understanding can, in some instances, take a more 
deliberate, reflective form. To illustrate, we can imagine cases where 
Hibo is uncertain about the force of Leon's utterance (1), i.e. he may be 
wondering whether upon uttering (1) Leon is inviting him to a coffee 
or rather requesting a coffee break during a longer work meeting. The 
latter interpretation may perhaps be suitable in some professional con­
texts. In such cases, in order to understand (1), Hibo may need to con­
sciously reflect on the two alternative interpretations, consider 
information about the context, or retrieve some background assumptions 
about the situation.8 Robyn Carston (2010) argues that there are two 
types of processing that may underlie utterance interpretation. One is 
spontaneous and 'local', the other 'global' and reflective, as for example 
in understanding of some metaphors. Allott (2023, this issue, 26) discusses 
cases of revisable interpretation, i.e. when a speaker reflects on whether 
what they initially understood an utterance to mean is correct or not. 
He notes that such reflective revisions may perhaps be performed by a 
faculty different from the one that usually performs utterance interpret­
ation and tentatively suggests that Carston's reflective mode of interpret­
ation may be involved. Cases of reflective, deliberate interpretation raise a 
number of interesting questions. For example, in both theoretical and 
non-theoretical contexts, in order to reflectively come to understand an 
utterance, interlocutors may need to draw on cognitive, reflective, meta­
linguistic and metacognitive abilities. The level and scope of such abilities 
can vary quite a lot. Literacy, background knowledge, and shared cultural 
assumptions are only some examples of differences that may affect 
whether and how language users can engage in such deliberations. The 
nature and scope of those skills and abilities as well as the epistemology 
governing the reflective mode of linguistic understanding are not well 
understood. We note here that cases of reflective, effortful understanding 
of utterances have received relatively little attention in recent philosophi­
cal work and may thus not be explained by many theories concerning the 
8One could argue that cases of reflective post hoc analysis are a further step of clarifying the contents or 
thoughts communicated by speakers via linguistic utterances (see Carter et al. 2021 for a distinction 
along these lines). It seems however that in some cases comprehenders are already tuned to 
attend to language in a more reflective manner and utilize deliberate attention, e.g. when focusing 
on a metaphor, a proof, etc.

nature and epistemology of linguistic understanding that focus on 
smooth and effortless comprehension. The perceptual approach, for 
instance, might struggle to account for such cases, and the correct 
approach might be to claim that the inferential approach best captures 
some varieties of interpretation, while the perceptual approach captures 
other ones.
How do philosophers investigate linguistic understanding? Our 
example of understanding utterance (1) by Hibo illustrates well cases 
used in philosophical debates concerning linguistic understanding. 
When analyzing linguistic understanding, philosophers tend to work 
with isolated cases of understanding an utterance, whereby a single, typi­
cally declarative, sentence uttered in a minimally stipulated context is the 
preferred unit of analysis. At the same time, the interpreter's task is rather 
generic, i.e. to understand the asserted content (and force) of the sen­
tence uttered in a stipulated context. However, it is important to note 
that this approach simplifies the phenomenon a bit. In many conversa­
tions, interlocutors take turns so quickly, that it is reasonable to assume 
that the processes responsible for utterance comprehension and 
speech production overlap to some degree and unfold dynamically 
(Garrod and Pickering 2015; Levinson 2016).9 To illustrate, consider the 
following conversation unfolding between Leon and Hibo. For the sake 
of this example, imagine that Hibo only drinks decaf and is not aware 
of a nearby place that sells it: 
Leon:
Shall we have a coffee? (1)
Hibo:
You might. (2)
Leon:
There's a new place by the station ... (3)
Hibo:
Oh yeah, they might have it. (4)
In this case, in uttering (2) Hibo reminds Leon by means of prosody, i.e. 
stress on the word 'you', that he only drinks decaf coffee. Leon immedi­
ately understands what Hibo wants to communicate with (2) and 
suggests visiting a new place (utterance (3)). Hibo seems open to this sug­
gestion (utterance (4)). Although decaf coffee is nowhere explicitly men­
tioned in this dialogue, given the context and shared background 
assumptions, it is clear to Leon and Hibo that the pronoun 'it' in (4) 
refers to decaf coffee. In order to achieve linguistic understanding in 
typical dynamically unfolding conversations, comprehenders will often 
have to track information across several utterances and gradually 
9See Grodniewicz (2021) for a recent discussion of implications these observations could have for phi­
losophical debates on linguistic understanding.
8 
A. DROŻDŻOWICZ AND K. P. PHILLIPS

accumulate information provided by the speaker and made available in 
the conversational context. For example, in order to understand (4), 
Leon has to grasp (2) as implicitly indicating that Hibo needs decaf 
coffee and tacitly assume that Hibo is referring with the pronoun 'they' 
to the same place mentioned in (3). Moreover, in some cases, an utterance 
produced and comprehended earlier may be understood only later as the 
dialogue unfolds. These observations seem to suggest that linguistic 
understanding can unfold across utterances. Thus, it may be argued 
that a piece of dialogue, not an isolated utterance, may be a natural 
unit of analysis when discussing linguistic understanding (for discussion 
of such dialogue data in the context of linguistic understanding, see Grod­
niewicz 2021).
As we can see, linguistic understanding relies heavily on utilizing con­
textual and background information. This point is further explicated in 
Allott (2023, this issue), who provides a detailed discussion of ways in 
which interpretation of utterances is sensitive to 'practically any infor­
mation' (4). At the same time, we note that whether all information uti­
lized in the process of utterance interpretation is epistemically relevant 
for arriving at an interpretation is a complicated matter. For example, 
interpretation about the speaker and their identity may, in some cases, 
allow us to form certain epistemically useful expectations about what 
the speaker wants to communicate and thus aid linguistic understanding. 
Take our example again: if Leon knows that Hibo gets mildly anxious after 
drinking caffeinated coffee, he may be more likely to arrive at the correct 
interpretation of utterance (2). At the same time, certain types of miscon­
ceptions about the speaker, including those concerning their identity, 
may affect the process and epistemic outcome of utterance interpretation 
in ways that do not aid understanding of an utterance. Andrew Peet 
(2017) has argued that prejudicial stereotypes that infect credibility judg­
ments, i.e. judgements of whether and to what extent one trusts what the 
speaker said that are commonly discussed in cases of epistemic injustice 
(Fricker 2007), can also infect our interpretation of the speaker, leading to 
uncharitable interpretation. He calls such cases 'interpretative injustice'. 
To illustrate, Peet discusses experimental studies suggesting that 
various perceived identity characteristics of a speaker, such as gender 
(e.g. Brooks et al. 2014), voice and manner of speaking (e.g. Van 
Berkum et al. 2008), may have an impact on utterance interpretation in 
a manner that hinders linguistic understanding, occasionally leading to 
interpretative injustice.

2.3. Bringing strands of research together
Having made the above clarifications, we can separate three kinds of 
questions about linguistic understanding thus specified: 
1. Broadly metaphysical questions: What is the nature of linguistic 
understanding?
2. Broadly epistemological questions: What is the epistemological role of 
linguistic understanding?
3. Broadly psychological questions: What are the psychological mechan­
isms that give rise to linguistic understanding?
Discussions of linguistic understanding often cross-cut these 
three areas, but we believe that there is a good reason to further bring 
discussions of these questions together. This is because answers to ques­
tions within one area may interestingly depend on answers to questions 
in another area. For instance, an account of the epistemological role of 
linguistic understanding may involve certain assumptions about its 
nature and the psychological mechanisms that give rise to it. Suppose 
one claims that states of understanding can provide non-inferential jus­
tification for beliefs about what is said, and so offers a response to an epis­
temological question. Plausibly, such a view depends on the plausibility of 
an answer to a broadly metaphysical question about the nature of states 
of understanding. States of understanding can plausibly only play such an 
epistemological role if they are non-doxastic: if they are doxastic, then 
they themselves stand in need of justification in order to provide justifica­
tion, so they can't provide non-inferential justification. The view also 
seems to depend on an answer to a broadly psychological question. 
States of understanding can plausibly only provide non-inferential justifi­
cation if they are the output of a narrowly non-inferential process: if they 
are the output of an inferential process, then, plausibly, the justification 
provided by the state of understanding will depend at least in part on 
the justification of the premise states of the inference, so that the justifi­
cation of a belief about what is said will turn out to be inferential (cf. 
Bezuidenhout 1998).
This provides a reason to hold that epistemological inquiry into linguis­
tic understanding may benefit from engaging closely with broadly meta­
physical and psychological inquiry into linguistic understanding (cf. Burge 
2013; 2020). Likewise, it may be incumbent upon certain strands of 
psychological inquiry to engage with epistemological and metaphysical 
10 
A. DROŻDŻOWICZ AND K. P. PHILLIPS

inquiry. Communication is plausibly a rational activity (cf. Heck 2006; 
Hickman 2021) and involves the transmission of knowledge and other 
epistemic goods, and any psychological account of linguistic understand­
ing should arguably square with this. Furthermore, a broadly metaphys­
ical inquiry may benefit from engaging with psychological and 
epistemic inquiry into linguistic understanding. For example, it seems 
that an account of the nature of states of understanding which is not sen­
sitive to their causal and epistemological role will face serious objections 
(cf. Longworth 2018).
We have prima facie good reasons to investigate the three types of 
questions in tandem, and to bring research within each area to bear on 
research in the other areas.
3. The nature and psychology of linguistic understanding - 
perception and inference
As mentioned in section 2.1, there are multiple ways of characterizing lin­
guistic understanding. In this section, we discuss some selected views on 
the nature of linguistic understanding and the psychological mechanisms 
that give rise to linguistic understanding that concern the role of percep­
tion and inference, respectively. As noted above, this debate is sometimes 
framed in terms of states of understanding, e.g. whether such states are 
perceptual in nature or not, and sometimes in terms of the psychological 
processes that eventuate such states, e.g. whether and in what sense such 
processes are perceptual or inferential. In what follows, we discuss both 
types of questions.
3.1. Perception and linguistic understanding
There seems to be an intuitive difference between having a perceptual 
mental state, such as hearing the sound of a siren or seeing a yellow 
flower, and having a cognitive mental state, such as thinking about the 
sound of a siren or imagining a yellow flower. The difference seems to 
be in the nature of these mental states. The distinction between percep­
tion and cognition has a prominent place in discussions concerning the 
nature (and epistemology) of mental states in philosophy of mind and 
perception (for recent discussions see e.g. Block 2023; Clarke and Beck 
2023; Nes, Sundberg, and Watzl 2023). There are multiple competing 
views on how to draw the divide between perception and cognition, 
including appeals to phenomenology, revisability, modularity, the 
INQUIRY 
11

format of the representations involved, and stimulus-dependence (for 
overview, see Clarke and Beck 2023; Nes, Sundberg, and Watzl 2023). 
Arguably, language and linguistic understanding are an interesting case 
to consider when discussing the divide between perception and cogni­
tion (see Gross 2023).
In recent years, the distinction between perception and cognition has 
been discussed in the context of linguistic understanding. As noted, 
typical seamless cases of linguistic understanding are (or involve) states 
that appear to be immediate. According to some philosophers, there 
are some theoretically interesting similarities between perception and lin­
guistic understanding. In particular, it has been argued that properties like 
having meaning x can be perceived (e.g. Bayne 2009; Brogaard 2018; 
Siegel 2006; see also Nes 2017; cf. O'Callaghan 2011), whereby under­
standing of linguistic utterances involves experiences in which high- 
level meaning properties are perceived. We will provisionally call this 
view 'the semantic perceptual view' noting that it comes in many var­
ieties. Examples that contrast cases of hearing an utterance and under­
standing it with cases of hearing the same utterance without 
understanding it (so-called 'contrast cases') are typically used to illustrate 
and discuss the immediate experience or phenomenology of linguistic 
understanding (e.g. Bayne 2009; Brogaard 2018, 2020; Dodd 2014; O'Cal­
laghan 2011; Siegel 2006). The proponents of the semantic perceptual 
views would typically also point to some prima facie similarities 
between uncontroversially perceptual experiences and experiences one 
has when understanding a linguistic utterance. For example, the involun­
tary and automatic nature of understanding (e.g. Burge 2013; Fodor 
1983), as well as cases when the resulting mental states are nonveridical, 
leading to illusions of understanding (e.g. Azzouni 2013), may be taken to 
suggest that such mental states are interestingly similar to paradigm per­
ceptual experiences (for discussion, see Azzouni 2013; Dodd 2014; Fricker 
2003; Hunter 1998; O'Callaghan 2011; Prinz 2011).
The question of whether we can hear meanings, or whether there is 
something like semantic perception, have been much debated. The 
view that we can, in some sense, perceive meanings (or meaning proper­
ties) has been criticized on various grounds. For example, Casey O'Calla­
ghan (2011) provides different versions of the homophones argument that 
aim to undermine contrast cases used in support for the view that we can 
perceive meanings, by illustrating that semantic properties need not 
always influence phenomenology and that contrast cases may be 
better explained by factors other than perceiving meaning properties

(for discussion see Brogaard 2018). Brogaard (2018) defends a version of 
the view that we can perceive meanings by arguing that auditory experi­
ences of meaning are the result of extensive top-down influences of back­
ground context information. According to Brogaard, such top-down 
influences rely on cognitive processes that can affect the function of 
the perceptual system via attentional processes. Cognitive processes 
can influence the perceptual system in childhood by altering pruning 
processes and leading to a difference in perceptual function. According 
to Brogaard, experiences of understanding utterances are appearances 
and serve as immediate justifiers for our knowledge about what was 
said. This is supported by the fact that such experiences are evidence 
resistant, i.e. they persist in the presence of defeaters, e.g. as in the 
case of misheard lyrics. On Brogaard's view (2018), utterance understand­
ing is perceptual, and not inferential in the sense of conscious inference.10
There has been a growing interest in different types of evidence that 
can be brought to bear on the question of whether we can perceive 
meanings (e.g. Drożdżowicz 2023). Luca Gasparri and Miguel Murez 
(2021) argue that the view that we can perceive meanings, as defended 
by Brogaard (2018), cannot be upheld, given that utterance meaning is 
massively context-sensitive. On their view, such context-sensitivity 
requires cognitive inference, which, they argue, cannot be accounted 
for by top-down processes discussed in Brogaard (2018). In another 
paper, Brogaard (2020) discusses several strands of empirical evidence 
concerning the evidence insensitivity of utterance comprehension, the 
Stroop effect, semantic priming, pop-out and adaptation (for presentation 
and discussion see Gross 2024). She argues that they may be taken to 
support a version of the semantic perceptual view. Fabrizio Calzavarini 
(2023) also discusses whether there is convincing empirical evidence in 
support of the semantic perceptual view. He argues that the relevant 
behavioral and cognitive data, as well as data concerning neurological 
disorders, do not conclusively support the view, whereas neuroanatomi­
cal data concerning brain areas and networks that underlie language 
comprehension, he suggests, strongly undermines it.
This special issue provides two new contributions to this debate. 
Steven Gross (2024) notes that the question of whether there is semantic 
perception has potentially important upshots for the debate about the 
admissible contents of perception and recent attempts to apply results 
from perception science to identify the divide between perception and

cognition. Gross discusses empirical evidence presented in Brogaard 
(2020) in support of the view that we can perceive meanings. He 
argues that empirical research concerning the evidence insensitivity of 
utterance comprehension, the Stroop effect and semantic priming does 
not allow for drawing conclusions about whether utterance comprehen­
sion involves perception or rather merely perception-based states, and 
thus cannot support semantic perception. On the other hand, Gross pro­
poses that although the arguments for the semantic perception that 
concern pop-out and adaptation could allow us to draw such conclusions, 
they are nevertheless not well supported by empirical research. He closes 
by considering non-inferential transitions from perceptual to conceptual 
representations. Such processes may be operative in cases of utterance 
comprehension, as well as in other cases at the border of perception 
and cognition, Gross suggests.
A different approach is taken by Elvira Di Bona (2023, this issue), who 
argues against the view that we can hear meanings by focusing on one 
type of auditory illusion. Di Bona investigates the auditory illusion of con­
tinuity, a phenomenon in which we are able to hear a sound as continu­
ous even though it has been masked by another sound. She argues that 
this phenomenon seems to have a perceptual nature when it occurs in 
the context of everyday sounds, or environmental sounds (e.g. the 
sound of the slamming of a door). On the other hand, the phenomenon 
seems to have a cognitive nature when it occurs in the context of speech 
sounds. The proposed analysis draws on Bregman's work on auditory per­
ception (Bregman 1990). Di Bona argues that these observations are 
theoretically interesting for two reasons. First, they illustrate that the audi­
tory illusion of continuity encompasses distinct phenomena that require 
different approaches. Second, they suggest that while everyday sounds 
can be auditorily perceived, speech sounds and semantic properties 
cannot. The latter result, Di Bona proposes, constitutes a new argument 
for the view that we do not hear semantic properties.
3.2. Inference and linguistic understanding
What is the role of inference in the process of utterance comprehension? 
Is inference involved in linguistic understanding? If so, what kind of infer­
ence? These questions have received increasingly more attention in phil­
osophy and pragmatics. An intrinsic difficulty lies in defining what 
inference is, which, as Gross observes (2024) is much debated and notor­
iously difficult to pin down. Inference can be characterized in various ways 
14 
A. DROŻDŻOWICZ AND K. P. PHILLIPS

(e.g. Boghossian 2014; Malmgren 2018; Neta 2013; Quilty-Dunn and Man­
delbaum 2018). Moreover, inference can take many forms (see Nes and 
Chan 2020 for recent work on various types of conscious and unconscious 
inference).
In the context of linguistic understanding, the role of conscious reason­
ing and consciously accessible inferences, in particular, has been dis­
cussed. Jason Stanley (2005) claims that 'the interpretation of context- 
sensitive expressions is obviously and non-controversially guided via con­
sciously accessible inferences from background beliefs' (132, nt. 1). Bro­
gaard (2020) focuses on Valaris' (2017) definition of reasoning as 
referring to processes performed by entities that at least sometimes are 
(phenomenally) conscious in the sense of having (phenomenally) con­
scious mental states, whereby transitioning between mental states in 
the process of reasoning is consciously accessible. In her (2018) paper, 
Brogaard describes the inferential view of language comprehension as 
follows: 'we hear a speaker's utterance and infer (likely unconsciously 
but not necessarily on a subpersonal level) what was said, drawing on 
our competence in the syntax and semantics of the language together 
with background information' (2968). Thus, initially, at least, the nature 
of linguistic understanding can be characterized as inferential in the 
sense of consciously accessible or personal-level inference. Brogaard 
(2018, 2020) argues against the inferential view so described and for a 
version of the semantic perceptual view (see 3.1. above).
Consciously accessible inferences may be especially apt to characterize 
cases of reflective linguistic understanding that involve deliberation and/ 
or rational reconstruction (see section 2.1, also Gross 2024, 21). But it is 
debatable whether and to what extent this type of inference (or reason­
ing) is a good candidate to characterize typical cases of unreflective, 
seamless linguistic understanding. The main reason for this is, as Gross 
observes, the notorious evidence sensitivity of utterance comprehension 
to contextual and background information (Gross 2024, 20-21; see also 
Allott 2023, this issue). In other words, it is fairly unlikely that in typical 
smooth cases of linguistic understanding interlocutors consciously 
reason about background information required for utterance interpret­
ation. An alternative possibility is briefly discussed in Gross (2024), who 
observes that the process involved in utterance understanding may be 
of an entirely different kind, i.e. non-perceptual and non-inferential, 
albeit sharing some features of perceptual processes in virtue of being 
stimulus-driven, fast, and nearly automatic. Brogaard (2020, 119) briefly 
discusses the possibility that utterance comprehension may involve 
INQUIRY 
15

type-1 cognitive processes, in which case grasping what a speaker 
appears to communicate would also be neither inferential nor perceptual.
One strand of the debate between the inferential approach and the 
perceptual approach has taken place within pragmatics and pragmati­
cally oriented philosophy of language. Proponents of Relevance 
Theory (Carston 2002, 2006; Sperber and Wilson 1995, 2004) have 
argued that the process which yields utterance understanding - a rep­
resentation of the speaker's meaning - is inferential: it takes beliefs 
about the context at hand and about the speaker as input, along 
with a representation of the utterance's semantic content, and yields 
a conclusion about what the speaker intended to communicate. The 
hearer must make such an inference, it is argued, because the semantic 
content of uttered sentences radically underdetermines the speaker's 
meaning. The gap is bridged by an inference on the part of the 
hearer, and so access to speaker meaning is inferential. François Reca­
nati (2002, 2004) and others (e.g. Mazzone 2011, 2018; Millikan 1984) 
have rejected this picture of the process which yields utterance under­
standing. While agreeing that semantic content underdetermines the 
speaker's meaning, Recanati argues that the gap is bridged by non- 
inferential processes. Such processes may rather be associative: they 
are sensitive to the broader context, but do not involve taking beliefs 
about the broader context as premises in an inference. They are sub- 
personal, in that they are not performed by the hearer, just like ordinary 
visual processing, according to Recanati. Inferential processes only come 
into play when the normal flow of language is interrupted (Millikan 
1984; Recanati 2002). Recanati argues that pragmatic inferences are 
not consciously accessible and so not inferential in a narrow sense, 
while allowing that they are inferential in a very broad sense, which 
allows that associative processes and perceptual processes are inferen­
tial. But are all narrowly inferential processes consciously accessible? 
Proponents of the inferentialist approach have argued that conscious 
accessibility is not the right criterion to use for determining whether 
a process is narrowly inferential (Carston 2002).
In this special issue, Nicholas Allott (2023, this issue) offers a new con­
tribution to this on-going debate. He sets a precondition for it: 
theories of utterance interpretation need to explain how the output of utter­
ance interpretation can be sensitive to practically any information. This shifts 
the burden against associationist views, if we accept that sensitivity to evidence 
is a hallmark of inferential processes. (13)
16 
A. DROŻDŻOWICZ AND K. P. PHILLIPS

Allott (2023, this issue) argues that utterance interpretation is a context- 
sensitive inference that is fully unencapsulated (i.e. depends on bringing 
together disparate information in reaching a conclusion). This claim is 
widely accepted, but rarely examined in detail, and faces strong prima 
facie objections and counterexamples. Pragmatic inference has some of 
the hallmarks of modular processes: it is mostly very fast and automatic, 
and there are persistent linguistic/semantic illusions. However, strong 
support for the claim comes from examples where arriving at interpret­
ation (and thereby understanding an utterance) requires information 
that is neither in the input nor proprietary to linguistic processing 
systems. Allott reviews such cases in detail and argues that this kind of 
evidence sensitivity and reliance on contextual information is character­
istic not only of arriving at the interpretation of implicatures, but also 
of the interpretation of the proposition expressed (or asserted) by the 
speaker of an utterance. He also examines the best-known linguistic illu­
sions and argues that they do not provide conclusive evidence of encap­
sulation of utterance interpretation as a whole. He draws the conclusion 
that pragmatic inference exemplifies a neglected category of inferential 
processes. Apart from informationally encapsulated unreflective pro­
cesses (e.g. perceptual processes) and informationally encapsulated 
reflective processes (e.g. some cognitive processes), there is a third cat­
egory: processes which are informationally unencapsulated, but spon­
taneous and fast. The latter is the type of inference that underwrites 
typical cases of unreflective, seamless utterance comprehension.
3.3. The states of linguistic understanding
How best to characterize states of linguistic understanding? And what 
kind of mental attitudes do they involve? As mentioned in section 2.1, 
there are multiple competing views, some of which characterize linguistic 
understanding as e.g. knowing (or entertaining) that the speaker said that 
P, as believing that P on the basis of the speaker's utterance, or as having 
a perceptual-like seeming or experience which represents an utterance as 
having a particular content and force. Which of these attitudes best cap­
tures the nature of the states of utterance understanding is a contested 
issue and subject of an ongoing debate (e.g. Grodniewicz 2021; Long­
worth 2018). In a recent paper, Grodniewicz (2022) suggests that 
instead of trying to identify the state of linguistic understanding with a 
single mental attitude towards a particular representation, we should 
characterize it as involving 'multiple interdependent representations', 
INQUIRY 
17

some of which may overlap with the mental attitudes postulated by the 
above views.11
Another question concerning the nature of states of utterance under­
standing is whether such states involve some way of representing an utter­
ance to mean such-and-such. On different representationalist views, 
cognitivist and perceptual alike, states of utterance understanding 
involve a kind of representing, in terms of, e.g. knowing, believing, or per­
ceiving that an utterance means such-and such. In this issue, Anders Nes 
(2022, this issue) discusses one objection to the representationalist views, 
namely, that they place stringent metasemantic demands on interlocutors 
to represent meanings as meanings. Young children of the age of three, for 
example, may not be able to meet these demands (e.g. Longworth 2018). 
But, intuitively, they seem to be able to comprehend meanings of utter­
ances in contexts. Through discussing relevant evidence from develope­
mental studies, Nes suggests that evidence of such limited capacities 
need not preclude that three-year-olds have a concept of meaning, given 
that it is not clear which meta-representational capacities and how rich a 
theory of mind infants have. It is also possible that three-year-olds may 
have some sort of proto-semantic concept (or a concept of proto- 
meaning). Finally, Nes proposes an alternative way of developing represen­
tationalism drawing on Davidson's paratactic view of indirect speech 
reports, which does not require conceptually representing utterances to 
mean such-and-such. Hence, representationalist accounts have a possible 
response to the claim that they demand too much of comprehenders.
4. The epistemology of utterance understanding
A further strand of the debate between inferentialist approaches and 
broadly perceptualist approaches has been concerned with epistemologi­
cal issues. Linguistic understanding does not merely play a causal role in 
giving rise to beliefs about others' communicative acts and to testimonial 
beliefs.12 It also plays an epistemological role: it provides at least some of 
the justification for such beliefs. Suppose Hibo tells Leon that Keir 
Stramer is the Labour leader. Leon justifiably forms the belief that Keir 
Starmer is the Labour leader on the basis of Hibo's say-so. Part of his 
11He proposes a pluralist view on which the representational structure of linguistic understanding con­
sists of three types of representations.
12An important strand of the debate about the epistemological role of utterance understanding has 
focused on the epistemology of testimony, taking its cue from Goldberg's point that 'The epistemology 
of comprehension seems to be a curious lacuna in the epistemology of testimony literature' (Goldberg 
2009, 596). See e.g. Peet (2016, 2018); Pollock (2023).
18 
A. DROŻDŻOWICZ AND K. P. PHILLIPS

justification for this belief derives from his understanding of Hibo's utter­
ance. He also forms a belief about the speech act Hibo performed: they 
said that Keir Starmer is the Labour leader. Part of his justification for this 
belief also derives from his understanding of their utterance. But exactly 
how does utterance understanding play this epistemological role? How 
does it provide justification? A variety of views have been offered. Some 
take the justification of beliefs about what is said to be inferential - their jus­
tification derives at least partly from further justified beliefs, e.g. about the 
meanings of words, about the context at hand, or about the broader world. 
Other views take justification for beliefs about what is said to derive not 
from other justified beliefs but from, e.g. perception-like experiences of 
understanding or the reliability of a certain kind of process, allowing for 
non-inferential justification. The central question at the heart of this 
debate, about whether linguistic understanding is epistemically inferential 
or non-inferential, relates to a set of broader questions about knowledge of 
language and knowledge of meaning. Alex Barber (2003, 2013) provides a 
helpful overview of debates about these broader questions. Here, we focus 
on the debate between inferentialist and perceptualist approaches to the 
epistemology of linguistic understanding, and the claims they make 
about the epistemic structure of utterance understanding.
On the one hand, there are views which take understanding to be epis­
temically non-inferential. First, there are views that model the epistemic 
role of utterance understanding on the epistemic role of perceptual 
states. One version of this view takes utterance understanding to just be 
a perceptual state, and adopts a preferred account of perceptual justifica­
tion to the particular case of understanding. A central proponent of this 
view is Brogaard (2018, 2020), who argues that utterance understanding 
involves perception of meaning properties and adopts a broadly dogmatist 
view of perceptual justification: Just as one's perceptual experience as of a 
red patch provides non-inferential justification for believing that there is a 
red patch through presenting the world as being that way, perceptual 
experiences as of someone e.g. asserting that P provides non-inferential 
justification for believing that that person asserted that P through present­
ing the world as being that way. One's justification for beliefs about what 
the speaker said does not rest on background beliefs about word meanings 
or about the context: these play a merely causal role.
Another version of this view does not claim that states of understand­
ing just are perceptual states, but rather claims that they are perception- 
like states or states of seeming with a presentational phenomenology 
similar to perceptual states (e.g. Fricker 2003; Hunter 1998; Pettit 2010). 
INQUIRY 
19

Given their presentational phenomenology, this view claims, states of 
understanding are capable of providing non-inferential justification for 
beliefs about what is said in a similar way to perceptual states or intellec­
tual seemings. As Fricker explains the view: 
I think that when we hear and understand speech we typically enjoy under­
standing experience: a quasi-perceptual representation of the content and 
force of the speech act; and that this grounds a hearer's knowledge of what 
speech act has been made. (2006, 610-611)
One's knowledge of language does not consist in knowledge of facts 
about meaning which then plays a role in supplying premises in an infer­
ence to a conclusion about what the speaker said. A similar view is 
defended by McDowell (1977, 1981, 1994), who argues that our capacity 
to understand language is a broadly perceptual capacity which supplies 
us with non-inferential knowledge of what speakers say.
A third version of this view also takes utterance understanding to be a 
perception-like state which is capable of providing non-inferential justifi­
cation for beliefs about what is said, but denies that this justification is 
provided in virtue of the state's presentational phenomenology (Burge 
2013; Graham 2010, 2015). Rather, such states are the output of properly 
functioning reliable mechanisms, and so a state which represents a 
speaker as having said that P and formed by such reliable mechanisms 
provides an epistemic basis for the belief that the speaker said that P.
A fourth version of the view claims that beliefs about what is said are 
justified in virtue of being the output of a reliable process of comprehen­
sion, and so adopts a broadly process reliabilist account of justification. In 
cases where the process does not take other beliefs as input, the justifica­
tion for the output belief is non-inferential: its justification does not rest 
on the justification for any further beliefs, but solely on the reliability of 
the process that gave rise to it (Goldberg 2007; Grodniewicz 2021).
A fifth version of the view claims that utterance understanding amounts 
to a first-order engagement with the proposition expressed by an utterance, 
which is the result of one's ability to engage in this way when one percep­
tually encounters utterances. The account then claims that understanding 
so construed can ground knowledge of what is said, so long as the 
subject possesses certain concepts, e.g. the concept say; has a reliable 
ability to apply them in judgments about what is said; and is able to exercise 
those abilities in accordance with epistemic standards (Longworth 2018). In 
cases where one's knowledge of what is said is grounded in such states of 
understanding, one's knowledge is non-inferential.
20 
A. DROŻDŻOWICZ AND K. P. PHILLIPS

On the other hand, there are views that deny that utterance under­
standing is epistemically non-inferential. Such views take one's justifica­
tion for beliefs about what is said to rest on one's justification for other 
beliefs, and one's knowledge about what is said to be grounded at least 
partly in other pieces of propositional knowledge. First, there are those 
who argue that one's knowledge of language, e.g. one's knowledge of 
the meaning of words, involves propositional knowledge, and that this 
knowledge serves as epistemic grounds for knowledge of what is said 
(e.g. Heck 1995, 2006; Hickman 2021; Lepore 1997; Stanley 2005; 
Weiss 2004). Second, there are those who focus on the epistemic role 
of background knowledge of facts about the world, and knowledge 
of facts about the context of the utterance. Bezuidenhout (2002, 117) 
suggests that the knowledge one relies on in utterance understanding 
includes 
(i) knowledge that has already been activated from the prior discourse 
context (if any)
(ii) knowledge that is available based on who one's conversational 
partner is and on what community memberships one shares with 
that person
(iii) knowledge that is available through observation of the mutual per­
ceptual environment
(iv) any stereotypical knowledge or scripts or frames that are associa­
tively triggered by accessing the semantic potential of any of the 
expressions currently being used
(v) knowledge of the purposes and abilities of one's conversational 
partner (e.g. whether the person is being deceitful or sincere, 
whether the person tends to verbosity or is a person of few words, etc.)
(vi) knowledge one has of the general principles governing conversa­
tional 
exchanges 
(perhaps 
including 
Grice's 
conversational 
maxims, culturally specific norms of politeness, etc.).
Bezuidenhout argues that such knowledge plays an epistemic role, and 
not merely a causal role (Bezuidenhout 1998; see also Peet 2018).
This special issue provides two new contributions to debates between 
epistemic inferentialists and epistemic non-inferentialists. In previous 
work, Brendan Balcerak Jackson has offered a critique of broadly percep­
tualist accounts of how we come to form justified beliefs about what is 
said: such accounts cannot account for certain cases of defeat (Balcerak 
Jackson 2019). In his paper in this special issue, Balcerak Jackson (2023, 
INQUIRY 
21

this issue) offers an inferentialist account of how we come to have 
justified beliefs about what is said. He takes the idea that hearers' knowl­
edge of the meaning of sentences forms part of the justificatory basis for 
such beliefs as a starting point, and then offers an account of what it is to 
know the meaning of a sentence. Balcerak Jackson rejects the idea that 
knowing the meaning of a sentence involves having theoretical knowl­
edge that the sentence has such-and-such a meaning, and argues that 
such knowledge instead should be understood in terms of inferential 
know-how. Knowledge of sentence meaning is a matter of knowing 
how to infer what is said by literal utterances of that sentence, directly 
on the basis of identifying that sentence as the sentence uttered. This 
view, he argues, provides the most plausible account of the epistemologi­
cal role of knowledge of sentence meaning. According to it, our under­
standing of utterances, where this is understood as justified beliefs 
about what the speaker said, relies on an inferential transition from the 
recognition of a certain sentence as having been uttered to a conclusion 
about what the speaker said grounded in the hearer's knowledge of how 
to make such transitions.
In her paper, Berit Brogaard (2024, this issue) provides a novel account 
of utterance understanding, with the aim of accounting for its rational 
roles, building on her previous defense of the idea that utterance under­
standing is a kind of experience that can provide non-inferential justifica­
tion for beliefs about what is said (Brogaard 2018). The account she 
proposes is developed against the background of a critique of the 
views of Dean Pettit (2002) and Brendan Balcerak Jackson (2023, this 
issue). In particular, Brogaard takes such views to be committed to unten­
able accounts of utterance understanding. Instead, she offers a pluralist 
account of utterance understanding. On the one hand, one can under­
stand an utterance in virtue of having an apt and undefeated experience 
of what is said by an utterance. On the other hand, another kind of utter­
ance understanding requires a judgment about what the speaker said. 
Either way, experiences of what is said by an utterance play a central 
rational role in utterance understanding: 
The undefeated aptness of an experience as of what is said by an utterance 
boosts its standing to that of experiential utterance understanding and the 
standing of a judgment properly based on the experience to that of doxastic 
utterance understanding. (27)
Brogaard also argues that this account can offer a response to objections 
raised against perceptualism in Balcerak Jackson (2019).

5. Concluding remarks
There is a growing philosophical interest in linguistic understanding, its nature 
and epistemology alike. Several different views in different strands of literature 
emphasize the role of perception and inference in understanding what was 
said on a given occasion. In this paper, we have introduced some of the 
main issues and debates concerning the role of perception and inference in lin­
guistic understanding and briefly presented the six papers that make up this 
special issue. The above presented debates span across various areas of 
research, including philosophy of mind and language, epistemology and prag­
matics. Despite this disciplinary variety, we believe that many of the issues dis­
cussed above can be fruitfully investigated together. We thus hope that by 
focusing on the role of perception and inference across different areas, this 
special issue may highlight some of the common threads in this area of 
research, and provide a basis for future work on this topic.
