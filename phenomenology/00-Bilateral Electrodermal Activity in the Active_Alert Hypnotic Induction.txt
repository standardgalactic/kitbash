Abstract: Shifts in hemispheric dominance were previously proposed
to play a role in hypnosis. Participants (N = 32) were exposed to an
active-alert hypnosis induction and a music-control condition while
electrodermal activity was registered bilaterally, providing informa-
tion on alterations in hemispheric dominance. The results suggest that
highly hypnotizable participants show a shift to right-sided and low
hypnotizable participants demonstrated a shift to left-sided electro-
dermal dominance in response to the induction, whereas no change in
laterality is present in the control condition. Additionally, the authors
found that self-reported hypnosis experiences were also associated
with a shift in laterality. These results underline the importance of
the shift to right hemispheric activity in hypnosis and underscore the
importance of hemispheric changes in shaping subjective experience.
Recent research into the neuropsychological correlates of hypnosis has
moved away from the dichotomy of the left and right hemispheres
toward implicating more specific areas of interest. Examples include
changes in functional connectivity among brain regions (Cojan et al.,
2009), more specifically, the decrease in frontal functional connectivity
(Cardeña, Jönsson, Terhune, & Marcusson-Clavertz, 2013) and the impli-
cation of the prefrontal cortex in hypnosis (McGeown, Mazzoni, Venneri,
& Kirsch, 2009). For recent reviews, see Landry, Lifshitz, and Raz (2017)
and Jensen and colleagues (2017). On the other hand, earlier the topic of

laterality enjoyed broad interest as several studies have confirmed the
role of the relative increases in right hemispheric activity during hypnosis
(Cikurel & Gruzelier, 1990; Edmonston & Moscovitz, 1990; Graham &
Pernicano, 1979; Gruzelier, Brow, Perry, Rhonder, & Thomas, 1984;
MacLeod-Morgan & Lack, 1982; Sackeim, Paulhus, & Weiman, 1979).
However, the contribution of the left side of the brain has also been
noted, as verbal processing of the hypnotic induction and subsequent
suggestions predominantly take place in the left hemisphere (Jasiukaitis,
Nouriani, & Spiegel, 1996). Focused attention, which is an important part
of the hypnotic induction, is generally related to left-sided processes as
well (Jasiukaitis, Nouriani, Hugdahl, & Spiegel, 1997). The changes
brought about by hypnosis are thought to involve a shift to right hemi-
spheric dominance either as a result of increased right or decreased left
hemispheric activation (Gruzelier et al., 1984). Our current understanding
of hypnosis in terms of laterality implies a complex interaction of the
hemispheres intervened with dynamical changes in the activation of the
left and right sides of the brain (Bob & Siroka, 2016).
A reliable method to measure changes in hemispheric dominance is
to measure electrodermal activity (EDA) bilaterally, (Hugdahl, 1984).
Cortical activity asserts an inhibitory influence on EDA, each hemi-
sphere controlling electrodermal activity of the contralateral side of the
body. Thus, when cortical activity increases in the right hemisphere
relative to the left, electrodermal activity becomes higher on the right
side of the body compared to the left side (Gruzelier, 1985). EDA has
been used extensively to assess the effect of hypnosis on the sympa-
thetic nervous system (SNS). Those studies finding a measurable effect
usually showed a down-regulation of the SNS during hypnosis (Bauer,
1980; Davis & Kantor, 1935; Kekecs, Szekely, & Varga, 2015), whereas
others found no effect (Edmonston & Pessin, 1966; Plapp, 1967; Stern,
Edmonston, & Ulett, 1963). Additionally, EDA also proved sensitive to
individual differences in hypnotizability; high hypnotizables displayed
higher EDA than medium, and low hypnotizables at baseline and
smaller reduction in their EDA levels at rest periods between cognitive
stress tasks (Jorgensen & Zacharia, 2002). However, most earlier studies
used unilateral EDA measurement only, disregarding the potential
discrepancies brought about by a shift in laterality during hypnosis.
Studies that did measure EDA bilaterally found that it provided useful
information related to hypnotic phenomenon. For example, high hyp-
notizables were found to have decreased information transfer between
hemispheres compared to low hypnotizables (Bob & Siroka, 2016).
Furthermore, a study that bilaterally measured skin conductance
orienting responses to standard tones found right-side dominance in
the amplitude of orienting responses during hypnosis (Gruzelier, 1985).
Because hypnosis is elicited by induction, it is reasonable to assume
that the proposed shift in hemispheric activity occurs, at least partially,

during the induction process. Therefore, the hypnotic induction pre-
sents itself as an excellent target for the investigation of EDA laterality
changes associated with hypnosis. One earlier study, measuring bilat-
eral EDA on 20 students and 10 cardiac patients, analyzed tonic bilat-
eral skin conductance during the induction and found higher, although
not significantly different, right-side EDA during the induction process
in both low and high hypnotizable subjects (Gruzelier, 1985). However,
the study did not look at changes in lateral dominance and employed
traditional hypnosis; thus, any results showing changes could be attrib-
uted to the effects of relaxation. A design that uses a nontraditional
hypnotic induction procedure such as active-alert hypnosis (Bányai &
Hilgard, 1976) could control for this factor.
Subjective experiences connected to the hypnotic state—such as loss of
sense of time, amnesia, and regression to childhood memories—are tra-
ditionally associated with right hemispheric processes (Gruzelier et al.,
1984). One may argue that a strong case could be presented for the
importance of laterality shift in hypnosis, if a link between peripheral
psychophysiological measures and subjective hypnotic experiences
would be demonstrated. There have been previous attempts to connect
EDA and subjective hypnotic experience. Tart in 1963 investigated the
correlation between self-reported subjective hypnotic depth and skin
conductance level and found a strong correlation between the two (Tart,
1963). Contrary to Tart's findings, Orne, while exploring the association
between EDA, self-reported hypnotic depth, and scores obtained on a
hypnotizability scale found no correlation between self-reported hypnotic
depth and EDA. (Orne & O'Connell, 1968). However, both of these studies
employed unilateral EDA measurement. Factoring in laterality informa-
tion might resolve these contradictory findings.
The present study aimed to assess shifts in hemispheric dominance
asserted by hypnosis, by focusing on laterality changes in electroder-
mal activity that take place during the active-alert hypnosis induction.
Furthermore, we aimed to fill a void in our knowledge by investigating
the
relationship
between
bilateral
EDA
changes
and
subjective
experience.
We hypothesized a shift in EDA laterality from left to right during
the hypnotic induction, which could be moderated by hypnotizabil-
ity. In order to explore the differential effects that can be found in
EDA across the sides of the body, we also planned to analyze
changes on the left and the right sides separately, and compare the
bilateral results. The investigation regarding the association between
EDA laterality and subjective hypnotic experience was exploratory,
with no specific hypotheses, although we expected that a shift
toward the right side may be related with experiences traditionally
associated with hypnosis.

METHODOLOGY
Participants
Participants were invited to take part in the study on a voluntary
basis and were not offered compensation. All of those who participated
had been involved in a standardized group hypnosis session before-
hand, in which their hypnotizability was measured with the Harvard
Group Scale of Hypnotizability, Form A (HGSHS:A, Shor & Orne, 1962;
Hungarian version: Költő, Gősi-Greguss, Varga, & Bányai, 2015). For
this study, we invited participants who fell in the lower (0-4) or the
upper end (8-12) range of the HGSHS:A. Exclusion criteria for the
study were self-reported present use of psychiatric drug, use of seda-
tives, or any psychiatric illness.
Design
Procedure. The study followed a within/between-subject mixed
design. After signing informed consent, participants were exposed to
two experimental conditions: hypnosis and a music control condition,
consecutively on the same day with at least 30 minutes of rest in
between. In the rest period, participants filled out psychological
questionnaires
regarding
their
experience,
of
which
only
the
Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI, Pekala, 1991) will
be reported here. Study conditions were presented in a random,
counterbalanced order.
In the hypnosis condition, a standard active-alert induction was
used (Bányai & Hilgard, 1976; Miller, Barabasz, & Barabasz, 1991),
with the test suggestions from the Waterloo-Stanford Group C stan-
dardized scale (Bowers, 1998) to measure hypnotizability. Suggestions
that require the use of both hands, moving hands, age regression, and
negative visual hallucination were omitted, as movements or opening
the eyes might alter EDA (for details, see Kekecs et al., 2015). The
results regarding the data gathered in the test suggestion phase will
be reported elsewhere. Although the induction was standardized, it
was delivered by different hypnotherapists; thus, induction length
varied between 7.5 and 9 minutes. Test suggestions were read by the
hypnotherapists to the participants in both hypnosis and music condi-
tions from a standardized script.
The music condition differed from the hypnosis condition only in
that the hypnotic induction and deinduction were replaced with music
containing a collection of carefully selected pieces differing in type to
control for preferences. The music pieces in place for the induction
(12 minutes) and deinduction (2 minutes) were approximately the
same length as the hypnotic induction and deinduction and have
been previously used in other experiments (Kekecs et al., 2015).

Instruments. The PCI measures subjective experiences in relation to
alterations in consciousness along 12 dimensions and 14 subdimensions
in 53 items. The Hungarian version of the PCI was used in this
experiment to assess phenomenological experiences (Szabó, 1989;
Varga, Jozsa, Bányai, Gosi-Greguss, & Kumar, 2001). The PCI has
adequate construct and discriminant validity for the assessment of
subjective states associated with hypnosis (Pekala, 1991).
Equipment. The active alert hypnosis sessions were held in a sound-
attenuated
chamber,
which
was
built
for
conducting
hypnosis
experiments in a silent environment. Electrodermal activity was
measured with OpenEDA, an open-source biomonitor with a four-
Hertz
sampling
rate
(Kekecs
et
al.,
2015).
For
electrodermal
measurements,
Skintact
FS-RG1
disposable
Ag/AgCl
electrodes
(Leonhard Lang GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria) were used with a solid
gel electrolyte. The disposable electrodes were placed on the left and
right shoulders of the participants (Van Dooren, De Vries, & Janssen,
2012). The shoulders were selected to measure EDA, as the design of
the experiment called for the movement of the dominant arm during
the test suggestion phase. The shoulders have been indicated as an
adequate spot for electrodermal assessment (Van Dooren et al., 2012).
Data Processing. Electrodermal activity was analyzed with Ledalab
3.4.9 (Benedek & Kaernbach, 2010). In order to decrease error noise, the
data was first smoothed with a Gaussian window. Afterward, skin
conductance
level
(SCL)
was
obtained
by
optimized
continues
decomposition analyses (Benedek & Kaernbach, 2010). Average SCL was
obtained for the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th minutes of the induction. To
determine the difference in bilateral skin conductance levels, the obtained
SCL data were transformed into a laterality coefficient (Schulter &
Papousek, 1992). The right SCL value was deducted from the left SCL
value, and the result was divided by the sum of left and right SCL. The
values of the calculated laterality coefficient range between 1 and −1.
Positive values indicate left electrodermal dominance, and negative
values indicate right electrodermal dominance. The shift in EDA laterality
was calculated by deducting the laterality coefficient measured in the 1st
minute from the laterality coefficient measured in the 7th minute. Thus,
positive values of shift in laterality mean a shift toward the left side.
Statistical
Analysis. To examine the difference in electrodermal
patterns in the two conditions for high and low hypnotizables
separately for the left and right side of the body, mixed ANOVA was
conducted using the within-subjects factors of time (1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th
minutes) and condition (hypnosis and music), and the between-subjects
factor of hypnotizability (high and low). The first 7 minutes of the
induction and the music control condition were analyzed for all
experiments, because we could be sure that this period was part of the

induction process in all sessions. The same mixed ANOVA was repeated
for the left and right side SCL as an outcome separately. The Spearman
correlation coefficient was used to explore the association between the
shift in laterality and the PCI subscales, because data were skewed.
RESULTS
There were 32 participants in the study (mean age = 29.51, SD = 9.74,
12 female). Five participants were dropped from the analysis for rea-
sons of electrode detachment or equipment malfunction. Additionally,
two participants who were enrolled as high hypnotizables based on
their group hypnotizability screening scored as low hypnotizable dur-
ing the active-alert hypnosis session, and thus were categorized as low
hypnotizables in terms of data analysis. One more participant was
dropped from the Spearman correlation for missing PCI scores.
The three-way mixed ANOVA conducted on SCL measured from the
left side of the body revealed a significant main effect of time, F
(3,24) = 4.525, p = .006 (see A and C of Figure 1). EDA levels rose most
prominently over time in the high hypnotizable group. However, there
were no other significant main effects or interactions. A three-way mixed
ANOVA was also conducted on the SCL measured from the right side of
the body (see B and D of Figure 1). Significant interaction between condi-
tion, time, and hypnotizability—F(3,24) = 3.38, p = .023—was found. At the
beginning of the induction, high hypnotizables showed lower skin con-
ductance on average than low hypnotizables. During induction, SCL values
of high hypnotizables rose considerably (see Figure 1B). On the other hand,
low hypnotizables initially had higher skin conductance than high hypno-
tizables, which remained unchanged during the induction. The pattern of
SCL changes is opposite in the music condition (see Figure 1D). In this
condition, low hypnotizables showed lower skin conductance compared to
high hypnotizables initially, whereas high hypnotizables had higher skin
conductance in the beginning, which displayed a downward tendency.
There were no other significant main effects or interactions.
Results showed a significant interaction of condition, time, and
hypnotizability on the laterality coefficient, F(3,24) = 3.00, p = .036.
High and low hypnotizable participants displayed different patterns
of laterality changes over time in the hypnosis and music condition
(Figure 2). In the first 5 minutes of the induction phase, the lateral
disposition of both high and low hypnotizables were balanced.
However, by the 7th minute high hypnotizables shifted toward right-
side dominance and low hypnotizables toward left-side dominance. On
the other hand, in the music condition, low hypnotizables displayed
clear left-side advantage from the beginning as opposed to high hyp-
notizables, who showed right-side dominance. These values were
unchanged throughout this condition (Figure 2B).
ELECTRODERMAL LATERALITY IN THE HYPNOTIC INDUCTION
287

To explore the relationship of the phenomenology of hypnosis with
the shift in laterality, subjective experience was characterized by the
PCI dimensions, and the laterality shift was measured by the difference
of laterality coefficient in the beginning and at the 7th minute of the
induction. Spearman correlation results between PCI and the lateral
shift are presented in Table 1. Significant correlations were found
between the lateral shift and several dimensions of the hypnotic experi-
ence in the induction phase. When laterality displayed a shift to the
right (laterality shift values are negative), participants rated their
altered experience, body image, perception, and altered state of aware-
ness with higher scores. At the same time, they scored low on self
awareness, rationality, volitional control, and memory. Importantly,
the music condition showed no significant correlation with any factors
of the PCI.

DISCUSSION
Our study aimed to investigate changes in laterality during hypnosis
induction by measuring electrodermal activity bilaterally during active-
alert hypnosis. We also explored the association of the shift in laterality with
subjective hypnosis experiences. According to our results, high hypnotiz-
ables display a shift to right-dominant lateral asymmetry during the induc-
tion, whereas low hypnotizables show a left-dominant shift in their
laterality. On the other hand, neither high nor low hypnotizables exhibit

laterality shifts in the music control condition. These results confirm that the
hypnotic induction affects low and high hypnotizable participants in dif-
ferent ways, and these differences translate to significant differences in EDA
laterality. Furthermore, we found that experiences that are usually asso-
ciated with hypnosis—such as altered state of awareness, alterations in
body image, and perception measured by the PCI—are associated with a
shift toward the right during the hypnosis induction. These results support
that hypnosis and hypnotic experiences are associated with a shift in hemi-
spheric dominance to the right. In addition, our results validate and call for
the use of bilateral EDA measures in hypnosis research.
The results revealed a significant difference in the pattern of EDA
laterality between conditions that was moderated by hypnotizability.
High hypnotizables showed a shift to right-side dominance, whereas low

hypnotizables demonstrated a shift to left-side dominance during the
induction but not the control condition. This shift in electrodermal dom-
inance toward the right side in high hypnotizables would imply a decrease
in left hemispheric activation. This is in line with the prevailing view of the
changes associated with the hypnotic induction—that is, high hypnotiz-
ables are claimed to demonstrate left frontal activation, which gives way to
right posterior dominance with left hemispheric inhibition (Gruzelier,
1996). On the other hand, evidence from neuropsychological tests show
that low hypnotizables often show the opposite pattern, and display left
hemispheric activation in response to the induction process (Gruzelier &
Warren, 1993). This left hemispheric activation would result in left-sided
electrodermal dominance. Our results, that low hypnotizables, as opposed
to high hypnotizables, react to the induction with left-sided electrodermal
dominance support this line of reasoning. Shift to left EDA dominance in
the induction in low hypnotizables may represent activation of left hemi-
spheric attentional networks. This activation is possibly produced by
repeated suggestions for focused attention and the verbal processing of
the hypnotic induction, which is also a contributing factor to left hemi-
spheric activation (Rainville et al., 1999). Low hypnotizables may be less
able to inhibit left hemispheric processes, which seems to be important in
inducing hypnosis among high hypnotizables. Contrary to low hypnotiz-
ables, high hypnotizables—who are suggested to have higher cognitive
flexibility (Crawford & Allen, 1983), which is further increased by the
induction process (Crawford, 1989, 2001)—may be able to shift from an
effortfully focused attentional style to a style in which focus is effortless,
and this effortless focus helps to get deeply absorbed in hypnosis
(Crawford, Brown, & Moon, 1993). The right hemispheric dominance,
indicated by the right shift in electrodermal activity observed in our
study, may be one of the mechanisms that allow for the deep absorption
in hypnosis and the effortless attentional focus of high hypnotizables
described by others.
Subjective experiences regarding the hypnosis session correlate with the
direction and amount of the shift in electrodermal laterality. Additionally,
out of the eight dimensions that were correlated with the shift in laterality,
seven have been found to correlate to hypnotic susceptibility in the past
(Varga et al., 2001). When a shift to right-side dominance occurs, partici-
pants undergo experiences traditionally associated with hypnosis, such as
an altered state of awareness or changes in their ability to recall events.
Specifically, the more substantial the shift toward the right side in electro-
dermal laterality during the induction, the higher the scores were for altered
experience, altered state of awareness, perception, and body image. When
activity increases in the left hemisphere, participants experience the oppo-
site to the hypnotic experience—that is, higher rationality, self-awareness,
volitional control, and memory. This further supports the view that changes
in hemispheric dominance play a crucial role in the hypnotic experience.
ELECTRODERMAL LATERALITY IN THE HYPNOTIC INDUCTION
291

It is worth noting that the PCI was completed in reference to the whole
hypnosis session, not just the induction period. This is important because
it implies that the first 7 minutes of the induction could predict the self-
reported experiences for the entire hypnosis period. Besides, the correla-
tion between the PCI and the electrodermal lateral shift during hypnosis
signifies the importance of the hypnotic induction. The fact that we did not
find the same correlation with subjective reports and laterality shift in the
music condition is in line with previous results that showed differences in
brain activity in the presence and absence of a hypnotic induction. For
example, a study found differences in the activation of the default mode
network after hypnotic induction in highly hypnotizable participants that
was not apparent in the condition without hypnotic induction (McGeown
et al., 2009). Participants in the present study responded similarly to
suggestions in both conditions, although to a lesser extent in the control
condition than in the hypnosis condition. However, their lateral EDA
changes in the control condition did not correlate with their subjective
experience. This is also consistent with previous research that described
high hypnotizable participants complying with suggestions without the
hypnotic induction but not showing the changes in brain activity that they
exhibited with the induction (Derbyshire, Whalley, & Oakley, 2009;
McGeown et al., 2009, 2012). This suggests that response to suggestions
in a waking state may not result in the same changes in the nervous system
as hypnosis with induction. It would be important to clarify whether the
relationship between changes in laterality and self-reported experiences
are unique to the induction process, or could possibly be brought about
with other methods, such as relaxation or meditation.
Limitations
Investigation of the role of laterality shift and self-report experiences
was exploratory in our study. Out of the 26 factors of the PCI, eight
correlated with electrodermal shift during the hypnotic induction.
Further replication is needed to confirm the relationship between sub-
jective experiences and laterality shift.
The emotional effects of music were not controlled for, and this also
may have introduced bias in EDA. In the future, a neutral control
condition that resembles the hypnotic induction in its narrative could
be used (for an example, see Varga, Kekecs, Myhre, & Józsa, 2017).
Furthermore, the use of a recorded induction would eliminate the
problems of the varying length of inductions.
CONCLUSION
Results indicate that low and high hypnotizables differ signifi-
cantly in the way their electrodermal laterality changes during the
active-alert induction. Lateral shifts in EDA were also found to be

associated with hypnotic experiences. Furthermore, our results also
highlight the importance of the hypnotic induction and its unique
role, which leads to altered EDA functioning. Findings provide
further evidence supporting the importance of laterality shift from
left to right in hypnosis, and the differences in laterality between high
and low hypnotizables. This is the first attempt to investigate correla-
tion between hypnotic experiences and electrodermal laterality. With
the advancement of technology, it is not inconceivable that research-
ers and clinicians could monitor electrodermal laterality in real time
to achieve better hypnosis results. This could be used to maximize
hypnotic depth and the extent of alteration in consciousness in
research and in clinical practice. Moreover, our findings underline
the importance of measuring EDA bilaterally in the research of the
psychophysiology of hypnosis.

ELECTRODERMAL LATERALITY IN THE HYPNOTIC INDUCTION

Bilaterale elektrodermale Aktivität in der Active-Alert Hypnoseinduktion
Krisztian Kasos, Zoltan Kekecs, Eniko Kasos, Anna Szekely, und Katalin
Varga
Abstract: Zzunächst wurde davon ausgegangen, daß Veränderungen in der
Hemisphärendominanz eine Rolle in der Hypnose spielen. Die Teilnehmer
(N = 32) wurden einer active-alert Hypnoseinduktion und einer Musik-
Kontroll-Situation ausgesetzt, während elektrodermale Aktivität bilateral auf-
gezeichnet
wurde,
um
Informationen
über
Veränderungen
in
der
Hemisphärendominanz zu sammeln. Die Resultate lassen vermuten, daß
hoch hypnotisierbare Teilnehmer eine Verlagerung zur rechten und niedrig-
hypnotisierbare Teilnehmer eine Verlagerung zur linken elektrodermalen
Dominanz als Reaktion auf die Induktion zeigen, während sich keinerlei
Veränderung in der Lateralisation in der Kontrollgruppe zeigte. Zusätzlich
fanden die Autoren heraus, daß selbstbeschriebene Hypnoseerfahrungen eben-
falls mit einer Verlagerung der Lateralisation assoziiert waren. Diese
Ergebnisse unterstreichen die Wichtigkeit der Verlagerung zur rechten
Hemisphärenaktivität während Hypnose und betonen die Bedeutung von
Veränderungen
in
den
Hemisphären
bei
der
Formung
subjektiver
Erfahrungen.

L'activité bilatérale électrodermale dans l'induction hypnotique active-alerte
Krisztian Kasos, Zoltan Kekecs, Eniko Kasos, Anna Szekely et Katalin Varga
Résumé: Il a été proposé par le passé que le transfert de dominance
hémisphérique jouait un rôle dans l'hypnose. Trente-deux participants
(N = 32) ont été exposés à une induction hypnotique active-alerte et à un groupe
témoin auquel on a demandé d'écouter de la musique pendant que l'activité
électrodermale était enregistrée sur le plan bilatéral, fournissant de l'informa-
tion sur l'altération de la dominance hémisphérique. Les résultats indiquent
que chez les participants très sensibles à l'hypnose, il se produit un passage vers
l'hémisphère droit en réponse à l'induction, et que chez les participants peu
sensibles à l'hypnose, la dominance électrodermique passe vers la gauche, alors
qu'on n'a observé aucun changement de latéralité dans le groupe témoin. Les
auteurs ont en outre constaté que des expériences d'hypnose autodéclarées
étaient également associées à un changement de latéralité. Ces résultats soulig-
nent l'importance du déplacement vers la droite de l'activité hémisphérique
pendant l'hypnose ainsi que l'importance des changements hémisphériques
dans la formation de l'expérience subjective.

Actividad electrodérmica bilateral en la inducción hipnótica activa-alerta.
Krisztian Kasos, Zoltan Kekecs, Eniko Kasos, Anna Szekely y Katalin Varga
Resumen: Anteriormente se había propuesto que los cambios en la domi-
nancia hemisférica jugaban un papel en la hipnosis. Se expuso a los partici-
pantes (N=32) a una inducción hipnótica activa-alerta y a una condición
control con música mientras la actividad electrodérmica se registraba bilater-
almente, proveyendo información sobre alteraciones en la dominancia
hemisférica. Los resultados sugieren que los participantes altamente hipno-
tizables muestran un cambio hacia el lado derecho mientras los participantes
poco hipnotizables mostraron un cambio a dominancia electrodérmica
izquierda como respuesta a la inducción, mientras que no se presentaron
cambios en lateralidad en la condición control. Adicionalmente, los autores
encontraron que los autoreportes de experiencias hipnóticas también se
asociaron con un cambio en lateralidad. Estos resultados subrayan la impor-
tancia del cambio hacia la actividad del hemisferio derecho en hipnosis y
enfatizan la importancia de los cambios hemisféricos en la conformación de
la experiencia subjetiva.
