Eagleman, 2009, p. 3). Similarly, the phenomenology of
spatial sequence synesthesia includes objects such as
tunnels, yet this contextual space appears as distinct
from the real world (Gould, Froese, Barrett, Ward, &
Seth,
in
preparation).
A
relative
poverty
of
counterfactuals
helps
to
explain
the
absence
of
objecthood in some forms of synesthesia, but by itself
it
cannot
explain
why
concurrents
are
always
experienced as non-veridical.
It is in this regard that an enactive account of
perception offers advantages. It does not need to
explain why veridical experiences appear as real on
the basis of their internal representations. Instead,
an object is experienced as real during veridical
perception precisely because that experience itself is
shaped directly by the real world (Beaton, 2013; Fish,
2009). This constitutes the phenomenology of its
observer-independence, its overﬂowing phenomenal
richness,
and
hence
its
open-ended
capacity
to
surprise us. Conversely, when experiencing an object
with which we are not directly in contact, i.e., which is
non-veridical, the phenomenology of its reality is
absent by default. An imaginary object's lack of
subjective veridicality does not require an additional
explanation.
To
be
sure,
delusions
of
doxastic
veridicality
regarding
non-veridical
experiences
demand a more complicated story, but, as Seth
acknowledges,
the
transition
to
the
latter
also
presents
an
interesting
challenge
to
predictive
processing.

Elusive phenomenology,
counterfactual awareness, and
presence without mastery

Abstract: Seth's counterfactual-based predictive processing
account of presence is compelling and innovative; it gives a
new, deeper understanding of a critical aspect of our
phenomenology. Remaining in overall agreement with Seth's
use of the prediction error minimization framework, I consider
the elusive concept of presence, I probe the exact role of
counterfactuals in the phenomenology of presence, and I
suggest that some aspects of sense of presence can be
accounted for by hierarchical inference without direct appeal
to predictive processing of sensorimotor contingencies.
Perceptual presence occurs when "veridical perceptual
scenes are world‐revealing" such that "they comprise a
world of objects rather than 'perspectival takes' on
objects."
In
spite
of
Seth's
excellent
examples,
explanations, and taxonomy, I confess I struggle
somewhat to pin down conﬁdently the phenomenology
of perceptual awareness of sensory attributes that are
strictly
unperceived.
For
example,
I
think
our
conception of presence would be helped by examples
where two experiences have identical content but one
has subjective veridicality (presence) and the other none
at all (and where doxastic veridicality doesn't explain any
difference). However, such examples do not seem readily
available. Another issue concerns the difference between
spatial presence (the back of the tomato), which invites
elements of action, and temporal presence (cf. the
specious
present,
with
protention
of
the
as
yet
unpresented tone), which seems far more passive.
Presence seems to be one of these familiar and critical,
but somewhat elusive, phenomenological concepts,
leaving it a difﬁcult target for analysis.

Seth reasonably conceptualizes presence in terms of
enactivism. He argues rightly that with mastery of
sensorimotor contingencies would come coding of a rich
counterfactualelement(whichisanathematoenactivism).
Presence is then underpinned by rich, explicit predictive
processing of what sensory input would be like were the
agent to move thus and so. Concurrents lack rich
counterfactuals so they lack presence.
The counterfactuals are sourced in the mechanism
for active inference but Seth gives them a role in
phenomenology. It is this move I'll now probe.
When counterfactuals become more precise than the
actual representation, then they begin to drive action.
However, actual action would change content rather
than presence so Seth stipulates that the counterfactuals
be fairly imprecise. But now presence begins to seem
somewhat
epiphenomenal:
World-revealing
phenomenology is an effect of counterfactuals that are
not yet strong enough to do their real job. It also appears
to have the counter-intuitive consequence that sense of
presence should be weak or absent for experiences
associated with strong, unambiguous SMC-predictions.
Seth's PPSMC is, however, resourceful: It can insist
on the subjunctive or prospective element, such that
counterfactual predictive processing is running "off-
line." This aligns presence with mechanisms for
imagery and action selection. The key question is then
how off-line prospective prediction enters awareness to
create the elusive phenomenology of presence. It can't be
as content nor as belief: Actual and counterfactual
predictions are contradictory so can't both determine
content,
and
doxastic
veridicality
(belief
that
prospective predictions are encoded) cannot engender
sufﬁciently
ﬁne-grained
subjective
presence.
In
response, one could say that presence arises as action
actually unfolds. Presence would then be associated with
increased gain on speciﬁc, high-precision expected
prediction errors in active inference; its phenomenology
would be shaped by increased openness to expected
precise input rather than by prospective coding of this
input itself. This would nicely parallel a natural
understanding of the specious present, and since
presence would be shaped "on the go" it becomes a
moving target, in line with its elusive phenomenology.
It is possible that PPSMC doesn't capture all aspects of
the elusive phenomenology of presence. It is therefore
worth revisiting a conception of presence without an
element of mastery, namely the PP account (sidelined by
Seth), on which presence is determined by representation
of invariants in perceptual hierarchical inference. Real
objects interact with each other and thereby cause non-
linear ﬂows of sensory input (e.g., occlusion). Hierarchical
inference, which convolves representations of higher-order
invariants, is necessary to predict such non-linear ﬂow, and
the implicit inversion of the model when prediction is
successful identiﬁes (deconvolves) these more invariant
causes. That is, relatively perspective independent causes
are revealed in the very process of prediction error
minimization (see Hohwy, 2013). This comes very close
to one conception of the sense of presence namely, that it is
world-revealing rather than merely perspectival. The lack
of presence for concurrents is then easily explained:
Concurrents are causes that do not interact on their own
with other causes (presumably a fence won't occlude a
concurrent). As such, concurrents produce a fairly linear
ﬂow of sensory input and no higher-order invariant is
needed to explain away their occurrence. This means
their inverted model is very shallow, and reveals nothing
much about the causal structure of the world—all of which
seems a good ﬁt for an absence of a sense of presence. This
PP account may help ﬁrm up our conception of presence:
An experience with presence and an experience without
presence can be identical in terms of the actual sensory
input predicted under the generative model at a given
moment, but different in terms of depth of the inverted
model.
The PP account mimics the "rich-poor" element of
Seth's PPSMC and they could potentially co-exist—
perhaps presence is modulated both "upstream" by
invariants and "downstream" by counterfactuals and
action.
