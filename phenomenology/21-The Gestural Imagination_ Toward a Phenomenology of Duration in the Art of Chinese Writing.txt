The Gestural Imagination: Toward a Phenomenology of Duration

Abstract
This essay represents a reflection on the nature of shufa, the Chinese "art of 
writing," and its ontological grounding as a continuous, "durational tran­
scription," of an inscriptional event, producing a phenomenology of "view­
ing." This distinguishes it from ordinary writing (xiezi) in which attention 
is focused on the lexical meaning of the written characters (i.e., an experi­
ence of "reading"). Viewing a calligraphic inscription actually unfolding in 
time (i.e., as a dynamical structure or "temporal object event"), however, 
raises an interesting theoretical question concerning the two complemen­
tary aspects of temporal consciousness of calligraphy as both duration and 
unity. This will be addressed in terms of recent discussions of a dynamical 
approach to Edmund Husserl's theory of time consciousness.
Keywords:	calligraphic inscription, shufu, xiezi, durational transcription, phenom­
enology of viewing, lexical meaning, logographic symbols, brushstrokes,

Chinese writing has a long and venerated tradition dating back over three thou­
sand years. The material structure of the medium of inscription and orthog­
raphy of Chinese characters, rather than remaining static, has continuously 
modified as a result of evolving needs, purposes, and imperatives: from oracular 
divination and ancestral veneration, to political commemoration and clerical 
administration, to social exchange and aesthetic appreciation, and most recent­
ly electronic communication.

There is today a general tendency to consider all forms of Chinese writing 
executed in the traditional medium of brush and ink as shufa 書法, a term tra­
ditionally used to denote the "art of writing."1 This, in my view, conflates the 
ordinary practice of writing Chinese characters (xiezi 寫字) with shufa (the "art 
of writing"). But precisely how does one distinguish Chinese writing as an aes­
thetic practice? 
This question is complicated by the fact that handwritten Chinese characters 
are ubiquitous in all aspects of the social life of the people, something that strikes 
the visitor no matter how many times he or she returns to China. The written 
character can be seen displayed as duilian or couplets on the walls of ancestral 
temples and the Imperial Palace in Beijing, as apotropaic and talismanic inscrip­
tions pasted on the doors of peasant homes, as poetic scrolls viewed within schol­
ars' studios, as signage in the marketplace, and as commemorative inscriptions 
engraved on stone tablets and the cliffs of sacred mountains. Given the pervasive­
ness of writing across the entire spectrum of social spaces in China, the definition 
of its status as aesthetic object does not seem immediately self-evident. 
This essay represents a reflection on the nature of shufa and its ontological 
grounding as "durational transcription," producing a phenomenology of "view­
ing," and not simply "reading," that precedes explanations of aesthetic reception 
and practice. Shufa displays simultaneously two quite different cultural func­
tions, the potential for written communication and aesthetic visual expression; 
thus it distinguishes itself from the ordinary writing of characters (xiezi), in 
which attention is principally focused on a reading of the lexical meaning of the 
written character. 
At the core of an aesthetic reception of a calligraphic inscription is recogni­
tion of how the procedures of the calligrapher's medium of brush and ink, which 
have their own rhythms and formal unities of purpose, seem distinct from the 
characters they inscribe and at the same time embody them. This is especially 
true where the writer introduces, through the relative intensity of touch in the 
angle of attack, subtle movements and tonal pressures of the brush, formal com­
plexities that serve to retard the reading process, precisely to elicit attention to 
the very form of the inscribed characters for aesthetic and expressive effect. In 
contrast to the Roman alphabet, the characters that comprise the written sys­
tem of the Chinese language are uniquely configured as logographic symbols so 
as to lend themselves to creative visual elaboration in the inscription of a text.2

Just as the figurative language of poetry, to quote Harold Bloom, is "a departure 
from the literal," the inscription of the character in shufa is a departure from the 
legible, so that its form is both "expressive and evocative" (Bloom, 1). 
Rather than defining shufa based on a material definition or authorial inten­
tion, we will look for a thick perceptual and cognitive description that might 
help in understanding the distinctiveness of this aesthetic mode of writing and 
its ontological grounding, thus presenting a nonessentialist definition that clar­
ifies its sensory or experiential differences from ordinary writing (xiezi), and 
which is also nuanced historically. We will initially approach these issues from 
the perspective of the inscription of a text, before turning to a consideration of 
their implications for its aesthetic reception. Only then will we be in a position 
to answer a fundamental question: What is it that we attend to in the aesthet­
ic reception and formal description of a calligraphic inscription, its aesthetic 
effect and expressive intent?  We will end with an examination of a passage from 
Lotus Under the Autumn Moon, a poetic inscription in cursive script, by the 
Ming scholar-painter and calligrapher Chen Shun (1483-1544), in the Jean­
ette Shambaugh Elliott Collection at Princeton.3
Calligraphy as a continuous durational transcription of an 
inscriptional event
Chinese calligraphy is an analog medium, the material basis of which is the tra­
ditional writing brush, an instrument that is highly responsive to the touch. In 
the inscription of the structured variety of characters in a calligraphic text, the 
writing brush has the remarkable capacity of registering the subtlest nuances of 
movement and accents of pressure as a direct and continuous transformation of 
the substance of ink. The result is a rhythmic sequence of brushstrokes perfectly 
isomorphic with the temporal duration of the originating inscriptional event. It 
is precisely this "durational isomorphism" that is central to our understanding 
of writing as a distinct form of aesthetic practice (i.e., shufa) in China. 
A calligraphic inscription may thus be defined as an analogical transcription 
Maryanne Wolf, professor of child development at Tufts University. "Unlike other writing 
systems (such as alphabets), Sumerian and Chinese show considerable involvement of the 
right hemisphere areas, known to contribute to the many spatial analysis requirements in 
logocentric symbols and also to more global types of processing." Wolf, Maryanne, Proust 
and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain (New York: Harper Perennial, 
2008), 35-36.

Of particular importance to this investigation are the roles of calligraphic memory, stylistic 
allusion, sensorimotor attention, and inference, as they relate to intent, in the aesthetic recep­
tion of a calligraphic text.

and indexical trace of its causal determinant, the originating gestural expression 
of the calligrapher in the wielding of the brush.4 Importantly, as an analogical 
transcription, a calligraphic inscription constitutes a specific kind of transcrip­
tion, one that is autographical and continuous within a given temporal dura­
tion (i.e., the time of the writing), thus forming a spatial record of duration in 
the indexical traces of ink.5 Each calligraphic unit in itself involves a temporally 
continuous isomorphic transcription of the formative process of its execution. 
In this respect, the art of calligraphy expresses our cultural desire to preserve an 
experience of time (once lived) in continuous duration—to conserve the past as 
well as to provoke memory of the genesis of the characters in an inscription and 
see their expressive intent as a singular historical event. 
Because the inscriptional act captures the expressive, autographic gesture in 
a time-bound process, now preserved as a spatial record of temporal duration 
in the visible traces of ink, the calligraphic image always refers to an invisible 
inscriptional event from which it is displaced in space and in time. As an analog 
transcription, calligraphy's mode of presence evokes, as it were, the specter of 
the gestural imagination of an authorial existence in a time now past, the absent 
causality of the autographic gesture of the calligrapher, across a seemingly "un­
bridgeable gulf in time." This dynamic of proximity and distanciation is tradi­
tionally referred to as shenhui 神會 ("communing with the spirit"), a quest for 
the created presences of the gestural imagination.
As a calligraphic inscription is a continuous isomorphic transcription and 
indexical trace of the formative process of its execution, the primary sense of 
this transcription is temporal. This durational isomorphism with respect to the 
inscription of characters accounts for calligraphy's conveyance of time in the 
rhythmic flow of brushstrokes as a continuous succession of discrete durations 
of movement; for, the continuity of autographic analogical causation is never 
broken. And yet there is something about Chinese calligraphy that has eluded, 
indeed, confounded, its Western viewers, who have generally failed to account 
for its distinctiveness as a time-bound spatial medium. This suggests a tendency 
in Occidental aesthetics that can perhaps be traced back to, in the words D.N. 
4.	
Writing this essay at this time is not without its ironies, for we live in social realities 
increasingly mediated by digital technologies. As digital processes come more and more 
to displace analogical modes of communication, space and time are no longer experienced 
as having continuity and duration once transcoded into the discrete bits of information or 
pixels of a simulated, composite "virtual reality," that is coded as "real."
5.	
This differs not only from the discontinuous trans-coding of contemporary digital media, 
but also from vinyl phonographic recordings, photographs, and celluloid films, which are 
automated analogical transcriptions.

Rodowick, "Gotthold Ephriam Lessing's 1766 distinction between the arts of 
succession or time [i.e., music and literature] and simultaneity or space [i.e., 
sculpture and painting], the former validated for its immateriality and thus 
presumed spirituality" (Rodowick, 13). To the gaze of the Western viewer, the 
spatial nature of a calligraphic inscription reflexively provokes a contemplation 
of the inscription from a vantage point outside the mobility of duration, a mis­
apprehension that arrests the flux of the phenomena, a perceptual faith that 
precedes, prefigures and obscures the perceptual experience of the phenomena 
as dynamic, mobile and alive.6 This quality also suggests that the perception of 
calligraphy, like other mental activity, is a dynamic process of organization, a 
cognitive construct of Gestalt formation, subject to but not always correspond­
ing with, the prevailing conditions of the visual field. 
The nature of calligraphy's ontological grounding as a durational transcrip­
tion, we may now conclude, is thus based on the logic of causality, through 
which indexicality is effected. Indexicality indicates a specific kind of causality, 
a transformation in a substance (e.g. ink) that is continuous and isomorphic 
within a given temporal duration. The inscription of a character is a process that 
evolves only in relation to the configurational force (shi 勢) it puts into play. 
To be true to the "inscriptional nature" of a calligraphic text (i.e., the text as a 
record of the formative process of its inscription) is thus to recognize internal 
unity as an emergent property of the temporal development and spatial unfold­
ing of the configurational force of the character formations in the process of 
aesthetic reception. The calligraphic inscription is thus a continual movement 
toward structure, which we experience at different stages of dynamic emer­
gence, and the meaning of the expressive gesture upon which its unity is based 
is in principle a "meaning in genesis" (Merleau-Ponty 1964, 69).
Time consciousness in the aesthetic reception of the 
art of  Chinese calligraphy
Viewing a calligraphic inscription actually unfolding in time (i.e., a "temporal 
object event"), however, raises an interesting theoretical question concerning 
the two complementary aspects of temporal consciousness of calligraphy as 
both duration and unity. What must be going on in our mind to make this time 
consciousness possible?7

The phenomenological structure of the inscription as given in perception (i.e., 
as a percept) and my awareness of it happen in time. If at any given moment in 
time I am just aware of the part or segment of the inscription being viewed now, 
that is to say, of the current momentary stage of the inscription, how can I ever 
be aware of the inscription as an integrated piece that takes place over time? 
When I am aware of an inscription as temporal, there is more to my aware­
ness than simply a succession of momentary awarenesses of momentary stages. 
When I view an inscription, I do not simply see this stroke or passage8 of an 
inscription now and another a moment later. That is to say, the constituent 
brushstrokes of an inscription are not simply contingently contiguous to one 
another. Something more is going on. They are internally, intentionally or 
meaningfully related to one another in what can be intuitively recognized as 
an immanent unity of the inscription. The sensible brushstrokes are the place 
where invisible threads of intentionality are captured in the visible.9
What we need, over and above the succession of momentary awarenesses, 
is an additional awareness of the inscription as composing a single temporally 
extending entity (i.e., as a temporal object). Edmund Husserl's theory of time 
consciousness addresses this very issue.10 Our perceptual time consciousness of 
the inscription as a whole, at the very moment of awareness of a particular pas­
sage, is three-fold: an impression of the immediate passage (e.g., a brushstroke 
in my immediate focal attention), retention of the previous passage, and proten­
tion (i.e., intimation or anticipation) of the next passage. 
The awareness of a given passage of an inscription by its very nature is directed 
upon the current momentary stage of the inscription as temporal object, but it 
is also the direct and immediate awareness of what has just past, of past stages 
of the temporal object. Protention, the anticipation of what is to come, is a 
qualitatively different experience than retention; it is an openness and antici­

nomenology: Issues in Contemporary Phenomenology and Cognitive Science, 245-265 and

I prefer the term "passage" as it captures the segment of an inscription as both nominative 
and as processual.

pation directed toward the future. That is to say, the passage of an inscription 
given in immediate awareness is always experienced within a "double-temporal 
horizon"—a horizon of that which is already past and a horizon that projects 
toward an intended next moment. These horizons are mobile, as this very 
moment, which is present (i.e., lived as such), continues to slip toward an 
immediate past; and it is in this very temporal dynamic that the affectual quali­
ties of an inscription and its potency as an expressive medium reside.
To illustrate this, we will examine a passage from Lotus Under the Autumn 
Moon, a seventeen-character meter poem, written in a free-flowing style of cur­
sive script (caoshu) by Chen Shen (1483-1544), in the Jeanette Shambaugh 
Elliott Collection at Princeton. The following is a translation: 
A bright autumn moon shines on the green waters,
On the Southern Lake [they] pick white duckweed.
The lovely lotus flowers seem to speak;
Melancholy overcomes the boatman. 
(Fu Shen et al., 274)
For the purposes of this study, I shall limit the focus of my discussion to the 
last three characters of the poem: "overcomes the boatman" (dang zhou ren 蕩
舟人). The character dang 蕩 ("overcomes") can be visually parsed into several 
segments, each indicative of a particular stage in the temporal development and 
spatial unfolding of the character. The initial segment is the "grass" radical 艸, 
here abbreviated as two staccato-like ink dots (dian 點). As we examine the 
first of the pair, to the lower left of center, it is possible to discern the path of the 
calligrapher's brush which, upon entering the dot, turns back upon itself in a 
counterclockwise motion, before lifting from the surface as it exits to the upper-
right. We are then able to imaginatively trace the trajectory of its movement as 
it crosses the implied central vertical axis of the column along an acute angle 
before setting down once again as it enters the second of the two dots.
The attention of our gaze here becomes immediately caught up in the pull of 
opposing dynamic of forces that define the visual interaction of the dots; each 
one appears to hold the other in check along a sharp incline to the upper right 
of center. The dynamic but precarious axial relationship encountered at this ini­
tial stage introduces a note of instability and emotional tension that effectively 
serves to propel us forward in a desire for visual and emotional resolution.
As the brush-tip exits the second dot, it traces an ever so tenuous thread of 
ink, a ligature that guides us along a precipitous leftward descent back across the 
implied central axis, and in a sharp reversal of movement, enters seamlessly into 
the first of a pair of broadly executed brushstrokes. The brush-tip now turns 
back on itself, briefly gathering momentum, before beginning its diagonal ver­

tical assent and descent. In a formal iteration, the emphatic counter-diagonal 
thrusts of these strokes mirror the counter-movements of the ink dots above. 
Forces generated through the momentum of their movements remain contained 
within the contours, as the brush, rather than directly exiting the second stroke, 
this time is pressed down and turns back in the "hidden-" or "concealed-tip" 
(cangfeng 藏鋒) technique. Then, as pressure on the brush is eased, it retraces 
its own path upward, before finally exiting to the right; then it immediately 
initiates a stepped progression of enfolding curvilinear brushstrokes: outward, 
inward, and finally downward. 
A delicate ink ligature now leads us on a gliding descent to the lower left 
before entering directly into the second of the three characters, zhou 舟, or 
"boat." The feeling of expansiveness experienced in the former character, now 
gives way to an unanticipated emotional constriction. After an initial, momen­
tary pause and "gathering of momentum," at a location along the central vertical 
axis of the column, the brush resumes its leftward-descent, when suddenly it 
makes an abrupt shift in a counter-diagonal movement to the lower right. Once 
again we encounter an abrupt reversal of movement, as the brush, briefly thrusts 
upward to the left before circling laterally along an incline to the right. The 
space enclosed within the boat-like shape of the character zhou is compressed by 
the tightly drawn brushstrokes, engendering a feeling of emotional constriction. 
The spatial interval that marks its separation from the third character affords a 
brief moment of repose in anticipation of the final movement and culmination 
of the character ensemble. 
Emotional release finally comes as we enter the last of the three characters, ren 
人, or "man." The brush now gradually regains its spirit momentum (shi 勢) and 
initially arcs to lower left, before twisting up and back around in a long, lateral 
curving movement that penetrates into the space of the adjoining column of 
characters. As we are about to make our final exit, a last retrospective glance to 
the upper-left enables us to recognize the formal necessity of this exaggerated 
elongation. What we discover is that it serves, in fact, to visually compensate 
for the axial imbalances we encountered above, effectively bringing about an 
internal state of visual stability and equilibrium within the entire ensemble of 
the characters. It is here that we are at last brought to emotional equanimity, 
formal resolution and visual closure. 
The internal structure of the mental acts involved in the perception of Chinese 
calligraphy happening in time is a special case of visual pattern recognition now 
conceived as a dynamic, emergent structure.11 It thus lends itself to a dynamical

model of cognitive processes and affectual response, an abstract account of the 
kind of dynamical mechanisms that might underpin time consciousness—an 
explanatory model based on dynamical systems theory.12 
Conceived as a dynamical structure, a previously experienced stage of a 
calligraphic inscription (e.g., the grass radical in the character dang) can be 
retained in the present precisely by making a difference to the current state of the 
inscription as experienced in momentary immediate awareness (e.g., the broad 
counter-diagonal strokes). The awareness of the current stage of the inscription 
factors in the past stage by changing in one particular direction rather than 
another, and it assumes that particular direction of change (for example, in the 
directional orientation, rhythmic flow and impulses of the strokes)  only because 
it happened to trace out the particular trajectory that was shaped by the prior 
inputs of movement and pressures to the brush. It is through this trajectory of 
change (e.g., the counter-diagonal mirroring of the counter-movements of the 
ink dots), in its difference from other possible paths of change, in the context 
of the intrinsic dynamics of the inscriptional structure, that the inscriptional 
structure retains a memory of its genesis and the past conditions our awareness 
of the current stage. In this kind of dynamical model, momentary awareness of 
a calligraphic inscription is essentially shaped by retention of the past and has 
the structure of a continuum.
How is protention or the future course of an inscription built in to our 
momentary awareness? A calligraphic inscription, by its very nature as a dynam­
ical structure, continues on a trajectory from any point within an inscription. 
The particular path it now follows (e.g., the stepped progression of enfolding 
curvilinear brushstrokes) is conditioned by the current state of the inscription 
in conjunction with its intrinsic dynamics. Thus, there is a real sense in which 
the calligraphic structure automatically builds in a past and future at every stage 
of the inscription and can thus become an essential aspect of current awareness. 
This time what is most relevant about the current state of the inscription is the 
ments to viewers' sensorimotor and proprioceptive imagination. (Proprioception relates to 
stimuli that are connected with one's internal sense of the position and movement of the 
body.) This can be attributed to the intertwining of three fundamental sensory modalities: 
vision, motility and touch (lending itself to a distributive model of cognitive and emotional 
processing). Each of the senses informs the others by virtue of their common project or 
concern with a certain endeavor and meaningful judgment. Any perceptual account of the 
aesthetic reception of a calligraphic inscription must therefore recognize that the act of 
viewing is a responsive performative human act, a "creative receptivity," thoroughly impli­
cated in the object perceived.

ways in which it conditions our anticipation or expectation of the future course 
of the trajectory of change. In this respect, protention is always suffused with 
affect, and an emotional tone accompanies the flow of the indeterminate about 
to manifest. And, herein lies shufa's distinct appeal to the affectual, as the force 
of the indeterminate and contingent is felt.
As Jean François Billeter felicitously stated, "We are moved by the movement 
that it unfolds within us" (205). And, it is precisely through our power to project 
on to inscriptions emotional states and feelings elicited by the affectual quali­
ties of inscriptions themselves that we give life to them, and experience them 
as expressive and evocative of sentiment and intent (i.e., "the seer and the seen 
condition one another"). Our challenge is to bring to words the visual experi­
ence and felt response of finding ourselves touched by the look of a calligraphic 
work, what the Greeks termed ekphrasis.
