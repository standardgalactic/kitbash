Teaching Phenomenology to Qualitative Researchers, Cognitive Scientists,  
and Phenomenologists 
 
by Shaun Gallagher and Denis Francesconi 
 
 
Abstract 
 
The authors examine several issues in teaching phenomenology (1) to advanced researchers who 
are doing qualitative research using phenomenological interview methods in disciplines such as 
psychology, nursing, or education, and (2) to advanced researchers in the cognitive 
neurosciences. In these contexts, the term "teaching" needs to be taken in a general and non-
didactic way. In the case of the first group, it involves guiding doctoral students in their 
conception and design of a qualitative methodology that is properly phenomenological. In the 
case of the second, it is more concerned with explaining the relevance of phenomenology to an 
audience of experimental scientists via conference presentations or published papers. In both 
cases, however, the challenge is to make clear to the relevant audience what phenomenology is 
and how it can relate to what they are doing. 
 
 
 
The teaching of phenomenology can take several 
forms. For example, in an undergraduate course on 
phenomenology it is possible to focus on the 
philosophical origins of phenomenology and its 
development across a number of authors. This 
approach contains many problems and issues for 
exploration. In studying Husserl's phenomenology, 
for example, we can note in his work the constant 
repetition of beginnings and re-statements about how 
to do phenomenology. The Cartesian approach gives 
way to the psychological approach, which gives way 
to the lifeworld concept. In this way, static 
phenomenology gives way to genetic pheno-
menology. It would also seem that a clear 
transcendentalism gives way, at various points, to an 
emphasis on embodied experience. In a graduate 
course one can pursue issues of Husserlian 
scholarship that demand close analysis of Husserl's 
texts. Alternatively, it is possible to focus on the early 
connections 
between 
analytic 
philosophy 
and 
phenomenology, and their later contentious divorce. 
One could wrestle with the various transformations 
that phenomenology undergoes in the existential 
writings of Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty. 
One could also trace the influence of phenomeno-
logical ideas through various post-phenomenological 
thinkers and movements such as Levinas, Derrida, 
and the postmoderns. In all of these approaches there 
is no shortage of controversial issues to explore. 
 
A different way to teach phenomenology is to focus 
on the phenomenological method and its applications. 
There is, of course, also some history involved here. 
However, the focus may be more pragmatic than 
scholarly. For example, one could explore phenomen-
ology by looking at its interdisciplinary uses. This 
could include the use of the phenomenological 
concepts of Alfred Schutz (1932/1967) in sociological 
analysis or the work of Roman Ingarden (1931/1973) 
on aesthetics and literature. Another possibility would 
be to trace the development of phenomenological 
psychology and the contemporary use of phenomeno-

logy in qualitative research. The focus could also be 
on the recent employment of phenomenology in the 
cognitive sciences, a combination that has given a 
boost 
to 
the 
currency 
of 
phenomenological 
philosophy. 
 
In this short paper we examine issues in regard to 
teaching phenomenology (1) to advanced researchers 
who are doing qualitative research using phenomeno-
logical interview methods in disciplines such as 
psychology, nursing, or education, and (2) to 
advanced researchers in the cognitive neurosciences. 
In these contexts, the term "teaching" needs to be 
taken in a very general and non-didactic way. In the 
case of the first group, what it involves is attempting 
to guide PhD students in their conception and design 
of a qualitative methodology that is properly 
phenomenological. In the case of the second group, it 
is more a matter of explaining the relevance of 
phenomenology to an audience of experimental 
scientists via conference presentations or published 
papers. In both cases, however, the challenge is to 
make 
clear 
to 
the 
relevant 
audience 
what 
phenomenology is and how it can relate to what they 
are doing.  
 
Phenomenology and Qualitative Research 
 
PhD students in psychology, education, nursing, 
business 
and 
other 
disciplines 
are 
frequently 
searching for good methods for doing qualitative 
research. They often come to phenomenology without 
any knowledge of phenomenological philosophy, or 
sometimes without any background in philosophy at 
all. One part of the task of teaching phenomenology is 
therefore to provide them with enough of a 
background so that they have a good understanding of 
some basic concepts, along with some of the technical 
terminology. In some cases, they get over-enthusiastic 
about using the technical terms and overdo it to the 
point of become obscure. It is important to cure them 
of this inclination. This kind of overuse and misuse of 
terminology is truly part of a bad practice that 
assumes that certain disciplines have solved all of the 
problems surrounding these concepts. It fails to 
recognize that there are often continuing disputes and 
debates about most of these concepts. 
 
Once they have some background and some sense of 
the concepts and issues, the primary question is how 
they can use phenomenology to do their research. 
This can take numerous forms, but one way is to work 
primarily with the process of the phenomenological 
interview. The research questions (in contrast to the 
interview questions) usually take the following forms:  
 
What effects does a certain intervention have 
on the lived experience of subjects? 
Do the changes in the lived experiences of the 
subjects reflect an improvement, and in what 
way?  
 
It is important to provide the students with a good 
understanding of what "lived experience" means and 
to help them devise a good set of interview questions 
that will access that lived experience. Students will 
often devise questions that ask the subjects about how 
they think of specific things in their life. These 
students equate the subjects' opinions or thoughts 
about their life with their  lived experience. This goes 
entirely against the spirit of the phenomenological 
epoché, which calls for a suspension, not only of the 
investigator's theories and pre-conceived opinions, 
but also of the subjects' theories and pre-conceived 
notions regarding their own lived experiences. What a 
subject thinks about something is not the same as his 
or her experience of that phenomenon. In the 
phenomenological court, so to speak, only certain 
things count as evidence, and theory, opinion, or 
hearsay are not accepted. An investigator needs to 
learn how to teach or lead his or her subjects to report 
their lived experiences. 
 
A researcher who was studying how certain physical 
practices shape people's lives, proposed the following 
question: 
 
Why did you think that coming to this training 
centre would resolve the issue? 
 
This question actually directs the subject away from 
his or her lived experience and asks instead for his or 
her opinion. In order to steer the researcher towards a 
more phenomenological inquiry, we suggested the 
following: 
 
At this point you might ask the subjects to 
describe what their experience around this 
issue was like. How did it make them feel? 
How pervasive was it in their life? Was it just 
a nagging issue in the background, or was it 
taking over their everyday experience? In what 
way? Can they provide an example? Was it 
purely an internal issue, or did it affect the way 
they experienced others, or the world? 
 
The researcher also included the following question:   
 
How do you feel that this issue has been 
addressed through the practices here? 
 
We suggested:  
 
Have the practices changed you? If so, can you 
describe that change, and can you give me an 
example from your everyday life of how this 
practice has changed you?

All of the questions were modified in this way. We 
were concerned about two things: firstly, accessing 
the subjects' experience rather than their thoughts 
about their experiences, and, secondly, accessing as 
much detail about their experiences as possible. In 
order to accomplish this, it is essential that the 
questions are phrased in such a way as to help the 
subjects to focus their answers on the faithful 
description of their experience. 
 
Our thinking about this kind of phenomenological 
interview has been influenced by Claire Petitmengin 
(2006, 2009) and the work of Depraz, Varela and 
Vermersch (2003). Petitmengin (2006, 2009) provides 
a set of clear and rigorous instructions regarding 
setting up the interview. She highlights the fact that, 
during the interview process, it is easy to drift away 
from the precise description of lived experience and 
to start providing reasons or theories about the 
experience. The task of the interviewer is to bring the 
subject back to the lived experience.   
 
Petitmengin's (2006, 2009) focus highlights an aspect 
of phenomenological interviewing that is not often 
mentioned. In reading Husserl or his commentators, it 
is possible to get the impression that performing the 
phenomenological reduction is a first step, and that 
once this step is taken we are suddenly in a different 
(transcendental) realm where we can proceed with the 
phenomenological work. However, it is important to 
recognize that the phenomenological reduction is a 
constant task that needs to be renewed throughout the 
research process. The researcher must work to stay 
within the phenomenological attitude (see Gallagher 
& Zahavi, 2008). 
 
Petitmengin (2006, 2009) provides extremely useful 
guidelines for the interviewer regarding the setting, 
and how to encourage the subject to pay attention to 
lived experience without introducing biases. The use 
of open questions - questions that do not include pre-
conceived concepts - is important in this regard. 
Instead of asking "Was this a painful experience?", 
the question should simply be "Can you tell me in 
some detail what was involved in this experience?" 
The interviewer can also help the subject simply by 
repeating her own words back to her. This process 
can result in clarifications being made. The subject 
can also be helped to identify and focus on a 
particular feeling, even if she does not have a word to 
express it, simply by providing a deictic reference to 
it, such as "this strange feeling you just mentioned".    
 
These are a few of the guidelines mentioned by 
Petitmengin (2006, 2009), building on the work of 
Natalie Depraz (2004) and Pierre Vermersch (1994). 
These interview techniques have been applied in 
specific studies of epilepsy by the Varela group in 
Paris.  
Phenomenology and Pedagogy 
 
Teachers, educators and researchers all conduct a 
form of practical work, namely teaching itself, which 
is directly related to ordinary life. In order to do this 
they require practical tools. It is also not possible to 
act from an educational point of view without having 
a theoretical framework that enlightens the pragmatic 
goals and ethical perspectives of the work. For more 
than half a century, phenomenology has maintained a 
stable and productive relationship with education 
(Tarozzi & Mortari, 2010), both in a theoretical and in 
a practical manner. There is a long tradition of 
"Phenomenological Pedagogy" or "Phenomenological 
Education" both in Europe and in North America. 
Within these approaches one finds interest in different 
roles that phenomenology can play in education and 
the social sciences in general. Most broadly, within 
Europe, phenomenology is generally viewed as a 
philosophy of research, while in the social sciences 
developed in North America phenomenology is 
mainly seen as an empirical approach aimed at 
exploring subjectivity and people's lived experience 
(Mortari & Tarozzi, 2010). 
 
This paper investigates some ways in which 
phenomenology can be useful to the educational field.  
It also investigates ways of teaching phenomenology 
to educators and educationists. We provide just a few 
suggestions about two main points that can be 
considered for teaching phenomenology to such 
groups, including PhD students in the education field. 
These two points concern, firstly, the awareness of 
one's own mind (taking care of the mind) (Mortari 
2002), and secondly, some strategies for planning 
research using a phenomenological method.  
 
Two points need to be mentioned in relation to the 
first concern: cultivating an awareness of our mental 
posture and the mental dynamics that are to be found 
in our experiential relationship with the world. Firstly, 
the essence of phenomenology is found in its practice. 
In this regard, the proper question is not "What is 
phenomenology?" but, instead, "How do we do 
phenomenology?". This question requires an answer 
on the pragmatic level. From an educational point of 
view, phenomenology should be seen as a way to 
educate our perspective on reality, to reflect on our 
relationship with the world, to change and refine our 
point of view, to build and define our mental posture, 
and to broaden the way we look at the world (Tarozzi 
& Mortari, 2010). Phenomenology should not be seen 
as a retreat into introspection that treats consciousness 
or experience as an isolated phenomenon. Instead, 
due to the fact that phenomenology emphasizes the 
intentionality of consciousness, it is about our 
relationship with the world. 
 
Secondly, because phenomenology 
focuses on

experience in-the-world, it puts the teacher in a 
position to recognize his or her own epistemic 
responsibility. It is of fundamental importance that 
teachers and students become aware of, and take 
responsibility for, their perspectives on the world. 
Phenomenology therefore offers teachers a way to 
reflectively take into regard their own points of view, 
and their own way of conducting their relationship 
with the things of the world. Within the relationship 
"consciousness-of-something", the subject has an 
ethical and noetic responsibility for his or her own 
role, a responsibility for the posture of his or her own 
mind. The mind, inevitably dynamic, depends on our 
self-awareness and knowledge, and the role of the 
subject in the knowing process is something that can 
be improved through taking care of the mind.  
 
In relation to strategies for educational research and 
the use of the phenomenological method in such 
research, it is important to consider the specific 
relationship between the scope of the experience 
under investigation and the scope of the question(s) 
used to investigate that experience. For example, if 
the topic under investigation is the subjective 
experience of wine tasting, or, alternatively, the role 
that drinking wine plays in the life of the subject, the 
appropriate time-span of experience needs to be 
considered. This includes determining whether it can 
be a short time-span of experience, as in the case of 
wine tasting, or whether a longer time-span is called 
for, as in the case of examining the effects of a life-
practice like drinking wine. 
 
Moving beyond the question of time-scale, it becomes 
clear that some cases require a focused and relatively 
structured inquiry on the specific experience, which 
may be sensory (as in the case of wine tasting), 
motor, emotional, or cognitive. Other cases (as in the 
examination of drinking practices) require an open 
question on the broader experience (for example: 
"Describe your personal experience with wine during 
your life"). The level of structure and complexity of 
these questions should be the object of discussion 
within the research group and should be directly 
related to the aims of the research.   
 
From a phenomenological point of view, there are 
other important issues concerning analysis of 
experience in the field or the re-creation of the 
experience in the laboratory. These issues include 
asking subjects to describe a specific experience 
immediately after the experience itself, or recalling 
past experience that may have been forgotten. 
Phenomenology can involve a mix of strategies 
related to the study design. For example, through 
focusing simply on factors that involve the temporal 
scope of the experience and the related scope of the 
interview question, it is possible, depending on our 
interests, to combine them in ways defined across 
four possibilities: (a) long-term experience and open 
question; (b) long-term experience and focused 
question; (c) short-term experience and open 
question; and (d) short-term experience and focused 
question. These strategies may help to reduce the 
"temporal distance" of the experience and allow the 
investigator to ask about something that is still 
present in the subject's mind (both in short-term and 
in middle-term memory). Such strategies allow 
researchers to manipulate the space for interpretation 
of the experience as well as for narrative practices 
that may improve phenomenological description. 
Some brief examples are provided below. 
 
Long-Term Experience/Open Question 
 
This strategy is typically used for the investigation of 
pathologies or diseases and their etiology, specifically 
concerning 
autobiographies. 
For 
example, 
this 
strategy could be used to investigate the experience of 
people who are alcohol-addicted in order to discover 
when, how and (possibly) why they started to drink in 
a pathological manner and the way in which they 
have lived with this pathology. This is the tradition of 
phenomenological psychiatry, and is derived from the 
Swiss psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger. In relation to 
education, the use of this combination can assist in 
understanding the pedagogical challenges involved in 
teaching pathological subjects, as well as providing a 
way in which to approach the study of wide-temporal 
experiences in the purely educational field. A good 
example of a phenomenological study of long-term 
temporal experience and open questions is the 
research conducted by Mortari and Sità (2010) 
concerning the relationship between professors and 
parents in schools. 
  
Long-Term Experience/Focused Question  
 
In the same way, it is possible to investigate a large 
temporal window of experience with a high degree of 
specificity by using a more structured question. A 
therapist, for example, may make use of the following 
prompt: "Think about your entire experience of 
alcohol use, and try to describe what happened only 
during those times when you were drinking at home 
with your children there with you but without their 
mother. Try to give as much detail as you can about 
those specific moments". Alternatively, in a purely 
educational 
context, 
the 
researcher 
might 
be 
interested in investigating the role played by some 
specific courses of study - for example, only the 
courses about north-east Italian red wines - on the 
entire wine-experience of the tasters. A specific 
course may have changed the student's ideas about 
wine partially or completely. Here the question could 
be: "Could you describe the effects of the wine course 
on red Italian wines on your general experience of 
wine?"

Short-Term Experience/Open Question 
 
This type of research is particularly difficult, as there 
is a risk that, based on a specific stimulus, the subject 
may start to create theories or thoughts that are not 
relevant with respect to the experience under analysis. 
However, this combination is often used in 
educational research on metacognition, where the 
researcher is interested in meaning-building or sense-
making about a specific and short experience or 
stimulus, such as a movie, a song, an art work, or a 
specific bodily movement. There is thus a well-
defined - spatially and temporally - experience, and 
the use of an open question therefore allows the 
subject to give a broader sense to his own experience 
with reference to his life. This strategy includes a 
phenomenological-hermeneutical research approach 
(see Van Manen, 1990, for a description of this 
approach in education research), where the subject's 
interpretation of the experience is more important 
than the description of the experience itself. For 
example, something as simple as a glass of wine can 
be an experience deep enough to produce a 
metacognitive effort aimed at creating a meaningful 
interpretation. In this example, the subject may be 
asked to talk not only about the experiential 
properties of the wine, but also about memories that 
emerge as a result of the taste or colour of the wine.   
 
Short-Term Experience/Focused Question  
 
The last combination is a good fit for experimental 
work within the cognitive sciences. In the cognitive 
sciences, the role of hic et nunc experience (such as 
visual perception of shapes, or aural perception of 
notes or songs) may be important, and researchers are 
sometimes interested in analyzing a precise stimulus 
with focused questions. For example, a research study 
could be designed to focus on a change in the 
immediate experience of wine tasting caused by 
taking a course for wine-tasters. The research can be 
conducted in either the field or a laboratory. Subjects 
may all be required to taste the same wine and 
immediately afterwards describe their own experience 
in a detailed way. In this case, the report may be 
focused more on the description of the experience 
than on its interpretation. If the experience is 
repeated, with subjects divided into groups based on 
whether or not they have taken a specific course, the 
question has to be the same for everyone and must be 
well-defined: "What precise tastes do you experience 
in this wine?" In this example, the wine experience 
for every subject has to be a short experience, and the 
question and the answer have to be focused on and 
restricted to the emergence of the experience, with the 
goal of discovering how the particular course has 
changed the experience of the wine.  
 
To conclude this section, it is necessary to underline 
the importance of a new approach to educational 
issues that can involve the phenomenological 
perspective, namely the dialogue between the 
education sciences and cognitive neuroscience 
(Fischer et al., 2007; Francesconi, 2009). Although 
this "mixed-area" is relatively new, it deserves further 
exploration by scholars of education sciences. 
Various important research centres are already 
investigating this field (e.g., the Harvard Graduate 
School of Education, the Teachers College at 
Columbia University, the School of Education at 
Cambridge University, and the Centre for Bio-
Education at the University of Naples), and scholars 
in the education sciences cannot ignore this research. 
The next section focuses on the way in which 
phenomenology may be integrated into this research.   
 
Phenomenology and Cognitive Science 
 
Francisco Varela (1996; Varela, Thompson, & Rosch 
1991) was one of the first researchers to suggest that 
phenomenological 
methods 
were 
of 
positive 
importance for empirical work in the cognitive 
sciences, and especially in experimental settings that 
involve neuroscience (see also Gallagher, 1997; 
Gallagher & Varela, 2003; Petitot, Varela, Pachoud, 
& Roy, 1999). Prior to that point, phenomenology 
was already being used for critical purposes in 
cognitive science in order to identify areas that 
cognitive science was unable to address (see e.g., 
Dreyfus, 1972; 1992). Varela's suggestion that 
phenomenology can play a more positive role in 
cognitive science research would necessitate a 
transformation not only of phenomenology but also of 
cognitive science. In order to achieve this aim, the 
conceptualization and application of phenomenology 
need to be taught to two very different audiences - to 
empirical scientists, and (perhaps surprisingly) to 
phenomenologists themselves. 
 
Teaching Phenomenology to Phenomenologists 
 
While teaching phenomenology to phenomenologists 
may sound both presumptuous and paradoxical, what 
is implied is that phenomenologists themselves have 
to be made aware of all of the various possibilities 
offered by phenomenology. Many phenomenological 
philosophers, for example, have been happy to let 
analytic philosophers of mind engage in the work of 
cognitive science, and to instead focus their own 
attention on the textual and historical scholarship of 
phenomenology. This latter work is vitally important, 
but it should not involve ruling out the actual 
application of phenomenology in various contexts, 
even if these contexts involve the transformation of 
phenomenology. One of the main issues in this regard 
concerns the naturalization of phenomenology, or 
exploring various ways in which phenomenology can 
be integrated with empirical science.

Husserl was well known for his critique of naturalism, 
and especially of positivistic, scientistic definitions of 
knowledge. However, Husserl was also concerned 
about providing a sound basis for doing science - and 
this includes empirical science. This is because 
scientists need to be conscious in order to do their 
work - they can only do their work by relying on 
what consciousness delivers to them - and therefore a 
science of consciousness (i.e. phenomenology) must 
be the first science, and it must be a transcendental,  
in other words non-empirical, science. Transcendental 
phenomenology was therefore defined in contrast to 
natural, empirical science. Doing transcendental 
phenomenology is clearly not the same thing as doing 
empirical science. However, "in contrast to" does not 
mean "in opposition to". Although Husserl was 
opposed to scientism, he was not opposed to science. 
Indeed, it would be a perversion to think that Husserl 
would not want the insights of phenomenology to be 
used in empirical investigations. Husserl (1931/1970) 
himself suggested that "every analysis or theory of 
transcendental 
phenomenology, 
including 
the 
transcendental theory of the constitution of an 
objective world - can be produced in the natural 
realm, when we give up the transcendental attitude" 
(§57). It is therefore feasible to suggest that, after 
pursuing the phenomenological and transcendental 
reductions, and working out our phenomenological 
insights, we can adopt a naturalistic attitude and take 
those insights into the empirical sciences to see how 
they play out. This last step should not be seen as 
"doing 
phenomenology", 
and 
phenomenologists 
should not object to it, given that it may lead to 
important applications of phenomenology.   
 
While some phenomenologists do not object to 
phenomenology's positive influence on the cognitive 
sciences as described above, they do resist the idea of 
what Varela termed "mutual constraints" (1996). 
Although phenomenology may be able to inform 
cognitive science, surely cognitive science cannot 
constrain phenomenology. For example, whatever I 
may learn about the brain, this cannot change the 
experience that I describe as a phenomenologist. This 
suggests that neuroscience can never improve 
phenomenology. Perhaps, if phenomenology were 
just pure description, then more knowledge about 
how the brain works would not help in the doing of 
phenomenology. However, phenomenology has never 
been just pure description. Both Husserl and Merleau-
Ponty (who is a good model of a phenomenologist 
who learned from the empirical sciences) always 
positioned 
their 
descriptions 
as 
informing 
a 
phenomenological philosophy that may include 
argument and theory, as well as description (see 
Gallagher & Zahavi, 2008).   
 
A phenomenologically informed philosophical claim 
may therefore be constrained by empirical science. 
The term "constraint" in this case does not necessarily 
have a negative connotation. Science can both 
confirm and question phenomenological insight.  For 
example, recent neurological discoveries about 
canonical neurons (neurons that are activated when I 
reach to pick up a tool and when I simply see the tool) 
in the premotor cortex can substantiate claims about 
kinaesthetic correlations of perception made by 
Husserl in his 1907 lectures on Ding und Raum 
[Thing and Space]. At the same time, science could 
place 
limits 
on 
the 
kinds 
of 
claims 
that 
phenomenologists would be able to make about the 
detail and exhaustiveness of their descriptions. For 
example, experiments on change blindness and 
inattentional blindness - respectively, the inability to 
notice changes that occur even when looking directly 
at the changing scene (Grimes, 1992), and the 
inability to see obvious things because we are 
attending to something else (Simons & Chabris, 
1999) - should make phenomenologists consider 
what they can and cannot claim about the scope of 
experience. It seems quite possible that I am in-the-
world, to use Heidegger's term, in ways that I cannot 
grasp solely through phenomenological insight.  
 
Teaching Phenomenology to Cognitive Scientists 
 
There are several ways that cognitive scientists can 
use phenomenology. These include the use of 
phenomenology to guide the construction of non-
representationalist models relevant for use in artificial 
research. In this respect, Dreyfus, Varela, and others 
have had some positive effect on AI, showing why 
computational models cannot work, and suggesting 
more embodied and dynamical approaches. The focus 
of this paper is, however, more specifically on how 
phenomenology can contribute to experimental design 
in behavioural and neuroscientific studies.    
 
One of the first tasks involves overcoming a serious 
misconception about phenomenology - that it is a 
purely subjective form of introspection. Dennett 
(1991, 2001) has misconstrued phenomenology in this 
way. Instead, it is important to explain to cognitive 
scientists that phenomenology actually provides a 
methodologically controlled alternative to simple 
reliance on introspective reports (see Gallagher & 
Overgaard, 2005; Noë, 2006). This is apparent in 
Varela's (1996) proposal, which he terms neuro-
phenomenology, and which involves using an explicit 
phenomenological 
method in the experimental 
situation.   
 
The classic example of a neurophenomenological 
experiment was conducted by the Varela group (Lutz, 
Lachaux, Martinerie, & Varela, 2002) when they 
trained subjects in phenomenological method in order 
to guide their reflections on lived experience during a 
perceptual task. The method involved three distinct

steps: (1) the epoché - setting aside preconceived 
ideas and theories; (2) the reduction - turning of 
attention towards the experience itself; and (3) 
intersubjective verification. Some of the steps 
outlined by Petitmengin (2006, 2009) were used to 
develop a set of "phenomenological clusters". Based 
on the subjects' own reports in response to open 
questions during pre-tests, the subjects generated their 
own vocabulary that the experimenters then used to 
define response categories for use during the main 
perceptual tasks. The phenomenological reports were 
then correlated with objective brain and behavioural 
measures that showed high correlations between 
specific brain dynamics, behavioural reaction times, 
and phenomenological reports on attention. This 
experiment demonstrated that cognitive scientists 
could learn something new (specifically about 
common subjective distractions that occur during 
experimental testing) by using phenomenology. 
Related experiments have been conducted regarding 
the lived experience associated with epileptic seizures 
(Petitmengin, 2010; Petitmengin, Navarro, & Le Van 
Quyen, 2007). 
 
Thus, Francisco Varela's (1996) conceptualization of 
neurophenomenology is a new tool that can be used 
by cognitive scientists in the study of perceptual 
consciousness. However, it is not necessarily a 
procedure that can be used to study non-conscious 
behaviour or certain pathologies that would prevent 
the subjects from learning or employing the 
phenomenological method. The notion of "front-
loading phenomenology" (Gallagher, 2003; Gallagher 
& Zahavi, 2008) may therefore be a useful alternative 
in other studies. In this research method, subjects do 
not have to learn phenomenological method, nor do 
they have to do phenomenology during the 
experiment. 
Rather, 
scientists 
make 
use 
of 
phenomenological insights and distinctions (either 
developed by phenomenologists, or developed during 
the course of neurophenomenological experiments) to 
inform their experimental design.   
 
One example of this can be found in a series of 
experiments on the neural correlates of the sense of 
agency (Chaminade & Decety, 2002; Farrer & Frith, 
2001; Farrer et al., 2003). These brain imaging studies 
employed a phenomenological distinction between 
sense of agency (SA), defined as the experience of 
causing or controlling an action, and sense of 
ownership (SO) for movement, defined as the sense 
that it is I or my body that is moving (Gallagher, 
2000). These two aspects of experience are 
differentiated on the basis of reflex or involuntary 
movements, such as when one is pushed from behind. 
In such cases, there is SO (a sense that it is my body 
moving), but there is no SA for the initial movement. 
The researchers designed various experimental tasks 
based on this distinction, such as asking subjects to 
control the movement of an icon on a computer 
screen. In some cases the subjects actually controlled 
the cursor, while in other cases they did not control 
the cursor. For example, a study by Farrer and Frith 
(2001) showed that SA correlated with activation in 
the anterior insula, an area responsible for the 
integration of a number of sensory-motor signals. 
This suggests that activation of the anterior insula is a 
neural correlate for SA.   
 
Mutual Enlightenment 
 
Another result of these experiments, however, may be 
of more interest to phenomenologists. The original 
context 
for 
developing 
the 
phenomenological 
distinction between SA and SO involved arriving at 
an explanation of schizophrenic delusions of control 
in which there is SO for the bodily movement, but no 
SA. In other words, these delusions involve a 
disruption of SA (which, at the neurological level, 
may involve a disruption of processes in the anterior 
insula). The way in which this problem was described 
in the literature on schizophrenia (see especially Frith, 
1992) led to the phenomenological distinction of SA 
and SO being framed in terms of motor control 
(Gallagher, 2000). However, Chaminade and Decety 
(2002) and Farrer and Frith (2002) introduced a 
different dimension of SA by focusing on the 
intentional aspect of an action. This concerns the 
sense that my action is making a difference in the 
world - for example, the sense that I control what 
happens on the computer screen. More generally, the 
experiments suggested that SA is connected to the 
effect our action has on the world - whether our goals 
or intentions are actually accomplished. This goes 
beyond thinking of SA simply in terms of motor 
control, and suggests that the phenomenology is more 
complex than portrayed by the initial SA/SO 
distinction.   
 
This research suggests two things regarding the issue 
of mutual constraints. Firstly, even if the original 
phenomenological description of SA and SO was 
adequate in the context of explaining delusions of 
control - or at least adequate to answering some 
specific questions about such delusions - the 
experiments, which were conducted in other contexts, 
suggest that perhaps the original phenomenology was 
not fully adequate to the phenomenon of agency. 
Secondly, and more generally, it suggests that 
phenomenological investigations may be constrained 
by the particular questions they attempt to answer. In 
this regard, the science seems capable of raising the 
same kinds of questions that hermeneutics raises with 
regard to phenomenology and the traditional claim of 
a presuppositionless method. Thus, in the example 
above, scientific experiments, even when starting 
with a phenomenological distinction, were able to 
offer a different insight into SA - namely, that it

includes not only motor control aspects, but also 
intentional aspects pertaining to accomplishing a goal. 
If this aspect was not included in the original 
phenomenological distinction, then the science should 
send us back to the phenomenological drawing board. 
In other words, this is a good example of how 
phenomenology can offer valuable insights to 
empirical science, and how empirical science can also 
suggest further phenomenological refinement. 
 
It would be possible to argue that the original 
phenomenological analysis was inadequate to begin 
with. This is indeed the case, and may be a result of 
the particular problem that was addressed. However, 
no phenomenologist can lay claim to a perfect or 
universally adequate phenomenological description. 
Empirical science can thus act as a constraint on the 
real practice of phenomenology. Stated more 
specifically, it is possible that empirical science can 
point to the inadequacy of a particular phenomen-
ological analysis. However, from a more positive 
perspective, this suggests that phenomenology and 
cognitive science can offer each other some mutual 
enlightenment (Gallagher, 1997).
