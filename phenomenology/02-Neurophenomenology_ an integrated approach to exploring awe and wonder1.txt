Astronauts often report experiences of awe and wonder while traveling in space. 
This paper addresses the question of whether awe and wonder can be scientifically 
investigated in a simulated space travel scenario using a neurophenomenological 
method. To answer this question, we created a mixed-reality simulation similar 
to the environment of the International Space Station. Portals opened to display 
simulations of Earth or Deep Space. However, the challenge still remained of how 
to best capture the resulting experience of participants. We could use psycholog-
ical methods, neuroscientific methods or philosophical methods. Each of these 
approaches offer many benefits, but each is also limited. Neurophenomenology 
capitalises on and integrates all three methods. We employed questionnaires 
from psychology, electroencephalography, electrocardiography, and functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy from neuroscience, and a phenomenological interview 
technique from philosophy. This neurophenomenological method enabled extensive 
insight in experiencers and non-experiencers of awe and wonder (AW) in a 
simulated space scenario that otherwise would not have been possible. Traditional 
empirical analyses were completed, followed by individual differences analyses 
using interview transcriptions paired with physiological responses. Experiencers of 
AW showed differences in theta and beta activity throughout the brain compared 
to non-experiencers. Questionnaires indicated that non-experiencers of AW gave 
more positive responses of religious and spiritual practices than experiencers of AW. 
Interviews showed that awe and wonder were more likely to occur when watching 
the simulated Earth view instead of the Deep Space view. Our study is a success-
ful example of neurophenomenology, a powerful and promising interdisciplinary 
approach for future studies of complex states of experience.

about space travel has traditionally focused on crew cohesion, medical repercussions and psychi-
atric implications, but examining the experience of being in space has been limited. Astronauts 
maintain journals throughout their missions. Some descriptions are more extensive than others 
due to mission duration (e.g. longer stays in space when on the International Space Station 
[ISS]), individual background, or personal reflection tendencies. The phenomena reported, at first 
glance, appear varied. A further evaluation reveals some experiences common to astronauts and 
cosmonauts. These experiences are that of awe and wonder (AW). Even though astronauts come 
from a variety of backgrounds, including military, engineering and science, the awesomeness of 
viewing Earth from a shuttle or gazing into the vastness of the universe from the ISS elicits states 
of AW. Going one step further, many astronauts report a paradigm of feeling that there must be 
something bigger out there, something holding everything together. Many astronauts have written 
about these deeply aesthetic, spiritual and religious experiences. Colonel Jeffrey Williams, who 
served as a consultant for our research team, wrote about these experiences in his book The Work 
of His Hands (Williams 2010). Our project sought to better understand and explain the experience 
of awe and of wonder, as well as investigate the relation of these experiences with religious and 
spiritual beliefs, within a space context. 
Approaches to studying experience
Throughout history, humans have been interested in understanding the exact nature of different 
experiential states. In psychology, a state is distinguished from a trait and is characterised as 
being temporary and dynamic based on varying internal and external factors (Chaplin et al. 1988). 
Psychologists, neuroscientists and philosophers have utilised different approaches to investigate 
experiential states, ranging from anxiety (Kendall et al. 1976, May 1977, Heller et al. 1997) to zen 
(Suzuki 1951, Berger 1962, Cahn & Polich 2006). 
Psychological methods for studying experiential states rely on self-report questionnaire data that 
are practical, easily quantifiable and easy to interpret. This method allows for large amounts of 
data to be collected and analysed in a timely manner (McDonald 2008). Despite these advantages, 
self-report questionnaires are subjective and can be influenced by the participants' willingness to 
participate, response biases, acquiescent responding, as well as extreme responding that can have 
a significant effect on the relaibility and validilty of these measures (Paulhus & Vazire 2007). 
Additionally, self-report state questionnaires are given after a stimulus is presented. Consequently, 
memory errors that cause skewed responses may occur due to factors that intervene between the 
stimulus presentation and the adminisitration of the questionnaire (Tourangeau 1999). Overall, 
self-report questionnaires are practical and are consistently used by researchers, but are limited due 
to the subjectivity of participant responses. 
Neuroscience methods for studying experience rely on psychophysiological systems that 
record metabolic and electrical signals from the body (Gevins et al. 1975, Wubbels et al. 2007). 
The majority of these systems have advantages of being objective, unobtrusive and continuous, 
allowing for signals to be processed in real-time (Dirican & Göktürk 2011). However, psycho-
physiological systems are subject to extraneous noise, temporal and spatial resolution limitations, 
and are difficult to interpret due to the large amount of dependent variables outputted per system 
(Dirican & Gokturk 2011). In general, psychophysiological systems are beneficial in that they are 
unbiased and objective, but the information that is collected is challenging to understand without 
other forms of data such as performance results. 
Phenomenological methods for studying experience in others rely on interviews that are 
used to evoke a description of an experience from the unique perspective of the individual 
(Dukes 1984). Phenomenological interviews benefit from being able to provide an in-depth 
understanding of an individual's experience that would be difficult to obtain from traditional 
self-report measures. Despite this advantage, phenomenological interviews are difficult and time 
consuming to analyse, not standard across participants, and are prone to the same limitations 
of other subjective self-report methods (Lester 1999). Overall, phenomenological interviews 
provide rich first-person data, but are limited due to the difficulty of analysis and subjectivity of 
participant responses.

Each methodology contributes to the understanding of various experiential states, but the 
individual impact of these contributions is restricted due to the nature and limitations of each 
approach. To overcome the limitations, the benefits of each method must be exploited. In the 
fields of neuroergonomics, augmented cognition, and applied neuroscience, solid steps are 
being taken in combining these disciplines. Neuroergonomics involves the use of physiolog-
ical measures to understand behaviour so that performance or cognitive states can be explained, 
predicted or improved (Parasuraman & Rizzo 2008). Research in augmented cognition aims 'to 
create revolutionary human-computer interactions that capitalize on recent advances in the field 
of neuroscience, cognitive science and computer science' (Schmorrow 2005: p. 441). In applied 
neuroscience, researchers study the optimisation of self-regulatory brain function through the 
integrated analysis of neural, cognitiv, and behavioural responses (Brendan 2011). All three of 
these mergers acknowledge the importance of assessment at different levels, but these multidi-
mensional approaches still only optimise on the benefits of psychological and neuroscientific 
methods. One approach to overcoming the limitations of each method is to integrate practices from 
psychology, neuroscience and phenomenology in interdisciplinary studies. Neurophenomenology 
is a promising approach based on this kind of integration (Varela 1996). Our project prescribed 
to the neurophenomenological method because it is an integrated and holistic approach for 
understanding and exploring experience.  
The moniker 'neurophenomenology' hints at its interdisciplinary nature. As the name implies, 
the approach merges aspects of phenomenology in the tradition of Husserl, Heidegger and 
Merleau-Ponty with the empirically supported data-collection techniques of neuroscience. The 
neurophenomenology described herein is a specific methodology, drawing from a history of 
successful and innovative studies. It derives from a scientific direction indicated by Francisco 
Varela (1996) and aims to bridge neurophysiological data and accounts of first-person experience.  
In brief, neurophenomenology is a study of mind, experience and consciousness that incorporates 
tools and techniques from neuroscience and psychology with phenomenologically derived first-
person data (Varela 1996). Traditionally, neurophenomenological research has relied heavily on the 
use of trained participants who could provide the first-person accounts only after extensive training 
in techniques of mental awareness and direction (cf. Lutz et al. 2002, Lutz & Thompson 2003). The 
present work is positioned to retain the features of neurophenomenology that merge the tools of 
psychology, phenomenology and neuroscience, but draw from a specific approach of neurophenom-
enology that collects data from untrained participants, an approach that has been used to improve 
treatment of epileptic patients (Le Van Quyen & Petitmengin 2002, Petitmengin 2010)more precisely 
here, in epileptology. A number of recent observations have indicated that epileptic seizures do not 
arise suddenly simply as the effect of random fluctuations of brain activity, but require a process of 
'pre-seizure' changes that start long before. This has been reported at two different levels of descrip-
tion: on the one hand, the epileptic patient often experiences some warning symptoms that precede 
seizures from several minutes to hours in the form of very specific lived events. On the other hand, 
the analyses of brain electrical activities have provided strong evidence that it is possible to detect 
a pre-seizure state in the neuronal dynamics several minutes before the electro-clinical onset of a 
seizure. We review here some of the ongoing work of our research group concerning seizure antici-
pation. In particular, we discuss experimental evidence of 'upward' (local-to-global.
As indicated above, the context for our project concerned experiences during space travel. 
Therefore, the first step of this project was to more clearly understand the experiences of 
astronauts. A hermeneutical analysis was conducted on the available astronaut journals. More 
detail of this analysis can be found in Gallagher et al. (in press). The important note is that two 
of the broader categories resulting were AW. Thus, AW were the primary focus for applying the 
neurophenomenological method. Awe and wonder were two broader categories that were defined 
by this analysis, and became the primary focus of our neurohphenomenological study.
Awe and wonder
Awe and wonder have been classified as emotions, ambiguous states associated with surprise 
and fear, as well as peak experiences that can be life transforming (Ekman 1992, Emmons 

Reinerman-Jones, Sollins, Gallagher and Janz

2005, Shiota et al. 2007). According to Keltner & Haidt (2003), awe requires perceived vastness 
and a need for accommodation. Perceived vastness is described as being an experience that is 
considered both powerful and moving (Keltner & Haidt 2003). This could relate to anything 
perceived as being larger than oneself, involving physical size, social status or other catego-
ries involving magnitude (Bonner & Friedman 2011). Furthermore, a need for accommodation 
is described as being the inability to incorporate an experience into current mental structures 
(Keltner & Haidt 2003). As a result, accommodation requires mental reorganisation in order to 
understand the experience (Bonner & Friedman 2011). Bulkeley (2002) describes wonder as 
being an abrupt decentring of the self when faced with a novel and powerful experience and a 
recentring of the self in response to new knowledge and understanding. Awe and wonder both 
require the experienced presence of something powerful and further cognitive processing to 
comprehend the experience. Such characterisations suggest that AW involve cognitive aspects 
and emotional ones. For purposes of the hermeneutical analysis and our study, we defined awe as 
a direct and initial feeling when faced with something incomprehensible or sublime. In contrast, 
we defined wonder as a more reflective feeling one has when unable to put things back into a 
familiar conceptual framework. This is consistent with Keltner & Haidt's (2003) concept of need 
for accommodation. In our view, awe motivates wonder, and wonder has the potential to change 
one's perspective on life. 
To date, few empirical studies of AW exist and the majority of studies investigating these 
experiences have been conducted within the contexts of religious, mystical, and medita-
tive experiences (Emmons 2005, Shiota et al. 2007). To examine AW, researchers have used a 
combination of phenomenological, psychological and neurobiological techniques. Early psycho-
logical and phenomenological contributions to the study of AW focused on theoretical classi-
fications of the experience (Bonner & Friedman 2011). These early classifications commonly 
linked religious and spiritual (RS) experiences with the experience of AW (Leuba 1912, James 
1922). More recent contributions showed associations between these experiences and a variety 
of personality traits (Shiota et al. 2006, 2007), therapeutic change (Elkins 2001, Schneider 2007) 
and different brain states (Cahn & Polich 2006, Mohandas 2008). 
According to Wood & Belzen (2005), meditation is a commonly reported trigger of experi-
ences that can be studied in the laboratory and as a result several researchers have used medita-
tion to investigate brain responses related to AW/RS. A variety of brain imaging techniques 
have been used to monitor brain activity during religious, spiritual, and awe inspired states 
including positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI). Several authors have found activation in the prefrontal cortex, frontal cortex, parietal 
cortex, temporal lobe, and limbic system during AW/RS states (Azari et al. 2001, Newberg et 
al. 2003, Muramoto 2004, Previc 2006). The anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsal prefrontal 
cortex were found to be activated during mindfulness and concentrative-based medita-
tion practices (Cahn & Polich 2006, Holzel et al. 2007, Ivanovski & Malhi 2007, Chiesa & 
Serretti 2010). The activation of these sites is attributed to the increased attentional focus, 
increased intentional effort and increased self-regulation required during meditation (Cahn & 
Polich 2006). Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIR), several authors have also 
found increased activation in the anterior prefrontal cortex, which is consistent with other 
neuroimaging studies (Cheng et al. 2010, Yu et al. 2011). Further linking the temporal lobe 
and limbic system to AW/RS experiences, electrical stimulation and seizures in the temporal 
lobe have been shown to evoke AW/RS experiences (Britton & Bootzin 2004, Devinsky & 
Lai 2008). In contrast, only weak correlations have been found between AW/RS behaviour 
and lesions to the temporal lobe (Muramoto 2004, Mohandas 2008). Additionally, hyperre-
ligiosity due to a temporal lobe epilepsy is considered rare and infrequent (approximately 2% 
occurrence rate; Ogata & Miyakawa 1998, Muramoto 2004). Despite the conflicting nature 
of these findings, there is some evidence that both the limbic system and frontal cortex may 
be involved in AW/RS experiences, with areas of the temporal cortex and limbic system 
indicating the emotional component of the experience, and the frontal cortex indicating the
attributional/cognitive component.

Investigating awe and wonder in a space environment
These findings in the literature provide some insight for our expectations in investigating AW 
using a neurophenomenological approach. However, the existing results might not match our 
findings as closely as anticipated because the majority of AW research has depended on medita-
tion to elicit states of AW. Our study sought to elicit AW through the experience of a simulated, 
mixed-reality space flight, which relies on an external visual stimulus to elicit feelings of AW. As 
a result, we might see significant changes in the occipital cortex as opposed to the frontal cortex 
due to the increased visual stimuli (Gevins et al. 1997). Due to the limited number of studies 
utilising this paradigm, the results should be considered exploratory in nature.  
However, the neurphenomenological approach used was expected to compensate for some of 
the exploratory nature of the physiological responses, as it enabled investigation of all levels 
of objective and subjective experiences of AW. Psychological methods were incorporated by 
administering questionnaires to assess the psychological traits and states associated with experi-
ences of AW. Neuroscience methods were used by connecting several sensors to participants 
to investigate the physiology behind the experiences of AW. Phenomenological methods were 
incorporated to identify participants feelings and thoughts experienced during the experimental 
scenarios. It was expected that (1) during states of AW there would be correlated physiolog-
ical metrics, (2) trait and state variables would differentiate between AW experiencers and 
non-experiencers identified from the interviews, and (3) a stimulating environment would 
influence feelings of AW.
Method
Participants
Eight males and 11 females (mean age = 20.94, SD = 3.73) were recruited using the University 
of Central Florida's Psychology SONA System website. Each participant was screened prior to 
the experimental task for handedness, colourblindness, nicotine and alcohol usage, decongestants, 
antidepressants, antipsychotics, Tylenol and similar medications. Participants were compensated 
with class credit.
Independent variable
A repeated measures design was employed to present participants an Earth view and a Deep Space 
(DS) view. In the Earth view, participants saw Earth and slowly traveled away until it looked like 
a blue marble. In the DS view, participants traveled through space while observing stars in the 
distance. Each view lasted 12 min to provide sufficient time for participants to reflect on what 
they were experiencing. Participants received both conditions, and the conditions were counter-
balanced and randomised across participants.

Dependent variables
Physiological measures were employed to capture quantified objective data of states. Advanced 
Brain Monitoring's ×10 electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) system 
(Figure 1) was used to measure electrical cortical activity, specifically alpha, beta, and theta wave 
responses, and to measure electrical activity of the heart, specifically heart rate (HR), heart rate 
variability (HRV), and inter-beat interval (IBI). 
Covidien's fNIR system (Figure 2) was used to record oxygenation of haemoglobin in the 
frontal lobe, and specifically left and right hemisphere oxygenation was recorded.
A variety of questionnaires were employed to capture quantified subjective data about traits and 
states. The Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness/Spirituality (BMMRS; Masters et 
al. 2009) was used to assess religious and spiritual traits. The Dundee Stress State Questionnaire 
(DSSQ; Helton 2004) was used to measure stress. The Levels of Self Concept Scale (Selenta & 
Lord 2005) was used to assess reflection or thoughts of oneself. The Mini-IPIP (Cooper et al. 
2010) was used to identify personality traits. The Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS; Tellegen & 
Atkinson 1974) was used to indicate the intensity with which one is immersed in an environment 
or task. The Multiple Stimulus Types Ambiguity Tolerance (MSTAT-I; Mclain 1993) was used 
to assess ones tolerance for ambiguity. The Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue; 
Petrides & Furnham 2006) was used to measure emotional intelligence traits.
Phenomenological interviews were employed to understand each participant's experi-
ence during the simulated space flight. Interviews covered various aspects of the partici-
pant's experience during the simulation including their level of attention, their thoughts and/
or feelings during their experience, and their bodily awareness before, during and after the 
simulation. The interview, using open-ended questions, was designed to allow participants 
to express their experiences in their own vocabulary (by following the method described 
by Petitmengin 2006) and to determine if participants had similar AW experiences to those 
described by astronauts.
Procedures
Participants were first asked to complete a restrictions checklist and the Ishihara colourblind-
ness test to determine study eligibility. The narrative provided to participants primed them to 
feel rushed before launch in order to effect a contrast with the subsequent calmness of observing 
space. Participants were not informed in the narrative that states of AW were being investigated. 
Participants entered the mixed-reality 'space capsule' (Figure 3) where the EEG, ECG and fNIR 
sensors were connected to the participant. 
After a five-minute resting baseline, participants completed the questionnaires. Participants 
then passively observed both the Earth and DS views. The sequences were presented in the 
Figure 3: The mixed-reality space capsule (left) and a workstation on the International Space Station (right).

mixed-reality environment that included simulated views through space shuttle portals. Once 
participants observed both views, the physiological sensors were detached and phenomenological 
interviews commenced. 
Results
The results immediately following treat the data in a very traditional psychophysiological or 
empirical approach, whereby all data is quantified for statistical analyses. Later analyses include 
a preliminary individual differences analysis of two interviews and correlations with the objective 
data and phenomenological interviews (Gallagher & Sørensen 2006).
Traditional analyses
Phenomenological interview 
The phenomenological interviews were scored according to the number of AW statements 
made by the participants during the interview. In other words, if a participant made a statement 
indicating awe or wonder, then he or she was considered to be an experiencer of awe or 
wonder. A one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was run to compare 
subjective reports of AW between the Earth and DS scenarios. Reports of awe (F(1,18) = 17.286, 
p = 0.001) and wonder (F(1,18) = 10.500, p = 0.005) were significantly higher during
the Earth scenario.
Physiological measures
A between-subjects ANOVA was run to compare physiological responses of AW among experi-
encers and non-experiencers during the space flight. During the Earth condition, higher levels 
of left hemisphere theta (F(1,18) = 5.048, p = 0.038) and right hemisphere theta (F(1,18) = 4.725, 
p = 0.044) were found among non-experiencers of awe compared to experiencers of awe. No 
significant effects were found during the DS condition. No significant differences were found 
among the ECG or fNIR responses. A repeated-measures ANOVA was run to compare Earth 
and DS conditions, with greater levels of frontal lobe beta (F(1,16) = 5.201, p = 0.037), occipital 
lobe beta (F(1,18) = 5.951, p = 0.025), left hemisphere beta (F(1,18) = 8.235, p = 0.010), and right 
hemisphere beta (F(1,18) = 5.177, p = 0.036) being found during the Earth condition. No significant 
differences were found among the ECG or fNIR responses. 
Psychological traits and states 
A between-subjects ANOVA was run to compare RS traits among experiencers and non-experi-
encers of AW during the simulated space flight. Higher levels of experiential comforting faith 
as indicated on the BMMRS (F(1,17) = 6.469, p = 0.021) were found among non-experiencers of 
awe (M = 12.14, SD = 3.43) compared to experiencers of awe (M = 22.75, SD = 10.60) during 
the Earth condition. In addition, higher frequency of private religious practices as indicated on 
the BMMRS (F(1,17) = 5.483, p = 0.027) were found among non-experiencers of awe (M = 14.86, 
SD = 5.39) compared to experiencers of awe (M = 20.58, SD = 4.73) during the Earth condition. 
No significant differences were found for the remaining BMMRS scales. No significant differ-
ences were found for wonder or the other questionnaires (DSSQ, Levels of Self Concept Scale, 
Mini-IPIP, TAS, MSTAT-I and TEIQue).  
Individual differences
The traditional analyses were limited, but they enabled us to identify experiencers and 
non-experiencers of AW. Additionally, we found that if participants experienced AW, it was 
most likely elicited from the Earth view, not the DS view. To better understand the unique-
ness of experiencers and non-experiencers, we selected two participants who experienced the 
Earth view to examine more closely. Participant 30 was an experiencer of AW and Participant 
25 was a non-experiencer of AW. The below excerpts from the phenomenological interviews 
and the EEG, ECG and fNIR responses are chronological according to their experience in the

Discussion
In order to identify physiological markers of AW, EEG, ECG and fNIR metrics were compared 
among AW experiencers and non-experiencers. Greater left hemisphere theta and right hemisphere 
theta were found among non-experiencers of awe compared to experiencers of awe during 
the Earth condition. Increases in widespread scalp theta have been interpreted as representing 
increased drowsiness and fatigue (Paus et al. 1997). In contrast, increases in frontal lobe theta 
have been interpreted as representing enhanced cognitive activity/working memory load (Gevins 
et al. 1997, Smith et al. 2001). Accordingly, higher activation across the left and right hemispheres 
as opposed to the frontal lobes in non-experiencers of awe during the Earth condition suggests 
that they experienced greater levels of drowsiness compared to experiencers of awe. According 
to Schacter (1977), participants who experience a drowsiness-related theta response also have a 
decreased awareness and ability to actively interact with the environment they are in. However, in 
order for an AW experience to occur, one's attention must be directed toward the stimuli (Shiota 
et al. 2007). As a result, the whole-scalp theta response can be used to differentiate between AW 
non-experiencers whose attention is not directed toward the stimuli from neutral and AW experi-
encers whose attention is directed toward the stimuli. 
This finding is also supported by reviewing excerpts of the interviews from an experiencer 
compared to a non-experiencer. However, the increased theta does not appear to be continuous. 
It seems that the non-experiencer is not engaged in viewing the virtual Earth very early in the 
simulation. The non-experiencer exhibited theta waves similar to the resting baseline throughout 
most of the Earth view, but this was following an initial intense increase in theta from baseline 
for the first 3.5 min. The experiencer mentions similar thoughts and feelings ('my mind starts to 
wander...[to thoughts about] my to do list'), but not until much later in the simulation. This later 
distraction or boredom reported by the experiencer is likely associated with the intense changes 
occurring in the physiological measures around the 8-10 min period for time spent viewing the 
Earth simulation. Theta waves show a spike from baseline at the 8 min mark with a sharp drop-off. 
This type of change is paralleled in oxygenated haemoglobin response and HR, HRV and IBI. 
However, it should be strongly cautioned that the changes in oxygenation were within 3% from

baseline, which is often considered natural variations and not stimulus induced or due to mental 
activation. These changes from resting baseline resemble a vigilance task. Operators in vigilance 
tasks are most frequently highly motivated individuals who find it difficult to maintain attention 
to the task over time and thus workload increases (Reinerman-Jones et al. 2011). The difference 
between experiencers and non-experiencers of AW might then also be a result of motivation and 
pre-existing expectations. The minute-by-minute analysis of the experiencer, however, is similar 
to trends reported in vigilance literature. Therefore, future studies of this nature should reduce 
the time on task when the visual modality is the primary input to the participant. This might not 
be relevant to environments outside of simulation or computers, but in those environments, it 
does seem important to reduce the task to 7 min or less to avoid vigilance-like physiological and 
self-report (interview) responses. 
The finding that beta is elevated from baseline during the Earth view indicates greater attention, 
alertness and arousal compared to the DS view (Prinzel et al. 2000). Frontal lobe beta does show 
significant changes from baseline, which is similar to responses seen in meditation-induced experi-
ences of AW. However, the beta changes in the occipital lobe and in the right and left hemispheres 
do indicate more visual, spatial and motion activation, which is perhaps a result of the perception 
of the Earth view compared to the DS view. These findings indicate that the Earth view is more 
engaging regardless of experiencing or not experiencing AW. The phenomenological scoring of 
AW results support this difference. More AW statements were made about the Earth view than the 
DS view. These findings indicate that participants had greater difficulty accommodating the Earth 
view into their current mental structures compared to the Deep Space view, which is consistent 
with Keltner and Haidt's (2003) model of AW. Therefore it is recommended that the details of this 
condition be examined more thoroughly and is also the reason that we looked at an experiencer 
and non-experiencer of AW in this condition. 
The experiencer of AW, Participant 30, showed greater variance in changes from baseline 
and these sharper changes occurred throughout the Earth view simulation compared with the 
non-experiencer, Participant 25. In addition, the experiencer had a greater immediate increase 
in beta activity compared to the non-experiencer. This difference in immediate beta increase 
was particularly prevalent in the frontal and occipital lobes. Therefore, the emotional and visual 
centres of the brain seem to be important players in experiencing AW.
To tease out the effect of emotion versus visual stimulus on experiencing AW, the alpha 
bandwidth should be considered. The lack of significant changes in alpha activity might actually 
be due to being blocked by activity, as is present by the beta waves. This alpha blocking is in 
contrast to common findings in meditators and thus supports the notion that the visual stimuli are 
likely leading to different responses than traditionally seen by meditation-induced AW experi-
ences. These findings suggest that information-rich and attention-grabbing environments are 
influential in AW experiences, which are consistent with findings from Shiota et al. (2007). 
Future research should consider the importance of the visuals and parse these from the rest of 
the environment. In other words, since we used a mixed-reality environment, it is difficult to 
discern the impact of the physical environment versus the visual stimuli. It is important to make 
this distinction in order to understand the impact of only the visual simulation (e.g. shown on a 
screen or monitor).    
The results discussed thus far indicate the importance of the simulated environment and visuals. 
However, the findings from the BMMRS raise the possibility that pre-existing beliefs influence 
experiencing AW. Two subscales of the BMMRS, Experiential Comforting Faith (ECF) and 
Private Religious Practices (PRP), were able to differentiate RS traits between AW experiencers 
and non-experiencers during the Earth view. The ECF subscale is comprised of religious items 
that identify an individual's religious feeling of connection with a higher power, such as 'I feel 
God's presence' and 'I believe in a God who watches over me' (Masters et al. 2009). In addition, 
the PRP subscale is comprised of items that tapped into an individual's prayer and medita-
tion practices, including 'How often do you read sacred texts or other religious literature' and 
'Within your religious or spiritual tradition, how often do you meditate?' (Masters et al. 2009). 
Awe non-experiencers were found to have higher levels of RS compared to awe experiencers.

Although awe experiences have been linked to RS factors (Emmons 2005, Newberg & Newberg 
2005), the present results show that space-related awe experiences can occur with the absence of 
RS factors. This finding corresponds with Keltner and Haidt's (2003) model of AW insofar as the 
two prerequisites of AW experiences, perceived vastness and accommodation, do not depend on 
the presence of RS factors. In addition, this is consistent with a statement made by one astronaut 
in his journal who said 'People who had a religious background expressed (awe) in religious 
terms, and people who didn't expressed (awe) in more humanitarian terms' (Lind, interviewed by 
White 1987: p. 272ff). 
Thus, future research should examine the differentiations between AW experience and religi-
osity. There are likely more fine-grained distinctions or subcategories worth analysing to better 
address this relationship. Specifically, our analyses from the phenomenological interviews, to 
date, focused on experiences of AW very broadly. The hermeneutical analysis of the astronauts' 
journals conducted by members of our research team (see Gallagher 2013) separated aesthetic, 
spiritual or religious experiences into 34 experiential categories, including feelings of connect-
edness, appreciation, fascination, physiological responses and surprise. Future analysis will be 
conducted using these more specific categories. 
The present paper illustrates the importance of a multidimensional, multidisciplinary approach 
to examining and understanding experience. Given that our experiment reflects certain limitations, 
recommendations have been made for moving forward with this line of work. The neurophenom-
enological method proved to be fruitful to exploring the experience or lack of experience of AW 
in a virtual space environment. New understanding has been brought forth with the work already 
completed. The traditional analyses provided a starting point to delve deeper into exploring 
individual differences. The individual differences, made clear by the phenomenological interviews, 
helped clarify the group findings of the traditional analyses. There is no doubt that neurophenom-
enology is a powerful approach to capturing multiple levels of objective and subjective factors that 
influence the experience of AW. Neurphenomenology promises to be a productive tool for future 
holistic experience explanation.
