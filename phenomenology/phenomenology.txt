### 00-An Education in Narratives

The article "An Education in Narratives" by Shaun Gallagher argues for the importance of narrative competency as a means to address issues in moral psychology and social cognition, particularly in relation to Aristotle's concept of phronesis (practical wisdom).

Gallagher begins by outlining Aristotle's view that phronesis involves not just general knowledge or rule-following but a form of experiential, contextualized knowledge. This understanding is developed through good upbringing and interaction with virtuous people, who serve as models for moral behavior. However, Gallagher points out that this approach can lead to a narrow, conservative ethics due to the mirror-like nature of friendships in Aristotle's theory, where each person reflects the virtues of the other.

Moving to contemporary issues in social cognition, Gallagher critiques simulation theory—the idea that we understand others by simulating their mental states within our own minds. He identifies two main problems with this approach: the starting problem (how do we know which simulation to run for a given situation?) and the diversity problem (why does simulation tend to favor in-group members over out-groups?).

To address these issues, Gallagher proposes an alternative based on narrative competency. According to this view, our understanding of others is not primarily based on simulating their mental states but rather on interpreting their actions within a broader context provided by narratives—stories, myths, and other forms of storytelling.

This narrative approach solves the starting problem because it provides a wealth of contextualized knowledge (what Gallagher calls a "massive hermeneutical background") derived from exposure to various narratives. This background allows us to recognize the relevance and meaning of others' actions more accurately than simulation alone would allow.

Regarding the diversity problem, the narrative approach posits that we understand and empathize with diverse others by gaining familiarity with their stories or situations through narratives. This is different from simulating mental states, which may unintentionally favor in-group members due to similarity bias.

Finally, Gallagher suggests that an education rich in diverse narratives can broaden our understanding of the good and cultivate phronesis more effectively than relying solely on our immediate social circles. Such an education would expose us to a wider range of perspectives, potentially countering the narrowing effects of growing up primarily with similar others.

However, Gallagher acknowledges that narratives can also be conservative and may reinforce existing power structures. Therefore, for this approach to work optimally, an educational system should value humanities, diversity, and critical narrative engagement to challenge established viewpoints.

In summary, Gallagher's article presents a compelling argument for the role of narratives in social cognition and moral development. By emphasizing the importance of diverse narratives over simulation, it offers a potential solution to issues like narrow ethics and diversity bias in our understanding of others.


### 00-Bilateral Electrodermal Activity in the Active_Alert Hypnotic Induction

Title: Bilateral Electrodermal Activity in the Active-Alert Hypnotic Induction

This study, published in the International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, investigates shifts in hemispheric dominance during hypnosis using bilateral electrodermal activity (EDA) measurements. The research was conducted by Krisztian Kasos, Zoltan Kekecs, Eniko Kasos, Anna Szekely, and Katalin Varga from Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary.

**Methodology:**

32 participants were recruited based on their hypnotizability scores from the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotizability (HGSHS:A). Exclusion criteria included current use of psychiatric drugs, sedative use, or any psychiatric illnesses. The study employed a mixed within/between-subjects design with two experimental conditions: hypnosis and music control. Participants experienced either an active-alert hypnotic induction (with test suggestions omitted to avoid altering EDA) or 12 minutes of carefully selected music pieces for the control condition, followed by a deinduction phase of 2 minutes using different music.

EDA was measured bilaterally on the shoulders with Skintact FS-RG1 disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes and OpenEDA software. Skin conductance level (SCL) was analyzed using Ledalab 3.4.9, with laterality coefficients calculated to assess shifts in dominance between left and right sides of the body.

**Results:**

- A significant main effect of time for left-side SCL indicated that EDA levels rose over time during the hypnosis condition, particularly prominent in high hypnotizables.
- For right-side SCL, a significant interaction between condition, time, and hypnotizability was found:
  - In the hypnosis condition, high hypnotizables started with lower skin conductance that increased during the induction, while low hypnotizables began with higher skin conductance that remained unchanged.
  - In the music control condition, low hypnotizables showed lower skin conductance initially compared to high hypnotizables, which had a downward tendency.
- A significant interaction between condition, time, and hypnotizability was found for laterality coefficients:
  - High hypnotizables shifted toward right-side dominance during the induction phase; low hypnotizables showed left-side dominance.
  - No such shifts were observed during the music control condition.

**Discussion:**

The results of this study support the notion that hypnosis is associated with a shift toward right hemispheric activity, with high and low hypnotizables demonstrating different patterns:

- High hypnotizables showed a shift to right-dominant lateral asymmetry during the induction phase. This suggests decreased left hemispheric activation, aligning with previous research indicating that high hypnotizables demonstrate increased right posterior dominance and left hemispheric inhibition following hypnotic induction (Gruzelier, 1996).
- Low hypnotizables demonstrated a shift to left-sided electrodermal dominance during the induction phase. This result implies increased left hemispheric activation, possibly due to repeated suggestions for focused attention and verbal processing of the hypnotic induction (Rainville et al., 1999). Low hypnotizables might be less capable of inhibiting left hemispheric processes during hypnosis induction.
- Subjective experiences associated with hypnosis, such as altered state of awareness, body image changes, and perception (measured by the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory), were correlated with a shift toward the right side during the hypnosis induction phase. These findings further support that hypnosis is related to hemispheric dominance shifts towards the right.
- The study highlights the importance and utility of employing bilateral EDA measurements in hypnosis research, as unilateral approaches might miss crucial laterality-related information.

In summary, this study provides evidence for distinct patterns of hemispheric dominance shifts during hypnotic induction between high and low hypnotizables, with subjective experiences associated with hypnosis linked to rightward lateral asymmetry.


The research paper titled "Electrodermal Laterality in the Hypnotic Induction" explores the relationship between hypnosis, hemispheric dominance shifts, and subjective experiences. The study involved 32 participants who underwent an active-alert hypnotic induction and a music control condition while their bilateral electrodermal activity (EDA) was recorded to gather information about changes in hemispheric dominance.

Key findings:

1. **Hemispheric Dominance Shifts**: The results suggest that highly hypnotizable participants exhibit a shift towards right-hemisphere dominance, while low hypnotizables display a shift to left-hemisphere dominance in response to the induction. In contrast, no shifts in laterality were observed in the control group (listening to music).

2. **Correlation with Hypnotic Experiences**: Seven out of eight dimensions correlated with electrodermal shift during hypnosis have been previously associated with hypnotic susceptibility. Specifically, a substantial right-sided EDA lateral shift during the induction was linked to heightened altered experience, altered state of awareness, perception, and body image. Conversely, increased left-hemisphere activity was associated with higher rationality, self-awareness, volitional control, and memory.

3. **Importance of Hypnotic Induction**: The findings underscore the importance of the hypnotic induction process, as it leads to altered EDA functioning unseen during non-hypnotic conditions (like music listening). This indicates that hypnosis elicits unique neurophysiological responses.

4. **No Correlation with Music Condition**: The researchers found no correlation between subjective reports and laterality shift in the music condition, reinforcing differences in brain activity during hypnotic vs non-hypnotic inductions.

5. **Potential Real-Time Monitoring**: Given advancements in technology, researchers and clinicians could potentially monitor EDA bilaterally in real time to optimize hypnosis results, enhancing depth of trance or altered consciousness in both research and clinical settings.

Limitations:

1. The study was exploratory, requiring further replication to confirm the relationship between subjective experiences and laterality shift.
2. Emotional effects of music were not controlled for, which could introduce bias in EDA readings. Suggestions for future research include using a neutral control condition resembling hypnotic induction and employing recorded inductions to eliminate variations in their length.

Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of how hypnosis affects brain function by demonstrating distinct hemispheric dominance shifts correlated with specific subjective experiences during hypnotic induction compared to non-hypnotic conditions. It opens avenues for further research into optimizing hypnotic techniques using real-time neurophysiological monitoring.


### 00-Husserl_ Heidegger_ and the Transcendental Dimension of Phenomenology

The article "Husserl, Heidegger, and the Transcendental Dimension of Phenomenology" by Archana Barua explores the philosophical approaches of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, focusing on their shared commitment to phenomenology, a methodology that prioritizes the experiential dimension of meaning.

1. **Husserl's Phenomenology**: Husserl's philosophy revolves around understanding "what it is for us to know?" or "what it is for us to be conscious of anything?". He posits that humans are essentially explorers of a transcendental realm of meaning, where knowing and being are intertwined. Husserl's phenomenology aims to provide an alternative way of understanding things by focusing on the experiential dimension of meaning. Unlike empiricism or analytic tradition, which abstract experience into words, Husserl's approach considers experience as inherently meaningful and relational.

2. **Descartes and Kant Influence**: Husserl modifies Descartes' position by introducing phenomenological bracketing to reveal essential structures of subjectivity beyond the engaged mode of experiencing. He criticizes Kant for failing to fulfill his transcendental philosophy's promise, aiming to do so in his own transcendental phenomenology.

3. **Transcendental Subjectivity**: Husserl's transcendental idealism situates itself on a 'higher' plane with the goal of uncovering a priori structures that account for objectivity. This involves stripping experiences from naturalistic interpretations to reveal their essential meanings, a process that is essentially intuitive.

4. **Commonalities with Heidegger**: Both Husserl and Heidegger share an emphasis on the primacy of experience as a foundation for understanding reality. Despite differences in methodology and language, both philosophers aim to uncover the meaning-giving center of transcendental subjectivity.

5. **Heidegger's Critique**: While Husserl focuses on theory, Heidegger adopts a praxis-centric approach emphasizing interpretation and avoiding reflection. This difference has led to tension between the two philosophers. However, Barua argues that both can be seen as phenomenological in their concern for restoring the experiential and lived dimension of meaning, albeit expressed differently.

6. **Phenomenological Reduction**: Both Husserl and Heidegger use reduction to uncover essential structures: Husserl from facts to essence (epoché), and Heidegger from beings to Being and the meaning of Being (hermeneutic circle). Despite their methodological differences, both philosophers aim at phenomenological reduction, leaving experience unfettered by theory or prejudice.

In essence, Barua's article aims to highlight the commonalities in Husserl and Heidegger's phenomenological approaches, arguing that their differences can be minimized when understood within a shared commitment to the transcendental dimension of meaning.


The text discusses the evolution and criticisms surrounding the concept of transcendental subjectivity within phenomenology, focusing on the works of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger.

Husserl's Transcendental Subjectivity:
Husserl proposed a form of transcendental subjectivity as a means to overcome limitations of empirical and psychological subjectivity. His transcendental ego serves as the philosophically necessary anchor for phenomenology, enabling it to trace meanings back to their ultimate origin in transcendental consciousness. This is crucial because, for Husserl, the intentionality of consciousness forms the foundational ground of philosophy. He believed that resources for transforming our understanding lie within us, accessible through a pure look devoid of participation but rather focused on storing energy for re-building.

Criticisms and Motivations:
Phenomenology has faced critiques regarding its association with neo-Kantian transcendental idealism. Critics argue that this consciousness-centric transcendental realm permits "unknown and unknowable" metaphysical entities to infiltrate philosophy, which is viewed as undesirable after the failures of spiritual and technological modernity.

Heidegger's Rejection:
Heidegger rejected this brand of transcendental subjectivity, viewing it as an alienation from the concrete world. He instead emphasized 'Dasein' (human existence) existing hermeneutically—engaged in an endless chain of interpretation with past and future thinkers.

Ricoeur's Perspective:
Paul Ricoeur, a significant interpreter of Husserl to the French audience, saw Heidegger's rejection as a response to what he perceived as neo-Kantian transcendental idealism in Husserl's phenomenology. Ricoeur differentiated between two approaches to phenomenality—one emphasizing sharp distinction of appearance and the other allowing pure consciousness to produce phenomenality. He preferred a realist interpretation over an orthodox one, respecting the rights of a transcendental psychology that transcends both realism and idealism, similar to Eastern insights into experience.

Hermeneutical Phenomenology:
Ricoeur, along with Heidegger and Gadamer, advocated for a hermeneutical phenomenology—one that interprets rather than merely describes experiences. This approach acknowledges the task of interpretation as a "learned word" suspicious of claims to immediate immediacy. It aims to explicate all symbolic structures indirectly connecting us with reality, thereby bridging experience and language without relying solely on linguistic structure.

In summary, the text explores how phenomenology, particularly through Husserl and Heidegger, grapples with the nature of subjectivity in understanding our experiences. Criticisms arise from concerns that transcendental subjectivity opens a door for metaphysical speculations incompatible with contemporary pragmatic cultures. In response, hermeneutical phenomenology emerges as an approach focused on interpretation, trying to bridge experience and language while avoiding the pitfalls of both realism and idealism.


The provided text is a philosophical analysis comparing the views of two significant phenomenologists, Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, with a focus on their interpretations of subjectivity and truth. 

1. **Hermeneutics and Interpretation**: The text starts by emphasizing that human existence is inherently hermeneutical or interpretive, as proposed by Palmer (1980). This idea is central to both Husserl's and Heidegger's phenomenology. 

2. **Heidegger’s Critique of Husserl**: Steven Crowell discusses how Heidegger, despite critiquing Husserl's "theoretism," implicitly relies on his concept that phenomenology is reflective clarification rather than theory. Heidegger rejects Husserl’s transcendental subjectivity, viewing it as still influenced by Cartesian dualism where the 'subject' loses connection with the world. 

3. **Husserl's Transcendental Subjectivity**: Crowell argues that Husserl's notion of transcendental subjectivity is ethically motivated, representing solitary self-responsibility in philosophical inquiry. Reduction in phenomenology, for Husserl, shifts focus from objects perceived to the ways they are consciously known or imagined, not introspection or turning inward. 

4. **Heidegger's Dasein**: Heidegger introduces 'Dasein' (mode of human being), which is fundamentally different from other entities because it has the capacity for transcendental constitution. Unlike Husserl, Heidegger believes that even the 'human being' term reduces transcendental phenomenology to ontological anthropology.

5. **Husserl vs. Heidegger on Ego**: Dermot Moran finds it challenging to understand how Husserl's absolute ego differs from the ever-factical "I". Crowell asserts that Heidegger uses 'Dasein' (human being) to undermine the notion that philosophical inquiry into concrete subjectivity is only empirical and psychological. This is possible, Crowell argues, because Heidegger adopts Husserl's phenomenology while remaining within transcendental philosophy's framework.

6. **Hermeneutics in Phenomenology**: The text also touches on the role of hermeneutics (interpretive reading) in phenomenology, referencing authors like Ihde (1999), Hahn (1995), and Feenberg (1999). 

In essence, this passage explores the nuanced differences between two prominent phenomenologists' views on subjectivity, truth, and human existence. It underscores how their perspectives, while critical of each other, remain interconnected through shared foundations in phenomenological methodology.


### 00-Linguistic understanding_ perception and inference

This paper, authored by Anna Drożdżowicz and Kim Pedersen Phillips, focuses on the philosophical debates surrounding linguistic understanding, specifically examining the roles of perception and inference. The authors begin by presenting various scenarios where linguistic understanding is essential for everyday communication, such as reading news or engaging in conversations.

The paper introduces two primary approaches to understanding linguistic utterances:
1. Inferential approach: This perspective posits that we understand utterances by making inferences about the speaker's intended meaning based on our knowledge of language, context, and background information. Proponents include Allott (2023), Carston (2002), Sperber & Wilson (1995), and Stanley (2005).
2. Perceptual approach: This view claims that understanding utterances involves perceptual or quasi-perceptual capacities, allowing us to directly "perceive" the meaning of an utterance without necessarily employing inferences. Brogaard (2018, 2020), Fricker (2003), Nes (2017), and Recanati (2002) are key figures associated with this approach.

The authors then delve into conceptual and methodological clarifications regarding linguistic understanding:
- They distinguish between different types of understanding, such as achievement-understanding (the process of coming to understand an utterance), state-understanding (the output or knowledge gained from achievement-understanding), and ability-understanding (dispositional tendencies to achieve-understand).
- The authors discuss the various characterizations of linguistic understanding, including:
    * Knowledge that the speaker said something (Evans 1982)
    * Conscious awareness of what was said (Hunter 1998)
    * Quasi-perception of what was said (Fricker 2003)
    * A perceptual seeming of what was said (Brogaard 2018, 2020)
    * States of entertaining the content (Longworth 2018)
    * Belief in what was said (Millikan 2004)
- The authors also highlight terminological distinctions between 'utterance understanding' and 'comprehension,' with the former often used as a success term.

The paper emphasizes that linguistic understanding is a complex phenomenon, influenced by contextual factors, internal (attention span, mood) and external (stakes, distractions). The authors note that while linguistic understanding can be immediate, unreflective, and effortless in many cases, there are instances when it requires deliberate reflection. This reflective interpretation may rely on cognitive, meta-linguistic, and metacognitive abilities, which vary among individuals depending on literacy, background knowledge, and shared cultural assumptions.

In conclusion, the authors argue for a multidisciplinary approach to studying linguistic understanding by integrating metaphysical, epistemological, and psychological perspectives. They suggest that addressing these questions in tandem will yield more comprehensive insights into the nature of linguistic understanding, its epistemological role, and the psychological mechanisms underlying it.


This text discusses the philosophical debate surrounding linguistic understanding, specifically focusing on two main perspectives: perceptual views and inferential views. 

1. Semantic Perceptual View: Proponents of this view argue that understanding language involves perceiving meaning properties, similar to how we perceive other sensory information. They point to the automatic and involuntary nature of understanding, as well as cases where our mental states can be nonveridical (illusions of understanding). Examples like contrast cases, where hearing an utterance without understanding it differs from hearing it and comprehending it, are used to illustrate this phenomenon.

2. Criticisms of the Semantic Perceptual View: This view has been criticized on various grounds. One argument, known as Casey O'Callaghan's homophones argument (2011), suggests that semantic properties don't necessarily influence our experience and that contrast cases might be better explained by factors other than perceiving meaning properties.

3. Brogaard's Defense of Semantic Perception: Ludwig Brogaard (2018) argues for a version of the semantic perceptual view, stating that auditory experiences of meaning result from extensive top-down influences of background context information. She claims these top-down processes rely on cognitive functions affecting the perceptual system via attentional mechanisms. Brogaard posits that understanding utterances is a form of perception, not inferential conscious inference.

4. Arguments Against Semantic Perception: Luca Gasparri and Miguel Murez (2021) challenge Brogaard's view by arguing that context-sensitivity in utterance meaning necessitates cognitive inference, which cannot be accounted for solely by top-down processes. Fabrizio Calzavarini (2023) also critiques the semantic perceptual view, contending that empirical evidence concerning brain areas and networks underlying language comprehension contradicts this theory.

5. Role of Inference in Linguistic Understanding: The text explores whether inference plays a role in linguistic understanding. Some philosophers, like Jason Stanley (2005), claim that context-sensitive expressions are guided by consciously accessible inferences from background beliefs. Brogaard (2020) describes language comprehension as an inferential process, although not necessarily conscious or at the personal level. However, Gross (2024) argues against this view, asserting that empirical research on evidence insensitivity and the Stroop effect does not support semantic perception.

6. Epistemology of Linguistic Understanding: The paper touches upon epistemological aspects of linguistic understanding – how it provides justification for beliefs about others' communicative acts and testimonial beliefs. Some views argue that utterance understanding plays an inferential role, with justification deriving from further justified beliefs or background knowledge. Others propose a non-inferential approach, modeling linguistic understanding's epistemic role on perceptual states.

The special issue discussed in the text brings together various contributions to these debates, including critiques and defenses of inferential and perceptual views of linguistic understanding, their implications for knowledge of language, meaning, and testimony, as well as arguments concerning the role of inference and perception in understanding what was said.


This text is a bibliography listing various scholarly works on philosophy, psychology, and linguistics, primarily focusing on the topics of understanding, inference, perception, cognition, and speech comprehension. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Peter Boghossian (2014) - "What is Inference?"**: This work explores the concept of inference in philosophy, discussing its role in reasoning and understanding.

### 00-Phenomenology as Embodied Knowing and Sharing_ Kindling Audience Participation

Title: Phenomenology as Embodied Knowing and Sharing: Kindling Audience Participation

Authors: Kathleen Galvin and Les Todres

Journal: Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology (Volume 12, Special Edition, July 2012)

Summary:

The authors, Kathleen Galvin and Les Todres, discuss the concept of phenomenology as embodied knowing and sharing, focusing on how this approach can foster audience participation. They present a unique methodology that combines phenomenological research with poetry, specifically Japanese Renga, to better understand human experiences within community contexts.

The paper begins by highlighting the limitations of traditional philosophy, which has often been dominated by solitary thinkers. The authors propose that phenomenology can evolve towards an "awakening of presences," focusing on the embodied and relational aspects of understanding. This approach emphasizes a 'knowing with the heart,' allowing one to imagine another's world, essential for empathic care in healthcare settings.

Galvin and Todres introduce the notion of shared understanding within communities, questioning how embodied relational understanding can be effectively communicated. They draw on philosophers like Gadamer, Gendlin, and Levinas to conceptualize two key dimensions: an embodied self that gives meaning to understanding (Gendlin) and the importance of openness to others' alterity or difference (Levinas).

The authors present Renga as a form of poetry that can facilitate this shared understanding. They explain how Renga, traditionally written by two or more collaborators with sequential steps, can be adapted for audience participation in phenomenological research. The process involves an initial evocative description of a scenario (e.g., faecal incontinence), followed by participants contributing lines to the Renga, based on their bodily felt sense and personal response to the described experience.

In their symposium example, Galvin engaged researchers and poets in writing a Renga related to the scenario of faecal incontinence. Participants contributed lines that built upon each other's contributions, focusing on both their bodily felt sense and the broader experience. This collaborative process allowed for a shared understanding of the phenomenon while preserving individual nuances.

The authors conclude by discussing the implications of this embodied, participatory approach to phenomenology. They argue that it expands the notion of evidence and provides a more inclusive way of understanding human experiences in healthcare and other contexts. The approach encourages an ongoing dialogue between participants, allowing for the awakening of presences and deepening understanding through shared meanings.

Keywords: phenomenology, embodied knowing, sharing, Renga poetry, audience participation, healthcare, empathic care.


Title: Phenomenology as Embodied Knowing and Sharing: Kindling Audience Participation 

Authors: Kate Galvin and Les Todres

Journal: Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology (Special Edition, July 2012)

Overview:
The paper by Galvin and Todres explores the potential of phenomenology as a method for embodied knowing and sharing through audience participation. They discuss their experiences with Renga, a form of collaborative poetry, as a means to engage participants in a shared understanding of human vulnerabilities and existential issues within healthcare.

Key Concepts:

1. Embodied Knowing: Galvin and Todres emphasize that phenomenology should not be limited to cognitive or aesthetic presences but include embodied experiences as well. They argue for the importance of bringing "right up close" our human connectedness through bodily experiences, thereby fostering an embodied relational understanding crucial in caring practices.

2. Shared Presence: The authors propose the idea that phenomenology can involve the awakening and sharing of presences—a concept they term "real presences." These are not merely mental representations but dynamic, unfolding structures of activity with a life of their own, transcending individual participants yet interdependently involving them.

3. Renga as Participative Process: Galvin and Todres describe how they used Renga to kindle audience participation, aiming for shared embodied understanding rather than simply conveying meaning from one person to another. The process involves bringing sensitive topics (e.g., humiliation scenarios) "up close," intending to evoke an embodied response and palpable presence in the room.

4. Evocation vs Provocation: The authors reflect on the unpredictability of their participative approach, considering the fine line between evoking a presence that grabs participants' attention and provoking unsettling or overwhelming reactions. They argue for a balance between awakening and sharing presences while being mindful of the potential emotional impact on the audience.

5. Responsibility and Safety: Galvin and Todres stress the importance of ensuring that audiences are informed about the nature of experiences involved, granting them freedom to engage or withdraw as needed. They acknowledge the risks in their approach—such as upsetting participants—but argue these risks are necessary for generating fresh insights and felt understandings rooted in immediate experiences.

6. Phenomenology's Direction: The authors suggest that phenomenological projects might benefit from embracing "awakening and sharing" of presences, emphasizing the importance of intertwining senses, moods, qualities, and inter-subjective contexts in understanding. They propose a broader definition of evidence that goes beyond third-person accounts to include first- and second-person experiences as well.

Conclusion:
Galvin and Todres present phenomenology as an approach that can foster embodied knowing and sharing, encouraging readers to consider how literature and poetry facilitate such experiences in phenomenological exploration. They argue for a phenomenological project centered on opening up authorship in participative ways, engaging more aesthetically in knowing while honoring relational realities of presences—a stance that distinguishes their approach from postmodern relativism.


Title: The Ethical Work of Expressing Research: Revealing the Remoralizing Power of Pathic Action

Authors: Willis, P., & Borbasi, S. 

Publication: In M. Tarozzi & L. Mortari (Eds.), Phenomenology and Human Science Research Today (pp. 226-245). Budapest: Zeta Books (2010)

Summary and Explanation:

In this chapter, authors Patricia Willis and Savina Borbasi discuss the ethical dimensions of research expression, focusing on what they term 'pathic action.' Pathic action refers to the researcher's emotional engagement or response within the research process. 

1. The Remoralizing Power of Pathic Action: 
   - Willis and Borbasi argue that pathic action can have a remoralizing effect, meaning it helps reaffirm or reinstate ethical principles in research. 
   - They suggest that this happens through an emotional connection with participants or the research context, which can foster empathy and understanding. 

2. Expressing Research Ethically:
   - The authors assert that expressing research ethically involves more than just adhering to formal ethical guidelines; it requires an ongoing process of self-reflection and interpretation during data collection and analysis. 
   - This expression, they propose, is facilitated by pathic action – the researcher's emotional engagement with the research subject matter. 

3. Phenomenological Perspective:
   - Drawing from a phenomenological perspective, Willis and Borbasi emphasize the importance of subjective experience in understanding human phenomena. 
   - They suggest that pathic action allows the researcher to fully immerse themselves in the participant's world, thereby enhancing the richness and depth of the data collected.

4. Balancing Objectivity and Subjectivity:
   - The authors recognize the tension between maintaining objectivity (detachment) and allowing for subjective experiences in research. 
   - They propose that pathic action does not compromise objectivity but rather enhances it, as emotional engagement can lead to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon under study.

5. Ethical Challenges:
   - Willis and Borbasi acknowledge potential ethical dilemmas in pathic action, such as the risk of over-identification with participants or blurring boundaries between researcher and researched. 
   - They suggest that these challenges can be navigated through rigorous self-reflection, ongoing supervision, and adherence to established ethical guidelines.

In conclusion, Willis and Borbasi propose that pathic action – the researcher's emotional engagement in the process – is a crucial yet under-explored aspect of ethical research practice. They argue it not only enriches the research but also serves as a remoralizing force by keeping the researcher connected to their ethical responsibilities. This perspective emphasizes the importance of subjective experiences in human science research and encourages self-awareness and reflection from researchers.


### 01-Digging up concrescences_ a hermeneutics for process archaeology

In this paper, Shaun Gallagher proposes a reinterpretation of archaeological practice through the lens of process philosophy, specifically Alfred North Whitehead's concept of concrescence, and enactive hermeneutics. Instead of viewing archaeology as 'digging up the past' or unearthing static artifacts (concreta), Gallagher argues that it is more accurate to consider it as uncovering concrescences – dynamic processes involving an artifact's emergence, interpretation, and significance within a broader ecology of practices.

Whitehead's concrescence refers to the becoming or process that constitutes an actual entity, whereas a concretum is a past concrescence that has ceased being a concrescence, now existing as a 'completely determinate matter of fact.' Gallagher suggests that concreta are abstractions, stripped of their affordance-related meaning, while concrescences retain this significance. He highlights the relational nature of concrescences and concretums, with transition being a form of concrescence that shapes the concrescence through its physical prehension.

Gallagher connects these concepts to enactive hermeneutics, which emphasizes that no artifact (past or present) is entirely determinate; instead, its meaning is enacted in an ecology of practices and changes when viewed from different perspectives. Archaeological interpretation, therefore, cannot be reduced to a purely cognitive recognition but involves embodied and affective responses to the object's significance.

The author illustrates these ideas through an analysis of archaeological practice, specifically focusing on artifact interpretation. Gallagher references 'What in the World,' a 1950s television show featuring archaeologists analyzing unearthed artifacts, to demonstrate that interpretation emerges from a complex concrescent process involving perception, action, and interaction with others. In this context, the artifact (concretum) actively shapes the interpretive process by presenting affordances for use and resistance to hypotheses as experts engage in dialogue and manipulation.

Gallagher concludes that from an enactive hermeneutics perspective, artifacts are never entirely determinate matter of facts but remain concrescences, shaping our understanding through their engagement with the interpretive process. This engagement brings together past and present worlds in a 'fusion of horizons' where meaning is structured within dynamic processes, not predetermined or predefined.

The paper ultimately suggests that archaeology should be viewed as uncovering concrescences – dynamic processes involving artifacts, their interpretation, and the ecology of practices surrounding them – rather than merely excavating static objects from the past.

### 01-Enacting recovery_ Virtual reality_ active inference_ and cognitive behavioural therapy for de

Title: Enacting Recovery: Virtual Reality, Active Inference, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Depression

Authors: Nicola Chinchella & Ben White

Published: Philosophical Psychology, 2025

Summary:

The article discusses the potential of virtual reality (VR) in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating depression by integrating the active inference framework (AIF). The authors argue that VR can be used to introduce flexibility into an individual's action-based world models, disrupting rigid patterns characteristic of depression.

1. Introduction:
The paper begins by highlighting the potential of digital technologies, particularly VR, in treating psychological and mental health conditions. It emphasizes that mental health issues can be understood as a shrinkage in the agent-environment interaction space and as "stuck states" that need to be broken. Despite initial promising results, VR has not shown significant benefits in depression treatment according to multiple meta-analyses. The authors propose that this could be due to a lack of theoretical principles guiding VR application in therapy.

2. Depression and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy:
The article provides an overview of major depressive disorder, its prevalence, and the recommended treatments, which include antidepressant medications and psychological-behavioral interventions like CBT. CBT is described as targeting dysfunctional interactions between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to disrupt and restructure them.

3. Active Inference Framework (AIF):
The authors introduce the AIF, a neuroscientific theory focusing on probabilistic belief updating and uncertainty minimization through embodied action and environmental affordances. The AIF explains how agents minimize free energy by updating their beliefs about states they expect to visit, called priors, and likelihoods mapping the probability of observing specific inputs given the state the system is in.

4. Integration of AIF with CBT and VR:
The authors propose that CBT's focus on intervening in cycles of belief, action, and perception aligns well with the AIF. They argue that VR can be used to introduce a zone of just-manageable uncertainty for patients, facilitating better than expected rates of error reduction by engaging them in skilled actions. This approach aims to update implicit beliefs regarding the outcomes of actions, particularly through curated virtual affordances that maximize learning rates related to desired outcomes.

5. Error Dynamics, Affectivity, and Affordances:
The AIF tracks not only individual prediction errors but also how a system reduces uncertainty over time (error dynamics). This aspect connects with an agent's phenomenological experience of mood and emotion. Lower-than-expected rates of error reduction generate negative moods, while higher-than-expected rates produce positive moods. The AIF allows for short-term increases in prediction errors to achieve greater long-term uncertainty reduction (exploratory actions).

6. Conclusion:
The authors suggest that the AIF provides a theoretical foundation for understanding and enhancing CBT's efficacy through VR technology, potentially addressing its current limitations by introducing more flexibility into individuals' world models. They propose that curated virtual affordances can disrupt rigid patterns of depression by maximizing learning rates related to desired outcomes in a zone of just-manageable uncertainty.

Keywords: Active inference; Virtual reality; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Depression; Enactivism; Affordances.


The text discusses the application of Active Inference Framework (AIF) to understanding depression and potential therapeutic interventions using Virtual Reality (VR).

1. AIF and Depression: The AIF posits that depression arises from dysfunctions in learning rates, overly precise priors, and maladaptive internal estimates of precision of both internal and external cues. This results in a lack of flexibility in action-based world models, leading to a rigid prior for failure, withdrawal, avoidance, and passivity. This perspective views depression as a malady of agent-environment dynamics rather than a purely neurobiological phenomenon.

2. VR and Depression: The predictive brain is "hackable," meaning it can be influenced through strategic manipulation of contextual cues, such as in the placebo effect. VR, with its immersive power, offers significant potential for therapeutic interventions by altering precision weightings and bodily rhythms. 

3. Existing Approaches: Previous studies have used VR to treat depression by fostering well-being and mood (Edge of the Present) or to improve self-compassion and reduce self-criticism. These interventions, while promising, lack a clear progressive structure or foundational theoretical principles for application within Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

4. AIF-Based Principles for Optimal Treatment: The text proposes an AIF-grounded approach to VR treatment of depression, focusing on three key mechanisms: rigid priors, dysfunctional learning rates, and maladaptive cues. 

   a. Embodied Experience: Treatment should be as fully embodied as possible, using immersive, emotionally charged social scenarios that reflect themes from patients' real lives. This involves creating an external world that resembles the real one (sights, sounds, spatial positioning) and allowing patients to embody themselves in a resembling avatar integrating both exteroceptive and interoceptive sensory modalities.

   b. Precision-Engineered Learning: The environment should strategically craft a landscape of affordances embedding progressive goal structures tailored to an individual's skills, while maintaining a field of affordances that keeps the patient in a state of optimized learning (not too easy or too hard). This involves manipulating the perceived levels of uncertainty in the environment to modulate learning rates.

   c. Surprising Engagements: Affordances should provide small but constant surprises, leading to "just better than expected outcomes." These engagements aim to update stuck priors regarding available reward gradually over time through repeated interactions with affordances.

5. Challenges and Future Directions: Implementing this approach poses practical and technological challenges, such as utilizing fast bio-adaptive feedback from wearable technology or eye-tracking devices to monitor patient attention and adjust the virtual environment accordingly. Ensuring that positive outcomes are modeled as plausible results of the agent's actions is crucial to avoid undermining the generative model's reliability.

In summary, this text suggests that VR, grounded in the AIF, can be a powerful tool for treating depression by strategically manipulating environmental affordances and precision weightings to update maladaptive beliefs and foster a sense of agency and competence. The approach emphasizes embodied experiences, precision-engineered learning, and surprising yet plausible engagements tailored to individual patients' skills and needs.


Title: Principles for Designing Virtual Reality Therapies for Depression Based on Active Inference Framework (AIF)

The text discusses principles for designing virtual reality (VR) therapies for depression, grounded in the Active Inference Framework (AIF). The AIF is a theory that explains how the brain makes predictions about sensory input to maintain beliefs about the world and act effectively within it. Here are detailed explanations of the principles:

1. Precision Learning: VR environments should elicit and maintain specific learning rates through modulation of environmental uncertainty. Initially, increase learning rate as subjects complete goals and skilled tasks, then lower uncertainty to solidify a network of implicit beliefs. Changes should be gradual, not violating high-level expectations about success likelihood.

2. Generalizability: The VR-induced learning must generalize to non-virtual settings. Updated precision weighting and priors must influence the subject's daily life. However, VR worlds shouldn't be mundane or disheartening, as this could reinforce low moods. A study on VR-based roleplay for depression demonstrates this principle by engaging patients in immersive, emotionally charged social scenarios that reflect real-life themes.

3. Temporal Expansion: Goal structures should be temporally extended and multi-step, requiring planning. These goals must elicit new behaviors rather than relying on engrained habitual routines. In a videogame context, this resembles strategy-planning games like SimCity where players design cities considering long-term consequences for growth, traffic, and finances.

4. Avoid Volatility: The uncertainty profile in the VR experience should be stable and fit to individual control needs. Unpredictable changes in difficulty can trigger meta-uncertainty linked with depression, negative affect, and other psychopathologies like PTSD. The stability of uncertainty holds across varying levels of challenge, as seen in "idle games" (unchallenging) and "souls-like" games (frustratingly difficult).

5. Enjoyment: The VR therapeutic experience should allow sensory and emotional pleasure, leading to an overall enjoyable experience. This increases patients' willingness to continue therapy and recall it in their daily lives. Examples include spectacular landscapes (Habak et al., 2020) or a mix of compassion and reassurance (Falconer et al., 2016).

The paper emphasizes that depression is not just a negative mood but a deep disruption in our sense of self and capacity to act. Effective VR therapies should address this by meeting depression on its terms, shifting structures of anticipation towards positive outcomes gradually.


Karl Friston's "Free Energy Principle" is a unified theory of the brain that posits it as an engine that minimizes free energy, which he defines as the difference between expectations and sensory input. This principle suggests that the brain is always generating predictions about the world (internal models) and comparing them to actual sensory data. When there's a discrepancy, the brain adjusts its internal models to reduce this "prediction error."

Friston applies this principle across various domains, including biological systems, self-consciousness, and active inference - a process theory of perception, learning, and action. In active inference, the brain is seen as an inferential machine that actively generates hypotheses about its environment to minimize surprise or uncertainty (free energy).

In the context of mental health, Friston's Free Energy Principle has been applied in several ways:

1. Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET): This approach uses immersive virtual environments to treat phobias and anxiety disorders. By gradually exposing patients to feared stimuli in a controlled virtual environment, therapists can help individuals confront their fears and extinguish associated negative associations.

2. Predictive Coding: A related theory to the Free Energy Principle, predictive coding suggests that our perception is based on making predictions about incoming sensory information. In the context of mental health, abnormalities in prediction error processing might underlie symptoms of disorders like depression and schizophrenia.

3. Mentalizing: This is the ability to understand one's own and others' mental states, which is crucial for social cognition. The Free Energy Principle can be seen as a framework for understanding how we generate and update our internal models of others' mental states.

4. Habit Formation: Friston's work also contributes to understanding habit formation through caching mechanisms, suggesting that habits emerge from the brain's attempts to minimize prediction errors over time.

5. Emotion Regulation: The Free Energy Principle can help explain emotional regulation by proposing that emotions represent predictions about the world and our place in it. When these predictions are violated, we experience negative emotions; conversely, positive emotions reflect a reduced prediction error.

6. Depression as Prediction Error Dysregulation: Some researchers propose that depression might arise from a dysregulated prediction error mechanism – the brain is overly sensitive to discrepancies between expectations and reality, leading to persistent negative mood.

In summary, Friston's Free Energy Principle offers a unifying framework for understanding how the brain processes information and generates behavior, with implications for various aspects of mental health, including treatment approaches like VRET, models of disorders such as depression, and our understanding of fundamental cognitive processes like perception, learning, and emotion regulation.


### 01-Functionalism about inference

The article "Functionalism about Inference" by Jared Warren proposes a functionalist theory of inference, addressing several key aspects such as the nature of inference, its role in cognition, and the criteria for what constitutes an inference. Here's a summary and explanation of the main points:

1. **Definition of Inference**: Inference is understood as a transition between mental states (attitudes like acceptance or rejection) where premise-attitudes cause conclusion-attitude in a way that plays the 'inference role.' This approach builds upon the causal account but refines it by incorporating functional roles to screen out non-inferential causal paths.

2. **Folk Theory of Inference**: The author defends a Lewis-style functionalism, which considers inference as a concept from folk psychology or manifest image. It exists at the level of everyday understanding, acknowledging that it may not capture all intricacies of cognitive processes but remains crucial for practical purposes.

3. **The Inference Role**: Warren introduces 'COUNTERFACTUAL' as a necessary condition to define the inference role: If a thinker's premise-attitudes cause their conclusion-attitude in an inference, then they have a stable disposition to cite those premises (or negations) when asked for reasons under normal conditions immediately after accepting the conclusion.

4. **Accommodating Various Inference Demands**: The COUNTERFACTUAL condition is designed to meet several demands on a theory of inference:
   - **Taking**: It captures the idea that inferences involve taking premises as supportive of the conclusion and drawing it based on this fact, though not necessarily in a response-dependent manner.
   - **Practicality**: Intensions (intentions) can be cited to account for practical reasoning involving actions.
   - **Redundancy**: Particular premises can be cited as reasons even if the conclusion is already believed.
   - **Triviality**: Axioms and basic principles can be inferred from themselves in a limiting sense, acknowledging that this is a matter of uniformity rather than theoretical weight.
   - **Vacuity**: Previous inferential steps can be cited to justify current conclusions, allowing for vacuous inferences.

5. **Sophisticated Inferences**: Warren suggests that more sophisticated inferences may involve not just the premise-attitudes but also a judgment of the relevant alethic connection between premises and conclusion in causing the acceptance of the conclusion attitude. This adds depth to our understanding of complex reasoning processes.

6. **Handling Moorean Phenomena**: The theory aims to explain inferential Moorean phenomena – it is impossible or irrational to infer p from q and judge that this inference is not good simultaneously. This is achieved by acknowledging the role of judgments in sophisticated inferences without making inference completely response-dependent.

In essence, Warren's functionalist theory of inference attempts to provide a unified framework that can accommodate various aspects of our understanding and experience of reasoning while avoiding pitfalls such as response-dependency and overly demanding criteria. It emphasizes the importance of cognitive pen


The text presents a functionalist theory of inference by J. Warren, which characterizes inference based on three conditions: COUNTERFACTUAL, ALIGNMENT, and CONTROL. 

1. COUNTERFACTUAL: If a thinker's premise-attitudes cause their conclusion-attitude in a way that would play the inference role, then it is counterfactually dependent on those premises for the truth of its conclusion. This means that if the premises were false, the conclusion would likely also be false.

2. ALIGNMENT: If a thinker's premise-attitudes cause their conclusion-attitude in a way that plays the inference role, then the thinker's inferential attitudes are aligned - their stable dispositions do not generate inferential Moorean phenomena (in normal conditions). This condition addresses the instability of judging an inference as both taken and disavowed.

3. CONTROL: If a thinker's premise-attitudes cause their conclusion-attitude in a way that plays the inference role, then the formation of the conclusion attitude can be partially but directly controlled by the thinker (in normal conditions). This condition emphasizes that inference is action-like rather than completely under the will.

These three conditions together make up Warren's sophisticated inference: a thinker's premise-attitudes, along with their belief that these premises provide sufficient reason for accepting this conclusion, directly cause that conclusion attitude in a way that plays the inference role. This accounts for both explicit and implicit inferences in complex creatures like humans.

Warren also discusses the controversial idea of inference rule-following (RULES), which suggests that following an inference rule is constitutive of inference. Warren argues against this, citing cases where mistaken inferences are not guided by rules and instances where general reasoning might not be rule-governed. He points out that even if humans follow rules in their deductive reasoning, the application of these rules may be aided by case-specific heuristics.

The author acknowledges that while inference rule-following might account for TAKING (the idea that inferences involve taking premises as reasons), it is not necessary to explain other aspects of inference, such as its action-like nature and productivity. Instead, Warren proposes that these features can be explained by COUNTERFACTUAL, ALIGNMENT, and CONTROL.

Warren's theory allows for degrees of satisfaction of these conditions, acknowledging indeterminacy in some cases of automatic or unconscious reasoning. He distinguishes between genuine inferences (that satisfy the inference role) and other contentful state transitions that do not qualify as inferences, especially in non-human animals and young children.

The paper concludes by reiterating Warren's commitment to a functionalist approach, which does not impose specific physical demands on the causal states realizing inference but focuses on their ability to realize the inferred role. This allows for possibilities such as Martians or robots inferring in ways similar to humans.


Jared Warren is a philosopher who has contributed to various areas of philosophy, including the philosophy of mind, epistemology, and formal logic. Here's a detailed summary of some of his key works:

1. **"Killing Kripkenstein's Monster" (2020a)**: In this paper, Warren engages with a thought experiment by W.V.O. Quine, known as "Kripkenstein's Monster," which questions the possibility of meaning a term if one does not know its extension (reference). Warren argues against Quine's position, contending that it leads to an unacceptable skepticism. He proposes an alternative view where understanding a term involves grasping both its intension (sense) and reference, but the lack of knowledge about reference doesn't undermine understanding.

2. **"Shadows of Syntax" (2020b)**: Here, Warren critiques the 'Syntax-First' approach to formal semantics, which posits that logical syntax is prior to semantics. He argues that this view leads to a problematic view of logical consequence and cannot account for the inferential role of content in reasoning. Instead, he defends an 'Inferentialism,' according to which logic and meaning are intertwined, and logical truths are those whose denial would entail a reductio ad absurdum.

3. **"Infinite Reasoning" (2021)**: In this paper, Warren explores the possibility of infinite reasoning processes, challenging the common assumption that all reasonable inferences must be finite. He proposes a model of "iterated reflection," where an agent reflects on their own reasoning process, leading to new considerations that further refine their judgments. This, he argues, can generate infinite sequences of reasons without any starting point or end.

4. **"Revisiting Quine on Truth by Convention" (2017)**: In this work, Warren reevaluates W.V.O. Quine's account of truth by convention. He argues that Quine's view, which posits that truth is a matter of convention, leads to counterintuitive consequences and fails to capture our intuitions about truth. Warren suggests a more nuanced account where truth is grounded in epistemic norms rather than sheer convention.

5. **"Infinite Reasoning" (2014)**: In this earlier work, Warren discusses the nature of logical consequence and argues that it cannot be captured by any finite set of rules or axioms. He proposes a view where logical consequence is understood as a form of iterated justification, where each step in an argument provides reasons that can be further scrutinized, potentially leading to an infinite regress of justifications.

Throughout his work, Warren often engages with issues surrounding the nature of meaning, reference, truth, logical consequence, and inference, frequently challenging traditional views and proposing novel alternatives grounded in our intuitions about reasoning and language use.


### 01-McDowell_ Phenomenology and the Awareness of the World

Donnchadh O'Conaill's article "McDowell, Phenomenology and the Awareness of the World" critiques John McDowell's account of perceptual awareness of the world. The central claim is that while McDowell argues our perceptions allow us to be aware of objects as part of a wider reality, his explanation lacks the necessary resources to show how this occurs independently of empirical judgments.

McDowell's position, outlined in works like "Mind and World," posits that perceptual experiences and our capacity for rational adjustment (empirical judgements) are mutually dependent. Perception actualizes conceptual capacities, which are then integrated into a broader network of such capacities. This network, when linked to empirical judgments, enables us to perceive objects as belonging to a wider reality, forming our worldview – a total set of empirical judgements about the world at any given time.

O'Conaill's main critique revolves around McDowell's explanation of how perceptual experiences present objects as part of a wider reality. O'Conaill argues that McDowell's account relies on the integration of conceptual capacities into one's overall network, or their connection to the worldview. However, these capacities are dispositional and do not fully explain why we perceive objects as belonging to a wider world.

O'Conaill identifies two possible ways to expand McDowell's explanation:

1. By focusing on the integration of conceptual capacities into one's overall network, but this is deemed insufficient because it does not address the actual deployment of these capacities in perceptual experiences.
2. By appealing to specific concepts actualized in perceptual experiences and their correspondence with our worldview. Yet, O'Conaill contends that this approach faces a dilemma: either the concept of "the world" has little determinate content (merely "whatever it is my world-view concerns"), or it becomes overly restrictive by tying it to particular conjunctions of concepts incompatible with all possible worldviews.

O'Conaill suggests that an alternative explanation might be found in transcendental phenomenology, which examines how the structures and operations of subjective experience enable our awareness of the world. He acknowledges a methodological concern: whether Husserlian phenomenology is compatible with McDowell's therapeutic approach aimed at dissolving "How possible?" questions. However, O'Conaill argues that McDowell's openness to facts and perceptual impressions aligns more closely with transcendental phenomenology than initially appears.

In the subsequent section, O'Conaill outlines Edmund Husserl's phenomenological account of our awareness of the world. According to Husserl, perceptual experiences present objects within an intentional content or sense that includes co-presented objects not currently being perceived. This broader context shapes expectations about what nearby objects might be like and presents them as belonging to a larger, pre-given world – a spatiotemporal whole containing many other possible perceivable objects and situations.

The sense of the world is intentional but distinct from specific intentional states or judgements. It is not tied to any particular scientific theory about the nature of reality, allowing phenomenology to avoid being burdened by changes in such theories. This pre-given world serves as a background for our daily activities and perceptions, guiding our engagement with specific aspects while remaining aware of its vastness.

O'Conaill concludes that Husserlian phenomenology can address the shortcomings in McDowell's account by providing a clearer explanation of how our perceptual experiences present objects as belonging to a wider reality, without relying on specific conceptual contents or empirical judgments. By focusing on the intentional structure of our perceptions and their engagement with a pre-given world, phenomenology offers an alternative perspective on this aspect of human cognition.


The paper discusses John McDowell's philosophical views on perception, specifically his assertion that we perceive objects as belonging to a wider world. The author argues that while McDowell correctly identifies this feature of perception, he does not fully explain how our awareness of the world arises in perceptual experiences.

To address this gap, the paper introduces the concept of "sense of the world" derived from phenomenology, particularly Husserl's transcendental phenomenology. This sense of the world is understood as an intentional structure within perceptual experiences that presents objects as belonging to a wider reality (the world) regardless of any judgements or theoretical commitments we might hold.

The author asserts several key points about this sense of the world:

1. It's not a conception of the world itself, but rather our perceptual awareness of it. This means acknowledging that our perceptions and activities do not constitute evidence for or against this sense. Instead, they are part of an intentional structure pre-given in perceptual experiences.

2. The sense of the world is not theoretical but pre-theoretical, meaning it cannot be built up from actions or interpretations. This suggests that our everyday perceptual awareness of the world is not subject to revision in the same way scientific or philosophical positions are.

3. It's crucial for understanding why objects appear as belonging to a wider reality. The structure of this sense inherently ties perceived objects to a broader context, enabling us to see them as part of an empirical world. This awareness is pre-rational—it doesn't depend on volitional control or justification by reason, yet it's a necessary condition for rational activities like testing judgements against perceptions.

4. The author distinguishes between two uses of 'rational'. One narrow use posits that only consciously chosen episodes under voluntary control count as rational. Under this definition, the sense of the world is non-rational because it's not a matter of choice and cannot be justified by reason. The second, broader use characterizes all instances where conceptual capacities are actualized as rational, regardless of whether they're under voluntary control or not.

5. The author argues that the sense of the world is part of a package deal with other rational relations between perceptual experiences and conceptual capacities. It's essential for our lives as rational beings but isn't itself an exercise of spontaneity (voluntary, reason-guided action).

The paper concludes by suggesting that incorporating the sense of the world into McDowell's account provides a better explanation of how perceptual experiences can give us awareness of objects as belonging to a wider reality. This sense is pre-rational and pre-theoretical, existing prior to our theoretical commitments or rational adjustments, yet it's fundamental to enabling our rational engagement with the world.


### 01-Receptivity is not passivity_ A comparison between psychoanalysis and phenomenology concerning

Title: Receptivity is not passivity: A comparison between psychoanalysis and phenomenology concerning experience, judgement, and the analytic attitude

Author: Heinz Weiss

Journal: The International Journal of Psychoanalysis (Volume 104, Issue 5, pp. 886-897)

Overview:

This article explores the concepts of "passivity" and "receptivity" in phenomenology and psychoanalysis, focusing on their implications for experience, judgement, and the analytic attitude. The author, Heinz Weiss, compares these two perspectives while highlighting their shared understanding that receptivity is not passive but rather a form of rudimentary ego-activity.

Key Points:

1. Edmund Husserl's Experience and Judgement:
Husserl describes pre-predicative experience as an active stance, where the Ego turns towards the object, ending with apprehension through contact. Receptivity, in phenomenology, is a primary form of ego-activity that involves interest in the world and readiness to let something in.

2. Sigmund Freud's Psychoanalysis:
Freud emphasizes the role of projective and introjective processes rooted in bodily experiences and unconscious phantasy. The primitive Ego oscillates between activity (taking in) and passivity (pushing away), which can be seen as a form of permanent oscillation between projective and introjective processes.

3. Parallels between phenomenology and psychoanalysis:
Both perspectives recognize the importance of affection and emotional engagement in human experience, with Husserl acknowledging the primacy of pre-predicative perception as containing primary knowledge of the world. In psychoanalysis, projective and introjective identifications are essential for understanding unconscious intersubjectivity.

4. Experience and judgement in the analytic situation:
Psychoanalysis, often understood as a "listening cure," involves receptive qualities, such as free associations, evenly suspended attention, and listening to inner experiences. The analyst's counter-transference plays a crucial role in taking in, transforming, and responding to the projections of the patient.

5. Receptivity, empathy, curiosity, and creative imagination:
Receptivity is a passive but active experience that allows for understanding and taking in new experiences. Empathy is essential for analysts, enabling them to comprehend patients' feelings without being overwhelmed. Curiosity represents the analytic desire for knowledge, which drives exploration and search for meaning. Creative imagination combines receptivity with active understanding, leading to interpretations that foster psychic development.

6. The shift between receptive and active attitudes:
Weiss argues that proper judgement in the analytic situation requires oscillation between receptive and active-explorative attitudes. This dynamic reflects Husserl's idea that receptive experience is not passive, and genuine cognitive interest involves voluntary participation of the Ego to know the object fully.

7. Complementarity of phenomenology and psychoanalysis:
The author suggests that phenomenological and psychoanalytic approaches can enrich each other through mutual learning, particularly regarding receptivity, empathy, curiosity, and creative imagination in the analytic attitude.

In summary, Heinz Weiss's article examines the similarities and differences between phenomenology and psychoanalysis concerning the notions of passivity and receptivity. By comparing these perspectives, the author highlights the importance of receptive experience in both sciences, emphasizing its active nature and its role in enabling understanding and judgement within the analytic situation. The paper concludes by suggesting that phenomenological and psychoanalytical approaches can learn from each other to deepen their mutual understanding.

### 02-A Phenomenology of Limits_ On the Decolonzing Reduction as a Method of Critical Phenomenology

The article "A Phenomenology of Limits: On the Decolonizing Reduction as a Method of Critical Phenomenology" by Martina Ferrari explores how phenomenology, particularly its method, must confront coloniality's influence to develop a truly critical approach. The author argues for a radicalized phenomenological method called "decolonizing reduction."

1. **Phenomenology and Coloniality**: Phenomenology, as a transcendental project, aims to suspend the natural attitude to examine conditions of possibility for experience. However, coloniality, with its historical and contingent structures of power, poses challenges. It functions not just as a set of empirical conditions but also as a transcendental structure that shapes meaning, being, and the phenomenal fields along racial lines.

2. **Decolonizing Reduction**: Ferrari proposes the decolonizing reduction to address these issues. This method involves:
   - **Hyper-Reflection**: Engaging in a deep, ongoing examination of the transcendental field's oblivion and resistance, which reveals latent conditions of possibility. It acknowledges phenomenology's own shadow or opacity and seeks to unveil hidden aspects of reality.
   - **Secondary Passivity**: Attending to the openness and absences inherent in phenomena, allowing for an exploration of colonial ontological schemas. This approach reveals what is not directly perceived but indirectly present in the style or modulation of appearances.

3. **Critique vs Abandonment**: Ferrari argues that critical phenomenology does not need to abandon phenomenology or transition into post-phenomenology for social critique. Instead, it should radically revise its method to better account for colonial normative structures' constitutive force.

4. **Decolonizing the Phenomenological Method**: The decolonizing reduction, by addressing phenomenology's limits and engaging with secondary passivity, seeks to denaturalize colonial ontological assumptions that shape experiences deemed transcendental. It generates alternative conditions of experience or "grammars of listening," enabling the phenomenological project to reassess its grounding in coloniality.

5. **Methodological Implications**: The decolonizing reduction involves questioning established norms, challenging unquestioned assumptions, and tracking their operations at the ontological level. This method reveals residues or reminders that are not "exactly adjusted" to consciousness, helping phenomenology bear its colonial shadow by making visible the latent content of its and transcendental structures' assumptions.

6. **Historical Context**: By contextualizing this debate within the historical formation of coloniality, Ferrari highlights how phenomenology's canonical method falls short at bracketing ontological commitments shaping conditions of possibility for experience deemed transcendental due to its own historical and cultural nature. Colonial violence undermines structures of experience crucial for making colonial trauma experiences legible within the phenomenological framework.

In summary, Ferrari argues that a truly critical phenomenology must radicalize its method by engaging with its limits in light of coloniality's influence. The decolonizing reduction offers a path forward, emphasizing hyper-reflection and secondary passivity to reveal and challenge normative ontological schemas constitutive of colonial experiences.


The text discusses the limitations of traditional phenomenology, particularly in relation to understanding coloniality (a term that refers to the ongoing historical, cultural, and epistemological effects of colonialism). The author argues that coloniality is not merely a social construct or cultural practice, but is also embedded at a deeper level within structures of consciousness. This naturalization makes it challenging for phenomenology to recognize and critique coloniality because the very operations that seek to bracket (suspend) colonial influences are shaped by these same influences.

The author introduces the concept of "colonial traumatic violence" as proposed by María Acosta López, which posits that coloniality is a form of trauma that undermines conditions of possibility for experience and sense-making. Trauma, in this context, resists integration into consciousness, leading to an unlocatable original event and the erasure of its traces. This results in the establishment of such violence as definite precisely because of its inaccessibility.

The author then discusses how this formulation of coloniality as traumatic violence presents specific challenges for phenomenology. Trauma disrupts traditional structures of experience, making it difficult to communicate or even conceptualize within standard frameworks. Moreover, the very methods used to investigate experiences (like archival research) may implicitly rely on normative structures that colonial violence has already normalized and rendered inaudible or unintelligible.

To address these challenges, the author proposes a "decolonizing reduction" as an alternative method for phenomenology. This approach doesn't attempt to return to originating conditions but instead focuses on the failures of classical methods—the residues and gaps that are not easily adjusted to consciousness. It involves de-prioritizing consciousness as constitutive of experience, developing methods of secondary passivity (tracking the intertwining of others' experiences with one's own), and attending to the failures of reflexion to perceive what escapes while conditioning its own reflection.

The author illustrates this decolonizing reduction through Frantz Fanon's work, particularly his book "Black Skin, White Masks" and essay "This is the Voice of Algeria." Fanon employs a sociogenic phenomenological approach that reveals how social world structures impact meaning and identities while also examining how individual experiences relate to broader societal institutions. By exposing failures in colonial structures, Fanon institutes novel conditions of possibility for sense-making at the site of colonial trauma.

In essence, a decolonizing reduction aims to critique and disrupt colonial norms embedded within phenomenological methodology by attending to its "failures" or overlooked aspects. This approach emphasizes listening to the "absence" of sense generated by coloniality rather than trying to resolve this opacity through established epistemic frameworks, which might dismiss or distort these experiences. It advocates for a phenomenology that is normative and praxical—working towards abolition rather than reparation within the existing world order.


### 02-Altered States of Consciousness during Exercise_ Active-Alert Hypnosis_ and Everyday Waking St

Title: Altered States of Consciousness during Exercise, Active-Alert Hypnosis, and Everyday Waking State

Authors: Eniko Kasos, Krisztian Kasos, Emese Józsa, Katalin Varga, Éva Bányai, András Költő, and Attila Szabó

Journal: International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis

Year: 2022

Summary:

This retrospective study aimed to compare the states of consciousness experienced during exercise (solitary running and spinning classes), active-alert hypnosis (AAH), and everyday waking state. The study involved 375 participants, divided into four groups: runners (n=54), spinners (n=36), AAH participants (n=26), and an awake control group (n=259). Participants completed the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI) to assess their subjective experiences related to altered states of consciousness.

Key findings:

1. Runners, spinners, and AAH participants scored higher on the altered experience and altered state of awareness dimensions of the PCI compared to the control group, indicating a greater likelihood of experiencing alterations in consciousness during exercise or hypnosis.

2. Runners scored significantly higher than AAH participants and the control condition on the rationality dimension, suggesting that running might maintain clear thinking better than hypnosis. In contrast, spinners did not differ significantly from the control group in this regard.

3. The self-awareness dimension was lowest for the AAH group, implying that during hypnosis, participants tend to lose awareness of themselves more than in other conditions (running, spinning, or waking state).

4. Volitional control scores were significantly lower for the AAH group compared to the spinning and waking control groups, which is consistent with the expected reduced sense of agency during hypnosis. Runners did not differ significantly from the AAH group in this regard, suggesting that solitary running might involve a similar loss of perceived control as hypnosis.

Conclusion:

The study suggests that exercise can lead to states of consciousness similar to active-alert hypnosis, possibly increasing responsiveness to training suggestions or coaching input. These findings provide a basis for further research into the potential benefits of employing more conscious suggestive techniques in sports and potentially other fields where altered states of consciousness could be advantageous. However, limitations such as non-randomized group assignments and retrospective recall should be considered when interpreting these results. Future studies are recommended to use a more robust methodology for data collection and address the hypnotizability and motivation levels of participants involved in exercise activities.


Title: Altered States of Consciousness During Exercise, Active-Alert Hypnosis, and Daily Waking State

Authors: Eniko Kasos, Krisztian Kasos, Emese Józsa, Katalin Varga, Éva Bányai, András Költő, and Attila Szabó

Summary: This retrospective study compared the states of consciousness in athletes (runners and spinning class participants) with individuals undergoing Active-Alert Hypnosis (AAH) and university students serving as a control group. A total of 375 participants completed the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI).

Key Findings:
1. Runners, spinning class participants, and AAH subjects scored higher than the control group on altered experience and altered state of awareness dimensions of the PCI. This suggests that exercise and AAH can induce similar changes in consciousness.
2. Runners scored higher than AAH participants and the control group on rationality (dimension related to logical thinking).
3. Spinning class participants scored higher than AAH participants on volitional control (dimension involving deliberate control of thoughts and attention), while both spinning class and control groups had significantly higher scores in this dimension compared to runner and AAH groups.
4. The AAH group obtained the lowest score on self-awareness, indicating a reduced conscious awareness during hypnosis.

Implications: These results suggest that exercise may lead to states of consciousness similar to those experienced during active-alert hypnosis, potentially enhancing athletes' receptivity to coaches' instructions or suggestions. The study underscores the potential benefits of incorporating mindfulness and altered states of consciousness in sports training for optimizing performance.

Methodology:
This retrospective study involved non-randomized comparisons between three groups (runners, spinning class participants, and AAH subjects) and a control group (university students). The researchers used the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI), which measures various aspects of conscious experience.

The PCI consists of factors like altered experience, perception, meaning, time sense, positive affect, negative affect, visual imagery, attention, self-awareness, altered state of awareness, internal dialogue, rationality, volitional control, memory, and arousal. Each factor contains multiple items that participants rate on a Likert scale to indicate the extent to which they experience these phenomena during specific states of consciousness (exercise, AAH, or daily waking state).

The results showed significant differences among groups in several dimensions of the PCI, supporting the authors' hypothesis about the potential similarities between exercise-induced and hypnotically induced altered states of consciousness. Further research is needed to explore these findings and their practical applications for sports psychology and training methods.

### 02-Neurophenomenology_ an integrated approach to exploring awe and wonder1

Title: Neurophenomenology: An Integrated Approach to Exploring Awe and Wonder1

Authors: Lauren Reinerman-Jones, Brandon Sollins, Shaun Gallagher & Bruce Janz

Journal: South African Journal of Philosophy

Year: 2013

Summary:

This study aimed to investigate the experience of awe and wonder in a simulated space travel scenario using a neurophenomenological method. The researchers sought to understand these complex states of experience by integrating psychological, neuroscientific, and philosophical approaches. 

Background:
Astronauts often report feelings of awe and wonder during their time in space. While previous research has focused on other aspects of space travel, such as crew cohesion and medical implications, this study aimed to delve into the experiential side of space exploration. 

Approaches to Studying Experience:
1. Psychological methods rely on self-report questionnaires, which are practical but can be subjective and influenced by participant biases. 
2. Neuroscience methods use psychophysiological systems that record metabolic and electrical signals from the body. These systems offer advantages like objectivity and real-time data processing, yet they can be complex to interpret due to a large number of dependent variables.
3. Phenomenological methods involve interviews to understand an individual's unique perspective on their experience. They provide rich first-person data but are difficult to analyze and prone to subjective limitations. 

To overcome the limitations of each approach, the researchers employed a neurophenomenological method that combines these disciplines: 
- Psychological methods (self-report questionnaires)
- Neuroscientific methods (electroencephalography - EEG, electrocardiography - ECG, functional near-infrared spectroscopy - fNIRS)
- Phenomenological methods (phenomenological interviews)

Investigating Awe and Wonder in a Space Environment:
The study's context was experiences during space travel. To elicit feelings of awe, participants viewed Earth from a simulated mixed-reality spacecraft. This paradigm differs from previous research that used meditation to trigger AW states, potentially leading to different neural responses (e.g., increased activity in the occipital cortex due to visual stimuli).

Method:
17 university students participated in the study, which was designed using a repeated-measures design presenting participants with an Earth view and a Deep Space view lasting 12 minutes each. 

Participants completed various questionnaires before and after viewing the simulated space scenarios to assess psychological traits and states related to AW experiences. Simultaneously, EEG, ECG, and fNIRS were used to record participants' physiological responses during the simulations. Phenomenological interviews were conducted post-experimentation to explore each participant's experience in detail.

Results:
Traditional analyses revealed that:
1. Awe and wonder were more prevalent during the Earth view than Deep Space view (as reported by participants).
2. Non-experiencers of AW showed higher levels of theta activity in both left and right hemispheres compared to experiencers of AW, during the Earth scenario only. 
3. Non-experiencers of AW reported higher experiential comforting faith and private religious practices on the BMMRS compared to experiencers of AW during the Earth scenario. 

Individual Differences Analysis:
Two participants (25 and 30) who experienced different levels of awe were selected for in-depth examination through phenomenological interviews, EEG, ECG, and fNIRS data analysis. The results highlighted differences in brain activity patterns between experiencers and non-experiencers of AW during the simulated Earth view.

Conclusion:
This study demonstrated the effectiveness of neurophenomenology as an integrated interdisciplinary approach to explore complex states of experience, such as awe and wonder. By combining psychological, neuroscientific, and philosophical methods, researchers can better understand these experiences and their neural underpinnings. The findings also revealed that AW during simulated space travel is more likely elicited by the Earth view than Deep Space view.


Title: Physiological Markers of Awe (AW) Experiences During a Virtual Earth View Simulation

The study explores the physiological markers associated with experiences of awe during a virtual Earth view simulation, comparing those who experience awe (experiencers) and those who do not (non-experiencers). Electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) were used to measure brain activity, heart rate variability (HRV), and cerebral blood oxygenation levels.

Key Findings:
1. Greater left hemisphere theta and right hemisphere theta were found among non-experiencers compared to experiencers during the Earth condition. This suggests that non-experiencers experienced greater drowsiness, as increased theta in these regions has been interpreted as representing drowsiness or fatigue.
2. Experiencers of awe showed elevated beta activity from baseline during the Earth view, indicating greater attention, alertness, and arousal compared to non-experiencers. This is consistent with meditation-induced awe experiences. The occipital lobe and right/left hemisphere beta changes indicate more visual, spatial, and motion activation due to perceiving the Earth view compared to Deep Space (DS) view.
3. The minute-by-minute analysis of the experiencer revealed trends similar to those reported in vigilance literature, suggesting that pre-existing expectations or motivation might influence awe experiences. To avoid vigilance-like responses, future studies should consider reducing task time when visual modality is the primary input for participants, especially within simulation environments.
4. The results indicated that the Earth view is more engaging than the DS view, as more Awe statements were made about the Earth view in phenomenological scoring. This aligns with Keltner and Haidt's (2003) model of awe, which suggests greater difficulty accommodating vast scenes into current mental structures.
5. The experiencer showed greater variance in changes from baseline and sharper changes throughout the Earth view simulation compared to the non-experiencer. Specifically, the frontal and occipital lobes exhibited increased beta activity immediately following the start of the Earth view for the experiencer, highlighting the role of emotional and visual centers of the brain in experiencing awe.
6. Pre-existing beliefs might influence awe experiences, as demonstrated by differences in Experiential Comforting Faith (ECF) and Private Religious Practices (PRP) subscales between AW experiencers and non-experiencers during the Earth view. This suggests that space-related awe experiences can occur independently of religiosity, aligning with Keltner and Haidt's model of awe.
7. The neurophenomenological method was found to be beneficial in exploring awe experiences within a virtual environment. Future research should further investigate the impact of visual stimuli on awe experiences by parsing them from the rest of the environment, which could help better understand the role of only the visual simulation in eliciting such responses.

In conclusion, this study provides insights into the physiological and psychological aspects of experiencing awe within a virtual Earth view simulation, highlighting the importance of considering factors like pre-existing beliefs, task duration, and visual stimuli in future research on AW experiences.


### 02-Phenomenology of Joint Attention

Edith Stein's phenomenological description of empathy, which is the intentional mental state where one is directly aware of another person, focuses on how we perceive other persons as lived bodies (Leib), rather than just physical objects (Körper). This distinction lies in recognizing that a lived body shares features with other physical objects like position and extension in space, but also has unique characteristics such as being a sensory field, zero-point of orientation, expressive field, and self-moving.

Stein argues that when we perceive another person, we don't just see their physical attributes but are aware of them as intentional beings engaged in actions or experiencing emotions. This involves recognizing the person's capacity for sensory experiences (like touching a table), orientation (seeing objects relative to the body), expressiveness (detecting emotional states from facial expressions and posture), and autonomy (observing their intentionality in movement initiation).

A key difference between perceiving physical objects and other persons lies in the horizon of perception. For physical objects, there are aspects that may never be properly perceived due to their finite nature – for instance, the underside of a coffee cup can't be seen from above without manipulation. In contrast, while some features of other people might initially be improperly perceived (e.g., their inner thoughts), it's theoretically possible to originary-present these mental processes given appropriate conditions (like observing body language and context).

However, unlike physical objects, persons have inherent features that can never be directly accessed through our senses – namely, their mental states or processes. Despite this limitation, Stein contends that we do have direct perceptual access to other persons as intentional beings. This means that we are not merely inferring the existence of thought in others based on observed similarities with ourselves but are non-inferentially aware of other living, thinking beings engaged in actions and experiences.

In summary, Stein's phenomenology of empathy posits that perceiving another person involves more than just recognizing their physical attributes; it encompasses an understanding of them as sensory, oriented, expressive, autonomous intentional beings whose mental states remain inaccessible to direct observation. This nuanced perspective on interpersonal perception highlights the complexity and richness of our capacity for social cognition.


The passage discusses the philosophical concepts of empathy and joint attention from the perspectives of Edith Stein and Alfred Schutz. It highlights how these philosophers view empathy as a form of noesis (mental act) that can be iterative, meaning it can involve multiple levels or orders.

Stein introduces the term "Einfühlung," often translated as "empathy," which she believes allows for co-originarity—the recognition of another's mental state without being able to directly access it firsthand. Schutz, on the other hand, prefers the term "Thou-orientation" and focuses on what he calls the 'face-to-face situation,' where two or more individuals mutually perceive each other as lived bodies.

Schutz identifies a key aspect of this face-to-face relationship as the 'pure We-relationship,' which involves not just awareness of another's presence but also knowledge that the other is aware of oneself. This reciprocity entails multiple orders of empathy: first-order empathy (direct perception), second-order empathy (empathizing with someone else's empathy), third-order empathy (empathizing with someone else's empathy for you), and so on ad infinitum.

The author then proposes an analytical framework to represent this structure symbolically, using subscripts to distinguish one’s own noeses from those of others, and introducing a notation to indicate self-referential acts of empathy. The 'pure We-relationship' is posited as present when one's empathic act explicates another person's empathic act without limit.

The passage also addresses critiques of Schutz’s theory, particularly from David Carr, who argues that Schutz overlooks the necessity of a shared object or intention in face-to-face situations to constitute a 'pure We-relationship.' The author acknowledges this as a valid point, noting that while Schutz focuses on other-affecting actions, joint attention often involves shared focus on a common object.

Finally, the author proposes an adjusted analysis of joint attention that incorporates both Schutz's pure We-relationship and the need for a shared object: 

(12) P1(α) & E1(P2(α)  & E2(N1)), where (P1(α) & E1(P2(α)  & E2(N1))) explicates (N1).

This suggests that consciousness of a shared object (α) is constituted by one’s perception of the object, along with mutual empathic acts where each person's act of perceiving is explicated within the other's understanding of the situation. 

Potential objections to this analysis include its seeming incompatibility with human cognitive limitations (objection a) and its complexity (objection b). The author acknowledges these concerns but does not directly address them, leaving room for further philosophical debate on the topic.


The paper by Timothy Martell titled "Phenomenology of Joint Attention" presents a novel analysis of joint attention using insights from phenomenological philosophers such as Husserl, Stein, and Schutz. The author argues that understanding joint attention requires recognizing its complex intentional structure.

The central claim is that when two individuals jointly attend to an object (P1(α)), it involves not just perception but also a mutual awareness of each other's intentional states (E1(P2(α)) and E2(N1)). Here, 'P' denotes perception, 'E' signifies empathy or understanding the other's mental state, 'N' represents the noetic aspect (the object as it appears in consciousness), and numbers 1 and 2 indicate different orders of these processes. 

Martell asserts that for joint attention to occur, each participant must be aware of their own perception being perceived by another—an act he refers to as 'second-order empathy.' This leads to a potentially infinite regress of higher-order empathic acts, suggesting no upper limit to the order of these mental processes constitutive of joint attention.

The author addresses potential objections: 

1. **Infinite Order Intentional States**: Martell acknowledges that some might find it problematic for finite minds to entertain intentional states of infinite order. However, he argues that Husserl's theory of internal time—where each moment of present awareness is part of a series of retentions and protensions extending into the past and future—also involves such an infinite regress. Thus, if phenomenologists reject the proposed structure of joint attention on these grounds, they would need to reject much of Husserl's broader theory of intentionality as well.

2. **Complexity Objection**: Some might view this analysis as overly complex, suggesting that only second- or third-order empathy is necessary for joint attention. Martell counters this by demonstrating through logical reasoning that if one takes another to be jointly attending (which is a prerequisite for actual joint attention), then one must also be aware of their awareness of one's own awareness, and so on ad infinitum.

Martell concludes by noting several open questions raised by this phenomenological account, including its applicability to cognitive development and the need for clearer rules governing inferential relations within these intentional structures. He also calls for a formal system to represent and analyze such complex intentional states, which is beyond the scope of the current paper.

The paper contributes significantly to phenomenological discussions on social interaction and cognition, offering a nuanced account of joint attention that goes beyond simplistic models often found in both psychology and philosophy. It underscores the importance of recognizing the mutual awareness and empathy involved when people direct their attention towards shared objects or experiences.


### 02-Phenomenology of contingency_ Reflections on More_s African phenomenology

Mabogo More's concept of contingency is central to his African existential phenomenology. He draws on Jean-Paul Sartre's philosophy to develop this concept, which operates in two realms: existence (non-necessity) and the body (non-essentiality).

1. Contingency of Existence: More understands contingency as non-necessary or non-essential, referring to properties without which a thing could still be what it is. In Sartre's philosophy, this translates into the idea that existence is without inherent justification or necessity. The human condition, according to Sartre, is one of being "thrown" into the world (thrownness) without choice or reason for our circumstances, including race, gender, and physical attributes. This realization can lead to feelings of meaninglessness and nihilism. However, it also implies freedom, as consciousness is intentionally structured to be free and make choices about how to understand and live within these contingent conditions.

2. Contingency of the Body: More argues that our bodily existence is also contingent. While it's necessary to be a body, the specific properties of one's body (e.g., race, gender, height) are not determined by choice or reason. This contingency manifests in three dimensions:

   a. First-personal experience: Our bodies define our individual consciousness and situate us in the world. However, we are free to transcend this facticity through intentional acts. Denying this freedom is an act of "bad faith," as it leads to self-deception about one's ability to change circumstances or create meaning.

   b. Body of others: The body of another person designates possibilities for lived engagement in practical situations like work, even when the other isn't physically present. The body of another is contingent because it could be elsewhere and possesses the power to escape objectification. It's not fixed or essential but rather dynamic and subject to change based on circumstances and interactions.

   c. Body seen by others: The "look" of the Other reveals our being-as-object, objectifying us in ways we didn't choose. This experience can lead to shame, embarrassment, or pride, depending on how we internalize the look. More uses Frantz Fanon's example of a white boy observing him (Fanon) on a train to illustrate how black bodies are often collectively objectified in anti-black societies.

More distinguishes between "absolute contingency" and "relative contingency." Absolute contingency implies that existence is meaningless and without justification, while relative contingency acknowledges the necessity of existence for the perpetuation of life (e.g., a mother's necessity to her child). More's concept of contingency serves as an existential concern—a matter of life and death—because denying or distorting our contingent existence can lead to serious issues like racism, sexism, and misogyny. By embracing contingency, individuals can create meaning in their lives and resist oppressive ideologies that deny their freedom and dignity.


Mabogo P. More's philosophical work revolves around the concept of contingency, particularly as it pertains to race and racism, specifically anti-black racism. His approach is rooted in phenomenology, which focuses on the study of structures of experience and consciousness.

1. Contingency and Existential Concern: More argues that bodily existence is contingent, meaning it lacks essential or predetermined qualities. This aligns with Jean-Paul Sartre's notion that "existence precedes essence," suggesting humans exist before they have a fixed nature or purpose. However, More adds that despite this non-essentiality of the body, consciousness constantly surpasses these bodily relations, allowing for new ways of relating to oneself and others.

2. The Black Question: More introduces Frantz Fanon's question - "Is there a black mode of being-in-the-world?" This is known as the 'Black question'. He acknowledges that while all humans share common human experiences (birth, death, hunger, desire for sleep, joy, sadness), the modes of experiencing these are different due to racialization. 

3. Phenomenology of Difference: More advocates for an 'existentialist phenomenology of difference', which involves suspending habitual ways of seeing and doing, as per Husserl's method of bracketing. This approach aims to explore what it means to be black in the world rather than merely describing what a black person is. 

4. Contingency and Racism: In an anti-black racist society, More asserts that Black individuals are denied consciousness and thus freedom due to being reduced to 'brute Being', objectified and devoid of the capacity for self-justification. The contingent nature of existence is exploited here; blackness becomes an illegitimate presence requiring justification from those in power, leading to systemic racism.

5. Ontological Strategy: More suggests that combating racism begins with ontological solutions or 'radical conversion', a process of self-recovery from a corrupted consciousness that denies freedom. This involves recognizing the contingency of our situation and embracing our capacity to change it, even in seemingly inescapable circumstances.

6. Moral Solutions: While ontology can reveal what should not be the case (like racism), it cannot dictate ethical precepts directly. Thus, More proposes moral solutions grounded in a 'concrete ethics' that addresses uneven playing fields of oppression rather than abstract, idealized conditions. This requires acknowledging limitations and accepting 'dirty hands', i.e., the possibility of immoral actions (like violence) if they are necessary to effect change.

7. Political Strategies: Although not extensively detailed in this summary, More's work implies a transition from ontological considerations to political strategies for liberation. This move involves translating ontological insights into practical political decisions and commitments aimed at altering oppressive structures. 

In essence, Mabogo P. More's philosophy offers an African phenomenological perspective that interrogates contingency and its role in anti-black racism. His work underscores the importance of understanding our existence as always subject to change, advocating for a radical reconceptualization of our relationship with freedom, morality, and politics within racist societies.


### 03-Disruptions of the Meshed Architecture in Autism Spectrum Disorder

The article "Disruptions of the Meshed Architecture in Autism Spectrum Disorder" by Shaun Gallagher, Laura Sparaci, and Somogy Varga explores how the meshed architecture model from performance studies can provide insights into social cognition and its disruptions in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

The authors propose a broad view of social cognition that includes embodied and situated processes such as nonverbal cues, joint attention, joint action, social affordances, and direct enactive perception of intentions and affective states. They argue against the traditional theory of mind (ToM) approach to social cognition, which focuses on individual mindreading mechanisms, in favor of an embodied-situated conception that involves intersubjective interaction.

The meshed architecture model from performance studies is introduced as a framework to understand social cognition and its disruptions in ASD. This model integrates cognitive and embodied motoric processes, with a hierarchical division of control responsibilities where cognitive control guides strategic aspects of performance, while automatic processes handle implementation. The authors enhance this model by incorporating four key elements:

1. A complex conception of cognition: This includes variations on thoughtful, heedful processes like self-reflective thinking, planning, predicting, deliberation, selective target control, and prereflective awareness.
2. Intrinsic control: The authors argue that motor control processes are not entirely automatic but can be situation-specific, adaptive, and highly dynamical. This implies that control is intrinsic to the body's ability to respond intelligently to familiar or unfamiliar situations.
3. Affective processes: These modulate the dynamics of integration on both vertical (cognitive-motor) and horizontal axes, shaping our ability to cope with the environment and other agents.
4. Horizontal axis: This includes relations with artifacts, instruments, established practices, and social partners, emphasizing the importance of distributed cognition and material engagement theory in understanding performance.

The authors apply this enhanced meshed architecture model to social cognition, focusing on developmental psychology and intersubjective conversation. They analyze everyday social interactions, such as conversation, using Charles Goodwin's conversation analysis to illustrate the dynamic integration of various semiotic resources, embodied aspects, ecological factors, and normative elements within the mesh.

Lastly, the authors discuss how this model can be applied to understanding ASD. They highlight that problems with intersubjective interactions in people with ASD may not solely result from high-level cognitive impairments in ToM but could also stem from sensory-motor anomalies and delays in motor development, which impact the acquisition of social milestones. The meshed architecture model can help capture important conceptual links between various factors affecting social interactions in ASD, including artifacts, instruments, established practices, and other people.

In conclusion, this article provides a nuanced perspective on social cognition and its disruptions in ASD by integrating embodied-situated processes within the meshed architecture model. The authors suggest that future research should focus on understanding dynamical relations among factors to develop a more comprehensive explanation of social cognitive problems in ASD.


The provided text discusses various aspects of social cognition, with a particular focus on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It explores how our ability to perceive, interpret, and predict others' actions is influenced by our own movements, and suggests that individuals with ASD may encounter specific difficulties in these mechanisms.

One key concept introduced is "vitality forms," which refers to the dynamics of perceived action style in everyday interactions conveying relevant information. Research indicates that children with ASD often struggle with recognizing vitality forms, which could impact their social skill learning. This difficulty may be rooted in problems with proprioceptive sensory feedback, motoric behavior, and purposeful actions from infancy, potentially disrupting nonverbal aspects of conversation.

The text also delves into language development in children with ASD, noting potential delays or absences in speech, various prosodic idiosyncrasies, word/phrase repetition, echolalia, and irregularities in pitch and intonation of speech. Some children with ASD may never develop speech, while others who have words might not engage in conversation. High-functioning individuals with ASD may also fail to reach typical communicative speech or pragmatics despite having language abilities.

Studies reveal that children with ASD often struggle with initiating and maintaining topics during conversations. For instance, Tager-Flusberg and Anderson (1991) found that while increased language ability in children with Down syndrome correlated with improved conversational skills, this was not the case for children with ASD. Hadwin et al. (1997) attempted to improve conversational abilities in children with ASD by training them on tasks involving Theory of Mind (ToM), focusing on beliefs, emotional states, and pretense. However, they observed no improvement in conversation development or the use of mental state terms in speech after such training.

The text further discusses affect as a crucial element within the meshed architecture of conversation. Problems with intersubjective or relational affect in ASD can lead to significant disruptions in social engagement, alongside sensory-motor process anomalies and developmental delays involving purposeful actions (object exploration and functional actions) starting from infancy. These factors could have cascading effects on later language development.

In conclusion, understanding social cognition and its impairments in ASD requires considering multiple interconnected factors within the meshed architecture of conversation, including verbal accomplishment of thought, affective dimension, sensory-motor processes, and purposeful actions. The model presented suggests that these elements dynamically interact, with disruptions along both vertical (verbal) and horizontal axes potentially causing impairments in social cognition and interaction for individuals with ASD. 

Further research may involve using dynamical systems models to specify the relations structuring various factors forming temporary coherent systems during intersubjective interactions, capturing underlying processes that define ways of being-in-the-world. This approach moves away from traditional intellectualist conceptions of mindreading and methodological individualism, aiming for a more holistic understanding of social cognition in ASD.

### 03-Occupational Science and Phenomenology_ Human Activity_ Narrative and Ethical Responsibility

Michael D. Barber's article, "Occupational Science and Phenomenology: Human Activity, Narrative and Ethical Responsibility," published in the Journal of Occupational Science (2004), explores the potential contributions of phenomenology to understanding occupation as purposeful human activity.

Phenomenology is a philosophical approach developed by Edmund Husserl, focusing on how individuals subjectively experience their world and actions. Phenomenologists employ a reflective stance called the "phenomenological reduction," which involves bracketing assumptions about how things are and instead attending closely to how they appear. This method allows for a fresh, unprejudiced examination of everyday experiences, enabling researchers to discover essential features of human activity, action, and intersubjective encounters.

Barber highlights three significant areas in which phenomenology contributes to occupational science: human activity, narrative, and ethical responsibility.

1. Human Activity: Phenomenologists view human activity as intentional, meaning it is directed toward the world rather than merely deliberate or purposeful. Two notable phenomenologists have explored this theme—Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Alfred Schutz. Merleau-Ponty examined operational intentionality, arguing that there is a form of bodily knowing that goes beyond intellectual reflection. Examples include learning to ride a bicycle or maintaining balance without conscious planning. Schutz developed the concept of intentionality of action, which involves conscious deliberation and planning. For instance, when pursuing a project (e.g., knitting a sweater), one imagines it as already completed, with sub-actions guided by this overarching purpose or "in-order-to" motive.

2. Narrative: Phenomenologists recognize narrative as the regular method of commonsense self-explanation. Recovering past motives correlative to future-oriented purposes is essential for understanding how individuals engage in occupations. Paul Ricoeur has spelled out the properties of life-narratives, which can help clarify how people make sense of their experiences and actions over time.

3. Ethical Responsibility: Phenomenology can shed light on ethical responsibility through Emmanuel Levinas's description of how another person summons us to respond to their needs and concerns. This perspective highlights the face-to-face encounter with others, emphasizing that our actions are influenced by the demands and expectations we perceive in our interactions with other people.

Barber argues that phenomenology complements both natural and social sciences, offering a unique first-person perspective on human experience. This perspective is valuable for occupational science, as it allows researchers to understand not only the neural and physiological underpinnings of activities but also how individuals subjectively experience their world, purposes, and actions. By adopting phenomenological approaches, occupational scientists can gain a more comprehensive understanding of human occupation, narrative, and ethical responsibility.

In summary, Barber's article underscores the importance of phenomenology in occupational science by illustrating how this philosophical framework contributes to clarifying human activity, narrative, and ethical responsibility. Through its emphasis on first-person perspectives and essential features of experiences, phenomenology can enrich our understanding of occupation as purposeful human activity.


This passage by Michael D. Barber discusses the interconnections between phenomenology, narrative, and ethical responsibility as they relate to occupation or human activities. The text is based on Alfred Schutz's phenomenology of everyday life motives and explores how these concepts can be applied to understand occupations.

1. **Operational Intentionality**: This refers to the directed focus one has while performing sub-acts towards a long-term goal, such as reading a book. It involves neural and physiological processes that are not explicitly experienced by the individual but can be explained by neurophysiologists.

2. **Narrative and Occupation**: Schutz's phenomenology includes "because motives" or past-directed reasons that influence present in-order-to projects (goals). These because motives are discovered through an interpretive selection of past events relevant to the present and future. This narrative aspect of occupation is emphasized, but rarely distinguished in occupational science research.

3. **Typifications and Relevances**: As humans, we categorize objects and people (typifications) based on generalizations, which are used within systems of interests or relevances. These relevances guide our actions and can be altered based on changing circumstances. For example, the priority of protecting children from a rabid dog overrides the original purpose of driving to school.

4. **Ethical Responsibility**: Levinas's phenomenology is introduced as a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of intersubjective relationships in occupations. He argues that the mere presence of another person evokes an ethical summons to respond with respect, understanding, or not causing harm. This ethical responsibility shapes various occupations, from dedicated teaching to fostering play with children on their terms.

5. **Narrative and Ethics**: Narratives are inherently tentative, constructed through present self-typifications and relevances, which can change over time. They reflect our interpretations of past events, influencing our identities and future occupational projects. Levinas's ethical responsibility can be seen as a driving force within these narratives, guiding how individuals approach their occupations and respond to ethical demands.

In conclusion, Barber emphasizes the importance of understanding human activities (occupations) through phenomenological concepts like operational intentionality, narrative, and ethical responsibility. By examining these aspects, occupational science can gain a deeper, more nuanced perspective on human engagement with the world.

### 03-Phenomenology_ idealism_ and the legacy of Kant

James Kinkaid's article "Phenomenology, Idealism, and the Legacy of Kant" explores the relationship between Immanuel Kant's philosophy, phenomenology, and idealism, focusing on the interpretations by Martin Heidegger and Edmund Husserl.

1. **Heidegger's Affinity with Kant and Husserl**: Kinkaid begins by noting that in his Winter Semester 1927-28 lectures, Heidegger expresses affinity for both Kant and Husserl. The key question is what elements of Kant's philosophy appear in Heidegger's "Being and Time" (BT), and how the background of Husserl's phenomenology influenced this affirmation.

2. **Blattner's Idealist Interpretation**: William Blattner argues that Heidegger adopts a form of temporal idealism, which corrects inconsistencies in Kantian idealism. According to Blattner, Heidegger's 'dependence passage' (BT 255) suggests that the ontological framework for existence questions depends on Dasein (human existence). This implies generic modal dependence and grounding of physical objects on conscious subjects.

3. **Kinkaid's Realist Alternative**: Kinkaid challenges Blattner's interpretation by presenting a realist alternative, arguing that both Husserl and Heidegger are realists rather than idealists. To do this, he traces a unified philosophical problematic through three key passages:

   - **Schematism Chapter (1st Critique)**: Kinkaid connects the schematism to Husserl's thought experiment of world destruction in "Ideas I." Both discuss how time structures experience and makes enduring objects possible.
   
   - **Thought Experiment of World Destruction (Ideas I)**: Kinkaid interprets this thought experiment realistically, claiming that Husserl modifies the problematic to show how intentional form is necessary for perceiving enduring objects, thus avoiding idealistic consequences.
   
   - **Dependence Passage in Being and Time**: Kinkaid argues that Heidegger's critique of neo-Kantian interpretations suggests agreement with Husserl's critique of Kant, implying a form of realism where physical objects' natures depend on the structure of consciousness, not its existence.

4. **Defining Idealism and Realism**: Kinkaid clarifies his definitions:

   - Idealism: The view that the existence or nature of physical objects stands in a relation of generic modal dependence to conscious subjects.
   - Realism: The denial of idealism; some physical objects' existence or nature depends on no mind.

5. **Husserl's Transcendental Aesthetic**: Kinkaid shows that, despite Husserl's claims about transcendental idealism, a realist interpretation is possible by focusing on his project of mapping the "space of meaning" (Crowell) or clarifying the sense of existence as it manifests in consciousness (Carr). Specifically, Kinkaid highlights Husserl's thought experiment of world destruction as addressing a similar philosophical problem to Kant's Schematism chapter, but interpreted realistically through rethinking the "form" of intentionality.

In summary, James Kinkaid's article argues that both Heidegger and Husserl are realists rather than idealists when it comes to their views on consciousness, time, and objectivity. By tracing connections between key passages in their works and those of Immanuel Kant, Kinkaid presents a nuanced interpretation challenging the common understanding of these philosophers as idealists.


This text is a philosophical analysis discussing Edmund Husserl's and Martin Heidegger's interpretations of Immanuel Kant, particularly focusing on their views regarding the nature of objects and consciousness. The author argues that both Husserl and Heidegger reject idealistic interpretations of Kant's transcendental philosophy, instead adopting realist positions.

1. **Husserl's Phenomenological Realism**: The author contends that Husserl's phenomenology is justified within a theoretic-thematic context rather than a metaphysical one. According to Husserl, the natural attitude presupposes realism without being challenged by his transcendental turn. He asserts that consciousness is absolute in existing without constituting transcendent objects and that the world depends on the structure of consciousness for its givenness. The passage about the dependence of the world on consciousness should be read as a claim about givenness, not ontological dependence.

2. **Husserl's Critique of Kantian Psychologism**: Husserl criticizes Kant for psychologizing form, leading to an interpretation where the natures of material objects are grounded in consciousness' structure. Husserl argues that Kant failed to distinguish pure psychology from transcendental phenomenology and missed the evidence problem due to his misunderstanding of intentionality's essence.

3. **Heidegger's Phenomenological Interpretation of Kant**: Heidegger interprets Kant's Critique of Pure Reason phenomenologically, emphasizing that all thinking serves intuition and rejecting the Marburg neo-Kantian interpretation that blurs the distinction between pure psychology and transcendental phenomenology.

4. **Heidegger's Critique of Kant's Copernican Revolution**: Heidegger criticizes the interpretation of form as 'forming' in Kant, arguing that this understanding leads to misunderstandings and mistakenly reduces objects to subjective activities. Instead, Heidegger interprets space and time as pure forms of intuition corresponding directly to the being-extant-together of objects.

5. **Heidegger's Phenomenological Understanding of Intentional Form**: Heidegger follows Husserl in rethinking intentionality along realist lines, emphasizing that certain kinds of intentional form (such as horizonal intentionality) are essential features of any subject capable of having spatial and temporal objects afforded to it. Objects' existence or natures aren't dependent upon or grounded in the structure of consciousness but are enabled by it.

6. **Heidegger's Rejection of Ontological Idealism**: Contrary to Blattner's interpretation, Heidegger isn't committed to temporal idealism – the notion that time and the temporal structure of things depend on us. Instead, Dasein's temporality is an enabling condition for the appearance of objects that are spatial and temporal independently of any contribution from us.

7. **Moving Beyond Kant**: Heidegger proposes extending Kant's transcendental project to include all possibilities of regional variation and moving beyond ordinary time concepts to those described in Division II of Being and Time, aiming for an ontological analysis that provides grounds for metaphysics.

In conclusion, the author argues for understanding Husserl and Heidegger as realists rather than idealists by highlighting their shared rejection of psychologistic interpretations of Kant's transcendental philosophy and emphasis on horizonal intentionality as essential to affording spatial and temporal objects. By doing so, they avoid attributing the natures or existence of those objects to consciousness' structure, aligning their views more closely with phenomenological realism.

### 03-Statistical physics of inference_ thresholds and algorithms

The article "Statistical physics of inference: thresholds and algorithms" by Lenka Zdeborová and Florent Krzakala, published in Advances in Physics (2016), explores the interdisciplinary field that lies at the intersection of statistical inference and statistical physics. The authors aim to explain how concepts from statistical physics, such as phase transitions, can provide insights into threshold phenomena in data analysis.

The paper begins by highlighting the historical connection between Pierre-Simon Laplace, who contributed significantly to both statistical physics and statistical inference, as well as emphasizing the potential for analogies between these two fields due to their shared focus on large assemblies of small elements (atoms/bits/data points).

The authors introduce the teacher-student scenario, a specific formulation of inference problems where the "teacher" generates data based on some ground truth information and probabilistic models, which the "student" then attempts to infer or recover. This setting is particularly useful in neural networks, where the student aims to learn the rule that the teacher used to generate outputs from given inputs.

In this review, the authors focus on the Bayesian approach within the teacher-student scenario because it allows for an optimal recovery of ground truth and facilitates analysis through statistical physics methods like replica and cavity techniques. The main emphasis is on understanding phase transitions as threshold phenomena in inference problems and developing new algorithms based on these insights.

The article is structured as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Introducing the connection between statistical inference and statistical physics, with a focus on the teacher-student scenario as a transparent setting for this connection. The authors clarify that their primary interest lies in phase transitions and threshold phenomena rather than detailed algorithms or model selection problems.

2. **Statistical Physics and Inference**: This section explains fundamental concepts of statistical physics (e.g., planted ensemble, Nishimori line) in the context of inference problems. The authors discuss how these physics-based techniques can provide insights into the ability to infer ground truth from data.

Throughout the paper, the authors provide a balance between theoretical background and practical implications, making it accessible to readers from both physics and computer science/statistics backgrounds. The main takeaway is that statistical physics can offer valuable insights into understanding the limits of data inference, potentially guiding the development of more efficient algorithms for tackling challenging inference problems in diverse fields like machine learning, signal processing, and network analysis.


Title: Statistical Physics Approach to Inference Problems

1.3. Statistical Physics and Inference

The intersection of statistical physics and inference problems lies in the study of phase transitions and computational complexity. These two fields offer complementary perspectives that enhance our understanding of information recovery from data.

1.3.1. Phase Transitions in Information Theory

Phase transitions, a concept from statistical physics, have been found to be relevant in information theory. In the context of inference problems, a phase transition occurs when there is a sudden change in the feasibility or efficiency of recovering variables (x) from observations (y). 

Two primary types of phase transitions are:

1. **Sufficient Information Threshold (αc):** This is the critical value below which it's impossible for any algorithm to accurately infer x from y, regardless of computational resources. This regime corresponds to insufficient observed information.

2. **Algorithmic Threshold (αs):** Above this threshold, efficient algorithms can successfully recover x, but the hardness of inference increases as α approaches αs from above. 

In many problems, these two thresholds coincide (αc = αs). However, in some cases, there exists an 'easy' regime (α > αs) where both information sufficiency and computational efficiency are met. The primary challenge is to characterize these thresholds precisely and develop efficient algorithms operating near or below αs.

1.3.2. Planted Ensemble Formulation

To bridge the gap between physics and inference, a statistical physics approach often uses the concept of 'planted ensembles.' This method represents an inference problem as a statistical mechanics model with a 'planted' solution—an underlying structure (ground truth) that the system is trying to recover. 

Consider a high-dimensional setting where x represents latent variables, and y are observations. The teacher generates x* from a prior distribution Ptp(x*) and uses it to produce y according to a model likelihood Ptm(y | x*). The student then tries to infer x* using the data y and information about Ptp(x*) and Ptm(y | x*).

In this framework, the inference problem is mapped onto a spin glass or related disordered systems, where the 'spins' (variables) interact via a complex energy landscape determined by the likelihood and prior. The goal is to find the ground state (most probable configuration), which corresponds to the Bayes-optimal solution.

1.3.3. Free Energy and Replica Symmetry Breaking

To analyze these models, statistical physicists often employ the concept of free energy—a measure combining entropy (uncertainty) and energy (likelihood). Minimizing the free energy helps find the most probable configuration (ground state), which corresponds to the Bayes-optimal solution. 

Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) is a technique used to handle the complex, disordered nature of these systems. It involves averaging over multiple replicas of the system to account for its randomness better. RSB can reveal critical points (phase transitions) in the thermodynamic limit (large N), providing insights into information recovery thresholds and algorithmic hardness.

1.3.4. Information Theoretic Metrics

Statistical physics also offers tools to quantify the amount of useful information in observations (y) regarding variables (x). Key metrics include:

1. **Mutual Information (MI):** Measures the reduction in uncertainty about x when y is known. It's a fundamental quantity in information theory, connecting the data-generating process and inference tasks.

2. **Redundancy:** Refers to the amount of extra, non-informative data available beyond what's necessary for accurate inference. High redundancy can hinder efficient learning but also provide robustness against noise or missing observations.

These metrics help characterize the information content of observations and guide the development of efficient inference algorithms.

1.3.5. Algorithmic Hardness and Glassy Phenomena

The statistical physics approach also sheds light on algorithmic hardness in inference problems, linking it to glassy phenomena—complex energy landscapes with numerous local optima. These landscapes can lead to slow convergence or get stuck in suboptimal solutions for standard optimization algorithms. Understanding these challenges paves the way for developing tailored algorithms that overcome such barriers, potentially bridging the gap between theoretical limits and practical solutions.

In summary, statistical physics provides a powerful lens through which to view and analyze inference problems. By framing these tasks as complex energy landscapes governed by phase transitions, it offers insights into information sufficiency, algorithmic efficiency, and fundamental limits of learning from data. The interplay between statistics, information theory, and statistical mechanics continues to drive advancements in both fields, fostering a deeper understanding of how we can effectively recover structure from high-dimensional observations.


The text describes a statistical physics model called the "planted spin glass" (SG) as a paradigm for statistical inference problems. This model is used to study Bayesian inference, particularly in the teacher-student setting introduced earlier. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Planted Spin Glass Model**: The planted SG model starts with N binary variables S*i (spins), each of which can be +1 or -1. A graph G = (V, E) is constructed, where nodes correspond to spins and edges indicate interactions between them. For each edge (ij) ∈ E, a coupling Jij is assigned from a distribution that depends on the planted configuration S*i and S*j. The distribution is given by P(Jij|S*i, S*j) = ρδ(Jij - S*i S*j) + (1-ρ)δ(Jij + S*i S*j), where ρ is a bias in the observations.

2. **Posterior Distribution**: The goal is to infer the planted configuration S* from the observed couplings J, which leads to the posterior probability distribution P(S | J). This distribution turns out to be proportional to the Boltzmann measure of an Ising model at inverse temperature β*: P(S | J) ∝ exp(-β* H(S)), where H(S) is the Hamiltonian of the Ising model.

3. **Nishimori's Mapping**: The text introduces a gauge transformation that allows mapping the inference problem onto a physics problem known as Nishimori's line. This mapping provides insights into the phase diagram and properties of the planted SG. Under this transformation, the inverse temperature β in the Ising model corresponds to the bias ρ in the observation process.

4. **Bayes-Optimal Inference**: When β = β*, the inference problem becomes Bayes-optimal, meaning that the planted configuration can be exchanged (under averages or in the thermodynamic limit) with a random configuration sampled from the posterior probability distribution. This exchangeability implies that all equilibrium configurations share similar macroscopic properties, such as energy and magnetization.

5. **Estimation Goal**: The aim is to find the minimum mismatch estimator (MMO), which in this case corresponds to estimating the spin values based on their equilibrium magnetizations mi in the Ising model.

6. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Monte Carlo methods, such as Metropolis algorithm, can be used to evaluate phase diagrams of Hamiltonians with discrete degrees of freedom, including this planted SG model. The text mentions that an exact solution exists for the mean-field setting via the cavity method but keeps Monte Carlo in mind as a universal tool for studying such problems.

The planted SG model is a powerful tool for understanding and solving complex inference problems by leveraging concepts from statistical physics, particularly the study of spin glasses.


The text discusses the concept of "planting" in the context of statistical physics, optimization problems, and Bayesian inference, particularly focusing on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SG) model, a spin glass model. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Planting and Gauge Transformation**: The text introduces the idea of planting a conﬁguration (S∗) in an Ising model with random interactions (Jij). This process involves generating the couplings Jij according to a probability distribution P(J | S∗), which is then used to define an ensemble of instances (S∗, G, J). The text also mentions a gauge transformation that maps this planted conﬁguration to a ferromagnetic one, preserving the Ising Hamiltonian's structure.

2. **Phase Diagram and Inference**: After applying the gauge transformation, the planted conﬁguration becomes ferromagnetic (all spins up), simplifying the inference problem. The phase diagram of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with a ferromagnetic bias ρ is discussed. This bias corresponds to the fraction of positive couplings (Jij = +1) chosen independently at random. The critical temperature (Tc or βc) separates the undetectable (paramagnetic) phase, where inference is impossible due to lack of information, from the detectable (ferromagnetic) phase, where inference is possible and algorithmically tractable via methods like Monte Carlo sampling.

3. **Nishimori Line**: The Nishimori line (ρ = eβ/(2 cosh β)) plays a crucial role in this context. It corresponds to the condition for Bayes-optimal inference (β = β∗). On this line, several interesting properties, known as Nishimori conditions, hold. These conditions simplify the analysis of the model and its phase transitions.

4. **Parameter Mismatch and Learning**: The text discusses what happens when the true value of β∗ (or equivalently ρ) is unknown. Using an overly high value of β could lead to equilibration problems in the glassy phase, while using too low a value might miss the detectable phase. A natural strategy for learning these parameters involves iteratively imposing Nishimori conditions, which are satisfied only in the Bayes-optimal case.

5. **Relations Between Disorders**: The text clarifies that the notion of the Nishimori line and related properties apply more generally to Bayesian inference problems without requiring a gauge symmetry in the underlying Hamiltonian. It also discusses the relationships between planted disorder, quenched disorder (where couplings are randomly drawn from a fixed distribution), and annealed disorder (where interactions are averaged out).

6. **Quiet Planting**: Quiet planting refers to a situation where the free energy of the system is equal to the annealed free energy, making generating instances from the planted ensemble equivalent to generating from the randomly quenched ensemble. This property simplifies analysis and is particularly advantageous in mean-field systems.

7. **Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB)**: The text explains that RSB, originally developed to understand glasses and spin glasses via calculations like replica symmetry and cavity method, is not necessary for Bayes-optimal inference. However, understanding RSB helps appreciate the results in this context. RSB describes different regimes of equilibrium behavior characterized by varying degrees of non-self-averaging of overlaps between conﬁgurations.

8. **Applications to Glass Studies**: The concept of planting has implications for studying structural glasses in physics, particularly simplifying equilibration and providing insights into glassy phases without needing extensive computational resources. Quiet planting allows for exact equivalence between the planted ensemble and randomly quenched ensemble in certain mean-field systems, further facilitating analysis.


The text discusses the application of the Cavity Method, a powerful tool in statistical physics, particularly for studying spin glass systems. This method is used to compute properties of large random graphs, which locally resemble trees due to their sparse nature.

1. **Random Graphs**: The focus is on Erdős-Rényi (ER) random graphs, characterized by a fixed average degree `c`. These graphs are constructed uniformly at random from the ensemble G(N,M), where N vertices and M edges are specified. Alternatively, one can define G(N,p) with an independent probability `0 < c/N < 1` for each edge to exist between any two nodes. In the sparse limit (`N → ∞`, `c ~ O(1)`, `M ~ N`), these random graphs behave locally like trees.

2. **BP and Cavity Method**: The core of this method involves a Hamiltonian with interactions on edges, as well as prior information about spins at each site. To compute the partition sum (Z) on a tree, the method introduces intermediate variables `Zi→j(Si)` for adjacent sites `i` and `j`. These represent partial partition functions of sub-trees rooted at `i`, excluding branches toward `j`. The recursion equations for these variables are:

   - `Zi→j(Si) = ψi(Si) ∏_(k∈∂i\j) (Sk / Zk→i(Sk) * ψik(Si, Sk))`
   - `Zi(Si) = ψi(Si) ∏_(j∈∂i) (Sj / Zj→i(Sj) * ψij(Si, Sj))`

   Here, `∂i \ j` denotes the set of all neighbors of `i`, excluding `j`. The assumption that neighboring sites' messages are independent on a tree leads to these recursions.

3. **Normalization and Probabilities**: To avoid dealing with potentially exponentially large partition functions, one normalizes these intermediate variables into marginal probability distributions:

   - `ηi→j(Si) = Zi→j(Si) / ∑_S' Zi→j(S')`
   - `ηi(Si) = Zi(Si) / ∑_S' Zi(S')`

4. **Belief Propagation (BP) Equations**: The recursions in terms of marginal probabilities are known as the BP equations:

   - `ηi→j(Si) = ψi(Si) * ∏_(k∈∂i\j) (Sk / ηk→i(Sk) * ψik(Si, Sk))`
   - `ηi(Si) = ψi(Si) * ∏_(j∈∂i) (Sj / ηj→i(Sj) * ψij(Si, Sj))`

   These equations define the BP algorithm, where messages (or "beliefs") are iteratively updated until convergence. The resulting marginal distributions can then be used to compute various quantities of interest.

5. **Free Energy**: The total partition function (Z) and free energy (`fN = -T log Z`) can also be computed using the cavity messages, yielding the so-called "Bethe free energy":

   - `f_i = -T log z_i`
   - `f_{ij} = -T log z_{ij}`

   Here, `z_i` and `z_{ij}` are normalization constants given by recursive relations derived from the BP equations.

6. **Application to Spin Glasses**: This method is applied to study spin glass systems, where a phase transition occurs (glass transition). The BP approach combined with Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) provides an accurate description of such systems under the Nishimori conditions. In the absence of RSB, as in Bayes-optimal inference, the simple BP approach is expected to yield correct results.

7. **Viana-Bray Model**: The method's applicability is demonstrated using the Viana-Bray (V-B) model for diluted spin glasses on ER random graphs. This model serves as a starting point for understanding planted spin glass models by relating their phase diagrams via the Nishimori conditions.


The text discusses the application of spectral methods to solve inference problems, specifically focusing on the planted Ising spin glass (SG) model. The authors present a novel spectral algorithm based on a non-backtracking matrix, which overcomes limitations encountered by conventional approaches using matrices like Jij or its Laplacian.

The motivation for this new method arises from the observation that standard spectral techniques struggle with sparse random graphs due to the presence of localized eigenvectors around high-degree nodes or hanging sub-trees. These localized vectors are insufficient in capturing the global structure necessary for inference tasks.

To address this issue, the authors propose a non-backtracking matrix B defined on directed edges as Bi→j,k→l = Jijδil(1 − δjk). This matrix is designed to mimic the behavior of Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm when departing from the paramagnetic fixed point. The BP linearization around this fixed point, given by Equation (78), inspired the definition of this non-backtracking matrix B.

By using this non-backtracking spectral method, the authors aim to reveal the internal structure of the data in a way that better explains its variance and facilitates inference tasks such as finding configurations correlated with the planted assignment in the planted SG model within the region β∗ > βc where BP can asymptotically perform so. This spectral algorithm offers an alternative approach to tackle inference problems, particularly on sparse graphs where conventional methods may fall short due to localized eigenvectors.


The text discusses the problem of community detection in complex networks, focusing on a statistical physics approach. The goal is to assign nodes into groups (communities) such that edges within communities are more numerous than between them. Traditionally, this problem has been approached using spectral methods, which involve computing the largest or smallest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of graph matrices like adjacency or Laplacian matrices.

A notable method in community detection is based on modularity (Q), proposed by Mark Newman and colleagues. Modularity is a measure that quantifies the strength of division of a network into communities, defined as:

Q = (1/2M) ∑⟨i,j⟩ [Aij - (di * dj)/(2M)] δsi,sj

where Aij are elements of the adjacency matrix, di is the degree of node i, and δsi,sj is the Kronecker delta. The community detection task then becomes finding an assignment that maximizes this modularity function. Although optimizing modularity is NP-hard, various efficient heuristics have been developed to tackle it in practice.

The text highlights a limitation of modularity: its value can be high even on random graphs with no community structure. This issue motivates the pursuit of methods capable of distinguishing between graphs with and without community structures. 

The Sparse Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is introduced as an idealized representation of real-world networks, where nodes belong to communities with given sizes (na), and connections between communities follow a probability matrix cab/N. The task then becomes inferring these parameters from observations of the graph. 

Statistical physics provides an asymptotically exact analysis for this inference problem in the SBM. This involves calculating expectations over all possible node assignments consistent with given community sizes and edge probabilities, which can be interpreted as computing local magnetizations in a Potts glass model. The analysis leads to precise results on the statistical limits of community detection, offering insights into the information-theoretic feasibility of the task under different conditions.

The text emphasizes that understanding these statistical limits is crucial for assessing the performance and robustness of practical community detection algorithms, as well as for identifying scenarios where exact inference becomes theoretically impossible.


This text discusses the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), a probabilistic model used for community detection in networks, and its analysis using Belief Propagation (BP) and spectral clustering methods.

1. **Stochastic Block Model (SBM):** The SBM is defined by a graph G with N nodes divided into q groups, where the presence of an edge between two nodes depends on their group memberships. The model is parameterized by matrices A (adjacency), C (affinity), and M (membership), representing connection probabilities within and between groups, and group memberships respectively.

2. **Inference in SBM:** Inference in SBM involves finding the optimal community assignment that maximizes the likelihood of observing the graph. This is done using the Maximum Mutual Information (MMO) estimator or by learning model parameters using Expectation Maximization (EM). BP, a message-passing algorithm, can be used to compute marginal probabilities and expectations in the EM algorithm.

3. **Belief Propagation (BP) for SBM:** BP for SBM is described by iterative equations for messages ψi→j that represent the probability of node i being assigned to group si given no edge between nodes i and j. These messages are updated until they reach a fixed point, after which the free energy (log-likelihood) can be computed. The BP algorithm provides an asymptotically exact analysis for Bayes-optimal inference when model parameters match those that generated the graph.

4. **Phase Transitions in SBM:** SBM exhibits phase transitions, characterized by changes in inference performance. These are most pronounced when groups have equal average degrees. Key phases include paramagnetic (random guessing), detectability (good community recovery), and spinodal (community structure starts to disappear). The critical points for these transitions can be analyzed using BP's linear stability around the uniform fixed point.

5. **Spectral Clustering for SBM:** Spectral clustering methods, particularly those based on the non-backtracking matrix, offer an alternative to BP. These methods compute eigenvectors of a matrix (e.g., adjacency, Laplacian) and cluster nodes based on the signs of these vectors. For SBM with equal group degrees, spectral algorithms can achieve performance comparable to BP and even outperform standard spectral methods that fail near phase transitions.

6. **Non-Backtracking Matrix:** The non-backtracking matrix is a key operator in spectral clustering for sparse networks. Its spectrum provides information about community structure. On random graphs generated by SBM with equal group degrees, its leading eigenvalues are real and on the order of the square root of the average excess degree. This matrix's performance is robust against small local changes but can deteriorate under adversarial perturbations.

In summary, this text presents a detailed analysis of community detection in SBM using BP and spectral clustering methods, highlighting the effectiveness of spectral approaches based on non-backtracking matrices for sparse networks with equal group degrees. It also discusses phase transitions and their analysis via BP's linear stability.


The provided text discusses the Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm, a key method in the field of compressed sensing. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

**Compressed Sensing:** This is a technique used to infer a sparse N-dimensional vector x from a minimal number of linear projections y = Fx. The goal is to design an M × N measurement matrix F that allows for signal recovery with the smallest possible M, reducing costs, time, and radiation exposure in applications like medical imaging.

**Approximate Message Passing (AMP):** AMP is an algorithmic procedure developed by Donoho et al. [165] to tackle compressed sensing problems. Its origins can be traced back to statistical physics works on the perceptron problem and code-division multiple access (CDMA).

**Statistical Physics Derivation of AMP:** The derivation of AMP is based on a graphical model where each variable xi corresponds to a node, and interactions between variables are represented by edges with weights given by matrix Fμi. The measurements yμ are treated as planted disorder.

1. **Belief Propagation (BP):** BP is first written for this graphical model. It's a message-passing algorithm that computes approximations of the posterior marginals by sending messages mi→μ from variable nodes to factor nodes, and subsequent messages mμ→i back to variable nodes. The BP equations involve N-dimensional integrals, which are computationally intractable for large N.

2. **Relaxed Belief Propagation (r-BP):** To make the BP algorithm tractable, two facts are employed: the Central Limit Theorem and a projection of messages to only two of their moments (means and variances). This leads to r-BP, which involves pairs of means and variances for each pair variable-interaction.

3. **Derivation from BP to r-BP:** To derive r-BP from BP:
   - The variable zμ = Fμixi + 〈j≠i Fμjxj〉 is considered, where xjs are independent due to the central limit theorem. This allows us to approximate 〈j≠i F2 μjxj〉 as a Gaussian random variable with mean ωμ→i and variance Vμ→i.
   - The multi-dimensional integral in BP equations is replaced by a scalar Gaussian integral over z, using the first two moments of z (mean and variance).
   - The exponential term in the BP equation is expanded and re-exponentiated while keeping only leading order terms, introducing an output function gout.

The resulting r-BP algorithm provides a tractable approximation of the posterior marginals, enabling efficient signal recovery even for sparse signals in compressed sensing scenarios. This derivation showcases the power of statistical physics techniques in developing algorithms for complex inference problems.


The provided text discusses the Generalized Approximate Message Passing (G-AMP) algorithm, which is a method used for solving linear estimation problems. It's derived from the relaxed Belief Propagation (r-BP) algorithm and aims to compute marginal distributions in large systems with sparse priors and element-wise output channels.

1. **G-AMP Algorithm**: The G-AMP algorithm is an iterative process that updates variables ω, V, , and R. It begins by initializing these variables and then proceeds through several steps:

   - AMP Update of ω and V: These are computed using matrix multiplications involving F, a, and v from the previous iteration.
   
   - AMP Update of  and R: These involve partial derivatives of the output function gout with respect to ω, evaluated at the current estimates of ω and V.
   
   - AMP Update of the estimated marginals a and v: These are computed using input functions fa and fv, which depend on the current estimates of  and R.

2. **Derivation from r-BP**: The G-AMP algorithm simplifies the r-BP by leveraging weak dependencies of messages on the target node, similar to how standard Belief Propagation (BP) leads to TAP equations. This simplification results in Onsager reaction terms that maintain the leading order behavior of marginals.

3. **Bethe Free Energy**: The G-AMP algorithm minimizes a Bethe free energy function that involves Kullback-Leibler divergences between the marginal distributions and their respective priors or output channels.

4. **Convergence and Parameter Learning**: While G-AMP is theoretically guaranteed to converge in certain large, random settings, practical implementations may face issues due to mismatched signal distributions, non-random matrices, positive mean random matrices, or small system sizes. Research focuses on improving robustness through strategies like mean removal, randomized updates (like Swept-AMP), expectation-maximization learning of parameters, and adaptive damping.

5. **Examples**: The G-AMP algorithm is versatile and can handle various priors and output channels. Two common examples are:

   - Sparse prior with a Gauss-Bernoulli distribution (used in compressed sensing), where the input function fa involves Gaussian and exponential terms.
   
   - Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) as an output channel, which corresponds to a simple linear model where the output is the sum of the input and noise.

In summary, G-AMP is a powerful iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inverse problems under sparse priors, offering significant speed advantages over other methods due to its matrix multiplication structure. Its performance can be improved through various techniques targeting convergence robustness in diverse problem settings.


The text discusses the application of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms, which originated from statistical physics, to various signal processing tasks, particularly in compressed sensing and matrix factorization.

1. **Perceptron Problem**: The perceptron is a simple binary classification algorithm used for pattern recognition. It tries to learn the weights of input patterns to match predefined outputs. The number of patterns needed for reliable weight learning isn't explicitly defined, but efficient algorithms like Gradient Descent or Stochastic Gradient Descent are often employed.

2. **State Evolution and Phase Transitions**: State evolution is a statistical physics method used to analyze the performance of AMP in large systems with independent entries. It reveals phase transitions—changes in system behavior—that can occur depending on the signal distribution, measurement noise, or mismatch between prior and actual signal distributions. 

3. **Spatial Coupling**: This technique improves the performance of AMP algorithms by introducing correlations into the measurement matrix. By doing so, it can help overcome the limitations imposed by the first-order phase transitions seen in uncoupled systems. The spatially coupled matrices work by using a nucleation seed (a block with higher effective measurement rate) and interactions between neighboring blocks to ensure signal recovery across the entire system.

4. **Structured Priors**: AMP's performance can be enhanced by incorporating more complex, structured priors about the signal. Techniques such as Hybrid AMP combine AMP with additional graphical models that account for correlations between variables, leading to significant improvements in tasks like image denoising. Another method involves using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to model support patterns of signals, allowing the RBM's statistical description to be used within AMP.

5. **Non-Random Matrices and Discrete Tomography**: While random matrices are commonly used in AMP, exploring its performance with non-random matrices is crucial for broader applicability. Recent works have extended the S-AMP algorithm to general matrix ensembles under certain large system size limits, based on the S-transform of the measurement matrix spectrum. In the context of Discrete Tomography (CT), a message passing algorithm was designed that leverages the structural information about adjoining pixels in CT measurements, improving reconstruction with fewer measurements compared to classical methods.

6. **Optics in Complex Media**: AMP and related tools have been applied in physics, particularly in wavefront shaping for imaging through complex media like biological tissues or paint layers. These techniques help in estimating the transmission matrix of such media without a reference beam, enabling reference-less measurements and even focusing or imaging using scattering materials as lenses.

7. **Matrix Factorization**: Beyond linear estimation, AMP can also tackle the challenging problem of matrix factorization, where a noisy measurement of an M×N matrix Y needs to be decomposed into a product DX, with D being M×R and X being R×N. This problem involves various constraints like sparsity or low rank, making it algorithmically demanding but widely applicable across numerous fields, including recommendation systems, topic modeling, and blind source separation.

In summary, AMP is a versatile technique rooted in statistical physics that has shown great promise in solving complex signal processing tasks. Its applications range from improving perceptron-based classification to enhancing compressed sensing and matrix factorization techniques across various domains, including physics experiments.


The text discusses various applications of statistical physics principles to problems in signal processing, machine learning, and data analysis. It focuses on two main areas: dictionary learning and feature learning in neural networks, along with blind source separation and sparse Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

1. Dictionary Learning: This is a method to learn a basis for sparse representation of signals from samples. The challenge lies in designing efficient algorithms that can achieve this from the smallest number of samples possible. In mathematical terms, given matrix Y representing N data samples, with M dimensions each, the goal is to decompose Y into DX + W, where D is the dictionary (matrix of R atoms), X is a sparse representation of the data (with only ρ fraction of non-zero elements per column), and W represents possible noise due to approximative nature.

2. Feature Learning in Neural Networks: Deep learning neural networks have seen remarkable success in tasks like image recognition, speech processing, and question answering. This success is largely attributed to their ability to learn features effectively. The basic building block of deep neural networks can be viewed as a matrix factorization problem with activation functions corresponding to output probabilities.

3. Blind Source Separation: An example includes separating the speeches of R participants at a party using M sensors, where recording at one sensor is an unknown linear combination of all participants' speech. When the number of sensors (M) is less than the number of people (R), recovery of individual speeches is theoretically possible only if they are sparse in some known basis.

4. Sparse PCA: In traditional PCA, the goal is to represent data with a low-rank matrix, reducing necessary information for description. However, in some applications, it's desirable that this linear combination is sparse further. The challenge lies in integrating this sparsity constraint into singular value decomposition (SVD), necessitating alternative algorithmic approaches.

The text also mentions the application of statistical physics methods to these problems through a teacher-student scenario and the use of algorithms like Approximate Message Passing (AMP) and replica method. It highlights that while theoretical predictions suggest superior performance compared to current algorithms, there's significant room for improving algorithmic efficiency in these areas.

The main themes discussed are:
- The use of statistical physics principles to understand inference problems.
- Identification of phase transitions in these problems and their correlation with computational and statistical thresholds.
- Application of methods like AMP and replica approach to derive performance limits, phase diagrams, and mean-squared errors for various scenarios including dictionary learning, blind source separation, sparse PCA, robust PCA, and matrix completion.
- The potential for developing more efficient algorithms by leveraging insights from these theoretical analyses.

### 03-Understanding the phenomenology of borderline personality disorder from the patient_s perspect

Title: Understanding the Phenomenology of Borderline Personality Disorder from the Patient's Perspective

Authors: Georgia Black, Joanna Murray, and Graham Thornicroft

Journal: Journal of Mental Health

Year: 2014

This research article explores the subjective experiences, or phenomenology, of individuals diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) from their own perspectives. The study was part of a larger doctoral project and consisted of interviews with nine participants from specialist services in South London, UK, who had been diagnosed with BPD.

The primary aim was to gain insights into the experiences of individuals with BPD, which could potentially inform service development and clinical training. The researchers employed a phenomenological qualitative method for data analysis using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).

Two superordinate themes were identified from the interview data: Internal Dynamics and External Dynamics.

1. Internal Dynamics: This theme encompasses experiences that are contained within an individual's bodily sensations, including dramatic perceptual and psychological changes such as feeling non-existent or longing for death. These participants reported using self-harm as a coping mechanism to manage these intense feelings. The sight of blood was found to be particularly significant for some participants, serving as a reassuring sign of their existence. Participants also described complex and contradictory experiences related to suicidality, with some feeling both an immediate urge to die and a passive acceptance or rationalization of death.

2. External Dynamics: This theme involves experiences arising from interactions with others, particularly families. The participants recognized the impact their illness had on family members, often modifying their behavior to protect them and minimize difficult conversations about their condition. Some participants hid their suffering from loved ones or moderated their feelings to maintain a sense of normalcy for those around them. Families were also seen as important motivating factors for change in personality disorder, with some participants attributing their continued survival solely to the protective roles played by family members.

The study's findings contribute to understanding the complex phenomenology of BPD, revealing social roles that interact with altered perceptual states and suicidality, as well as passive aspects of the relationship with death. These insights could potentially aid in improving therapeutic contact, reducing stigma, and informing clinical interventions for individuals with BPD.

The authors highlight the need to consider feelings and experiences, such as those related to dissociation, altered perceptions, and suicidal ideation, which may be overlooked in current treatment guidelines focusing primarily on acute interpersonal symptoms like unstable relationships and impulsive behaviors.


Title: Phenomenological Study of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) Experiences

This text presents a study on the experiences of individuals diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), focusing on how these perceptual states influence their social relationships and potential implications for psychotherapeutic interventions. 

1. **Study Methodology**: This is a qualitative, phenomenological study that involves open-ended discussions in interviews with BPD patients. The sample includes one male participant, which the authors acknowledge may limit the generalizability of findings, particularly regarding themes related to family dynamics. It's noted that these experiences aren't exhaustive and do not aim to comprehensively describe BPD phenomenology.

2. **Key Findings**:

   - Participants often perceived support as crucial but it frequently led to the concealment of feelings, resulting in disagreements and isolation.
   
   - The study suggests that understanding these specific perceptual-social interactions could be valuable for designing effective group (Hummelen et al., 2007) and individual interventions (Scanlon & Adlam, 2009; Wright et al., 2007).

3. **Limitations**: The study's main limitation is its small sample size, lack of gender diversity (only one male participant), and the non-systematic exploration of BPD experiences (not aimed at exhaustively describing BPD phenomenology). 

4. **Conclusion & Implications**: The authors emphasize the importance of incorporating phenomenological categories based on service users' experiences into new interventions, suggesting adjustments to defining clinical features in guidelines to reflect these insights. They position their findings as a bridge between practitioners, policy makers, and BPD patients needing specific forms of understanding.

5. **References**: The authors cite various studies that inform the discussion on BPD, including works by Birch et al., Brooke & Horn, Commons & Lewis, Giffin, Gunderson, Hughes & Huby, Hummelen et al., McAllister, NHS guidelines, Perseius et al., Scanlon & Adlam, Sharaf et al., Smith (2011), Smith et al. (2009), Svenaeus, Taulke-Johnson, Wright et al., and Zanarini.

6. **Declaration of Interest**: The research was conducted at the Health Services and Population Research department, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, with no conflicts of interest declared by the authors. They are solely responsible for the content and writing of this article.

In summary, this study provides valuable insights into the lived experiences of individuals with BPD, highlighting how perceptions of support can paradoxically lead to feelings of isolation. It underscores the need for interventions sensitive to these nuanced social dynamics, potentially guiding therapeutic approaches and policy decisions in mental health care. However, due to its small sample size and non-systematic approach, further research is encouraged to validate and expand upon these findings.


### 04-A meditation on boredom_ re-appraising its value through introspective phenomenology

The article "A meditation on boredom: re-appraising its value through introspective phenomenology" by Tim Lomas, published in Qualitative Research in Psychology, explores the potential positive aspects of boredom. The study uses an unconventional method called introspective phenomenology to investigate the nature and value of boredom.

Lomas describes how boredom has historically been perceived as a negative state, characterized by feelings of frustration, indifference, and malaise. This perspective is reflected in various psychological theories that differentiate between existential (or melancholic) boredom, situational boredom, and boredom of surfeit. All these forms are generally considered detrimental to well-being, linked with anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and dysfunctional behaviors.

However, the author questions whether boredom's negative connotation is justified or if people simply struggle to tolerate it. Drawing on Zen Buddhism and its practice of meditation, Lomas proposes that boredom could have valuable aspects such as altered perceptions of time, fostering creativity, and enabling self-exploration.

To investigate these possibilities empirically, the author conducted a case study using introspective phenomenology during an hour-long airplane flight. By recording his thoughts, feelings, and experiences in real-time using an adapted version of Csikszentmihalyi and Larson's (1987) Experiencing Sampling Method, he aimed to capture the nuances of boredom. The collected data were then analyzed using an adaptation of Smith's (1996) Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).

The results revealed three main sources of value in the state of boredom: altered perception of time, awakened curiosity about the environment, and exploration of self. Lomas found that boredom can slow down one's subjective experience of time, which he suggests could lead to profound insights about existence and reality. He also observed increased curiosity about the immediate surroundings and a deeper introspection into one's thoughts and feelings.

While acknowledging the limitations of generalizing from this single case study, Lomas argues that boredom might not be an entirely negative state when engaged with intentionally. Instead, he proposes re-evaluating boredom as potentially having positive aspects and offering opportunities for self-discovery and well-being enhancement if individuals learn to tolerate and embrace it.

In conclusion, this article challenges the common understanding of boredom by examining its potential value through introspective phenomenology. It encourages readers to reconsider their perceptions of boredom as an opportunity for personal growth and enrichment rather than solely a hindrance or discomfort.


The text describes a qualitative research study on the experience of boredom during a one-hour introspective exercise. The researcher, Dr. T. Lomas, was instructed to remain bored for this hour, recording his thoughts and sensations without distraction or escape. 

The study yielded several key findings, categorized into three meta-themes: altered time perception, environmental curiosity, and exploration of self.

1. Altered Time Perception: The researcher experienced a paradoxical sensation of both quickening and slowing down of time. At times, he felt as if time stood still (e.g., minute 46), while at other moments, it seemed to slip away rapidly (e.g., minutes 3, 35, and 52). This strange perception of time was accompanied by a poignant awareness of its preciousness and the rapid passage of life.

2. Environmental Curiosity: Initially, the researcher felt disengaged and bored with his surroundings (the aircraft cabin). However, as he was unable to distract himself or change his environment, he began to notice new features and appreciate details that he had previously overlooked. This de-familiarization led to novel aesthetic experiences, such as admiring the intricate patterns on cabin crew uniforms (minute 40).

3. Exploration of Self: The introspective exercise also prompted self-reflection and exploration. The researcher observed sensations and thoughts that typically go unnoticed. For example, he noticed a recurring sensation of a "knot" behind his forehead (minutes 9, 18, 44, and 49), which seemed connected to his sense of self. He also experienced thoughts emerging unbidden (minute 26), a phenomenon consistent with Buddhist philosophy. Furthermore, the exercise broadened his subjective experience, including heightened awareness of his bodily sensations (minutes 29, 30, and 32).

The study underscores the transformative potential of embracing boredom rather than trying to escape it. When fully engaged with an unstimulating situation, the researcher found value in unexpected ways, experienced altered time perceptions, gained novel insights into his environment, and explored aspects of his self previously unknown or ignored. This research contributes to understanding boredom as a complex experiential state that can lead to valuable existential insights and personal growth when embraced.


The text is a reflection on the experience of boredom by Tim Lomas, a lecturer in Applied Positive Psychology at the University of East London. Lomas conducted a one-hour experiment where he made an observation every 60 seconds to explore the nature of boredom and its potential value. 

The experiment was influenced by various factors that may limit its generalizability:

1. The design of the study, with observations taken every minute, inevitably impacted the experience itself. Lomas found these 60-second intervals brief and intrusive, often focusing more on recording the observation than experiencing boredom itself. He also acknowledged that knowing he would later publish his findings added pressure to make them interesting or noteworthy.

2. The data collected is specific to one individual's experience on a single occasion, making it inherently particular and shaped by Lomas' personal history and characteristics. While he attempted to acknowledge these influences, he also warns against overemphasizing reflexivity (self-analysis) lest it become "epistemological narcissism" - focusing more on the researcher than their data.

3. The study does not aim to prove that boredom is universally positive or beneficial, but rather suggests it might have potential value under certain circumstances. Lomas recognizes that some individuals, like isolated older adults, may genuinely struggle with severe boredom and require assistance to find engaging activities.

Lomas proposes a reappraisal of boredom, drawing parallels between it and meditation. He suggests that if people view boredom as a form of mindfulness or mental training, they might no longer perceive it negatively. This perspective aligns with recent developments in Positive Psychology (PP), which have started to challenge the distinction between 'positive' and 'negative' states, recognizing that what seems positive can sometimes be detrimental, and vice versa.

To advance this line of research, Lomas recommends several approaches for future studies:

1. Recruit a diverse group of participants regarding age, gender, ethnicity, and education level to enhance generalizability.

2. Extend the duration of boredom induction beyond one hour to allow boredom to fully manifest. Experimenting with different durations could provide valuable insights.

3. Increase the interval between observation prompts from 60 seconds, suggesting gaps of five or even ten minutes might be preferable. These intervals should ideally be spaced randomly to prevent participants anticipating or preparing for them.

4. Implement verbal reporting methods (e.g., audio recordings) instead of written notes to reduce task demands and make the process less intrusive.

5. Develop protocols that mask the purpose of the study from participants, preventing them from realizing it's about boredom. This could involve recruiting individuals for an ostensibly unrelated experiment (e.g., a flight simulation), followed by periods of solitude and intermittent inquiries about their thoughts.

In conclusion, this reflective piece challenges conventional views on boredom, presenting it as potentially valuable when engaged with constructively. It underscores the need for rigorous research to validate these ideas while acknowledging the limitations of single-case studies.


### 04-Cognitive access and cognitive phenomenology_ conceptual and empirical issues

Title: Cognitive Access and Cognitive Phenomenology: Conceptual and Empirical Issues
Author: Miguel Ángel Sebastián
Journal: Philosophical Explorations, Volume 19, Issue 2 (2016)

In this paper, Miguel Ángel Sebastián explores the implications of a non-access theory of phenomenal consciousness on the cognitive phenomenology thesis—the idea that thoughts have their own unique form of cognitive phenomenology. The author begins by outlining the distinction between access and phenomenal consciousness, which has moved from a conceptual debate to an empirical one focusing on whether there can be phenomenal consciousness without cognitive access.

1. Phenomenology and Cognitive Access:
The paper starts by presenting the distinction between phenomenology (something it's like to be in a mental state) and cognitive access (the availability of mental content for belief formation, rational control of action, and report). The Global Workspace Theory is introduced as the most widely accepted theory of cognitive access.

2. The Challenge:
Sebastián argues that if phenomenal consciousness can be disentangled from cognitive access (as non-access theories propose), then it is reasonable to expect this separation in thoughts too. This presents a challenge for the cognitive phenomenology thesis, as it forces us to consider whether there are thoughts with cognitive phenomenology we lack access to or if cognitive phenomenology does not exist at all.

3. Assessing the Reply:
   - Conceptual Problems:
     Sebastián explores current taxonomies of thoughts, which mainly distinguish between a-conscious (reportable) and non-a-conscious thoughts. He suggests that these taxonomies might be expanded to accommodate phenomenally conscious thoughts without cognitive access. The author discusses the distinctions between occurrent (active in reasoning) and dispositional (enduring but less active) thoughts, as well as explicit (representationally available for attitudes) and implicit (not representationally available) beliefs. He argues that, according to dual-process theories of cognition, there could be non-a-conscious explicit occurrent thoughts, which are suitable candidates for having phenomenal consciousness.

   - Empirical Problems:
     The author then addresses empirical challenges in assessing whether there are thoughts we lack cognitive access to but still have phenomenal consciousness. He proposes two lines of evidence:

     a) Implicit Bias Research: Sebastián references Mandelbaum's argument that implicit biases, if caused by non-a-conscious occurrent explicit beliefs, would be influenced by rational argumentation rather than extinction or counterconditioning. Empirical findings suggest that rational argumentation does indeed affect implicit biases, supporting the existence of non-a-conscious explicit thoughts.

     b) Neuroscientific Evidence: Using research on dlPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), which is crucial for cognitive access and deactivated during sleep, Sebastián suggests that thought-like mental activity occurs in NREM sleep despite lacking reportability. This implies that thoughts without cognitive access might involve fully propositional representation, accessible via memory retrieval rather than working memory.

In conclusion, the paper argues that the distinction between cognitive access and phenomenal consciousness does not undermine the cognitive phenomenology thesis. Instead, it encourages further empirical investigation into the nature of thoughts and their phenomenal properties.


The text discusses a philosophical debate surrounding cognitive access and phenomenology, specifically focusing on the nature of thoughts during dreaming. 

1. **Cognitive Access vs. Phenomenology**: The author argues that having cognitive access to a mental state (the ability to report it) is not sufficient for it to be phenomenally conscious. This challenges the Cognitive Phenomenology thesis, which posits that thoughts become phenomenally conscious if they're poised for report, belief formation, and rational control of action.

2. **Dual-process Theories**: These theories distinguish between System 1 (fast, automatic, and unconscious) and System 2 (slow, deliberative, and conscious) processes. The author suggests that thoughts could be System 1 processes, thus lacking cognitive access but still phenomenally conscious.

3. **Empirical Evidence**: Research indicates that dreams might involve explicit thoughts we lack cognitive access to upon awakening. Horikawa et al.'s (2013) study decoded visual imagery during sleep using fMRI, suggesting that dreams could indeed include such thoughts.

4. **Implicit vs. Explicit Thoughts**: The author argues that even if thoughts are implicit (unconscious), they can still be phenomenally conscious based on their capacity to form episodic memories. This is different from fully unconscious states, which cannot be retrieved into working memory for report.

5. **Phenomenology and Episodic Memory**: The author speculates that phenomenology might play a crucial role in connecting thoughts during sleep with episodic memories we form upon awakening. This could mean that System 2 thoughts, though unconscious at the time of dreaming, are encoded differently than System 1 thoughts and can be retrieved later due to their phenomenal nature.

6. **Counterarguments**: Critics might argue for different mechanisms causing phenomenology in sensory states versus thoughts or suggest that emotions in dreams could suffice for memory formation without phenomenology. However, the author contends these arguments lack independent support and may conflict with neural activation patterns observed during NREM sleep.

The paper concludes by suggesting that accepting a non-access theory of consciousness might indirectly support the Cognitive Phenomenology thesis. It proposes that System 1 thoughts are fully unconscious, and thus, cannot be encoded into episodic memory for later report. Conversely, System 2 thoughts have phenomenology and can be remembered despite lacking cognitive access at the time of dreaming due to their phenomenal nature. This remains a speculative idea requiring further empirical investigation.


### 04-Humanity in Schillebeeckx_s Hermeneutic Phenomenology. Towards a Methodology

The article by Ramona Simuț titled "Humanity in Schillebeeckx's Hermeneutic Phenomenology. Towards a Methodology" published in the Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology (2018) explores the hermeneutic phenomenology of Edward Schillebeeckx, particularly focusing on his concept of humanity and its relevance to Christian doctrines.

Schillebeeckx's hermeneutical method is inspired by Western phenomenology and anthropology, which he encountered before and during World War II under the influence of Dominic Maria De Petter. This exposure led him to appreciate human experience as crucial in interpreting divine revelation and Christian doctrines like salvation, sin, and redemption.

Key themes in Schillebeeckx's thought include:

1. **Creation and Divine Disclosure**: Schillebeeckx posits that the history of salvation can be found within human history. He interprets creation as a realm encapsulating both salvation and perdition, with secular history (anthropocentric and expressible in human terms) guiding our understanding of God's love and action for humanity.

2. **Revelation**: Schillebeeckx views revelation as an interpretative series of historical events, with two levels of meaning: the first level is entirely anthropological (human), while the second level relates to divinity or the sacred. He contends that facts only become history within a framework of meaning or tradition, and this human element of liberation can be interpreted on a second level in relation to God.

3. **Religion**: Schillebeeckx acknowledges that non-believers can interpret events as revelatory based on shared historical consciousness and the radical otherness of God. Religion, for him, is the place where humans become explicitly aware of God's saving actions in history, emphasizing a universal character of salvation across religions.

4. **Historical/Liberational Dimensions**: Schillebeeckx understands revelation as tied to human language and religious traditions. He illustrates this with examples like the Exodus event from the Old Testament, which was initially a liberating historical event before being recognized as a saving event within Hebrew tradition.

5. **Church and World**: In Schillebeeckx's thought, the church's role is to mediate divine revelation into human history. He advocates for an "expanded theology of ministry," where the church moves from a cosmological to an anthropological dimension in its understanding and proclamation of faith, reflecting contemporary reality.

Throughout his work, Schillebeeckx aims to reorient readers toward the essence of Christian faith by emphasizing the historical grounding of Christology and demythologizing ideological interpretations. Simuț highlights that while Schillebeeckx's account of Jesus as the Son is meticulously biblically grounded, it sometimes corrects or expands upon existing accounts from the Old and New Testaments. The article concludes by noting that Schillebeeckx's "Abba" theory—focusing on Jesus' developing awareness of his relationship with God as the Father—remains a subject of debate among his supporters and critics alike.


Edward Schillebeeckx's perspective on the Christian Church is multifaceted, encompassing both a doctrinal/theological dimension and an ethical/relational one. 

In terms of the theological dimension, Schillebeeckx questions the traditional view of the Church as a central mediator in God's plan for transforming secular history into salvation history. Instead, he advocates for a "negative ecclesiology" or church theology in the minor key to reestablish balance between theology and humanity after centuries of doctrinal distancing from people. This perspective calls for rethinking Christian doctrine, including concepts of God, Jesus, and creation, without explicitly stating the Church's role as a mediator, assuming direct contact with the highest reality.

Schillebeeckx emphasizes that faith should be articulated in human language to regain its empirical dimension and become a religion of the people, as it once was. Consequently, he suggests that redefining the Church necessitates a redefinition of core Christian doctrines discussed in his work "Jesus: Opening the Word of God" (JOWC).

From an ethical/relational perspective, Schillebeeckx defines the Church through its relationship with Jesus of Nazareth. The Church's role in salvation history is clarified as it retains significance for believers and Christ’s presence within the community. This perspective incorporates a social phenomenology of ecclesial presence, where the resurrected Christ appears and is present in the gathered community of faith. The Church mediates Jesus' death as salvation from suffering, aiming to bring about God's Kingdom or full realization of humanity according to God's eternal plan.

Schillebeeckx also explores the concept of pluralism in Christian churches, understanding it as unity among Christendom's various denominations, aligning with the post-Vatican II orientation of the Roman Catholic Church. 

This exploration of the Church follows a circular pattern in JOWC, moving from discussions on the relationship between God and creation (first chapter) to examinations of the Church's relationship with Jesus (second chapter), and finally addressing the Church's relationship with the world (third chapter). This progression enables Schillebeeckx to emphasize Christian dogma and faith in light of a redefined reality for contemporary individuals while approaching the final part of his book, which focuses on Jesus as ethics for modern society and politics.

Schillebeeckx's soteriology in JOWC is historical rather than dogmatic, reminding readers that salvation initially had a worldly, non-religious character. Creation itself was seen as the unveiling of God’s love and salvation in ancient times, perceived by people without religious influence. In the New Testament context, Schillebeeckx posits the Church as a "sacrament" or sign of God's salvation, while differentiating between the Church itself (as divine revelation) and its presence in the world (the outward Church).

The author also addresses the distinction between religion and the Church, suggesting that religions and churches are expressions of humanity's salvation need but not salvation itself. Schillebeeckx identifies religions as "segments of profane history," while the Christian Church is a specific instance of faith among many others. He argues for the importance of genuine mysticism and politics in churches, emphasizing that their social implications should not pervert their sacramental or ritualistic functions.

In conclusion, Schillebeeckx's thought on God's revelation within human history reveals a nuanced understanding of divine disclosure through creation and the Church. His perspective encompasses multiple dimensions, including the universality of revelation, different levels of meaning for believers and non-believers, and the Church as both a doctrinal entity and an ethical, relational presence in the world.


### 04-Joint attention in joint action

The article "Joint attention in joint action" by Anika Fiebich and Shaun Gallagher discusses the role of intention and joint attention in joint actions. The authors propose a framework to understand different types of joint actions, distinguishing between joint path-goal actions and joint final-goal actions based on shared intentions.

1. Joint Actions: These are social interactions where two or more individuals coordinate their actions in space and time to bring about a change in the environment. Shared intentions play a crucial role in joint actions, as they involve not just having the same goal but mutual knowledge of aiming for that common goal—a 'shared intention.'

2. Shared Intentions: A shared intention is more than a common goal; it requires we-intentions (special intending attitudes to cooperate towards achieving a common goal). These we-intentions are distinct from Searle's notion of 'we-intentions,' which he views as single individuals' special mental contents involving we-activities.

3. Joint Attention: The authors distinguish between shared attention and joint attention, the latter involving mutual knowledge that both subjects are attentive towards the same external entity. They propose a more refined definition of joint attention as intentional joint attention (iJA), where individuals not only share their attention but also intend to be mutually attentive toward the same entity or event.

4. Intentional Joint Attention (iJA) as Basic Joint Action: The authors argue that iJA is a basic joint action on analogy with Chisholm's instrumental definition of basic actions. A basic joint action, according to this account, is performed without performing some other joint action. Here, iJA fulfills the conditions of a joint action by involving shared intention (maintaining joint attention), common knowledge about that goal, and cooperative behavior patterns to achieve it.

The authors contend that iJA is not just a precursor or component of complex joint actions but can also function as a basic part of either joint path-goal or joint final-goal actions. They claim that iJA helps maintain the course of more complex joint actions and prevents failure in achieving shared intentions, thereby serving an essential role in cooperation among participating agents.

This framework aims to provide a systematic account of the role of intention and joint attention in joint actions, contributing to the ongoing debate on the nature and character of these social interactions.


The provided text discusses the concept of joint action, a collaborative effort between individuals to achieve a shared goal. The authors propose a framework distinguishing two types of joint actions based on their nature: (1) joint path-goal actions, where coordinated behavior is an end in itself, and (2) joint final-goal actions, where the focus is on achieving a specific outcome or product.

Joint path-goal actions are motivated by shared enjoyment or mutual benefit, whereas joint final-goal actions aim to accomplish a particular end-state or result. The distinction between these two types of joint actions should not be viewed as a strict dichotomy but rather as endpoints on a continuum. In reality, many joint actions exhibit mixed motivations and can encompass elements of both path-goal and final-goal actions.

Intentional Joint Attention (iJA) plays an essential role in coordinating behavior within joint actions, particularly in mitigating the risk of shared intention failure. However, its involvement is not always necessary; language or sets of instructions may substitute for iJA to ensure successful cooperation.

The authors argue against a compositional account of basic joint action, instead favoring an instrumental perspective that allows for the possibility that iJA does not need to be present in complex joint actions such as playing chess. Moreover, iJA can stand on its own as proto-declarative joint attention, serving purposes beyond itself.

In some cases, no joint attention is involved at all, like terrorist actions. The level of cooperation and iJA required depend on the situational factors within a given joint action. For instance, in chess, while players might intentionally engage in joint attention during play, it is not necessary for fulfilling their shared intention to win the game.

In summary, this paper offers a nuanced framework for understanding joint actions by considering various motivations and situational factors that influence cooperation between individuals. It underscores the crucial role of iJA in managing risks associated with shared intentions but also highlights its potential redundancy or absence in specific contexts. The authors emphasize the importance of contextual analysis to determine whether iJA, language, or instructions drive joint actions successfully.


### 04-Phenomenology of the Transcendence of Space-time Coordinates

The article "Phenomenology of the Transcendence of Space-time Coordinates" by Gustavo Daniel Beláustegui explores the concept of the Self's anticipatory capacity regarding death through two cases of "death announcements." These are instances where individuals, seemingly unaware of any impending medical condition or accident, depict their own death in symbolic ways.

**Case 1: Drawing "Sent with Certain Uneasiness of Conscience"**
This case involves a high school girl who produced a drawing featuring symbols often associated with the anticipation of death (such as a destroyed castle and a woman on a cornice). She passed away six months later in a military plane crash.

**Case 2: Text Found in Personal Computer**
This case is about a seventeen-year-old boy who wrote a farewell letter on his computer, expressing his impending departure and bidding goodbye to his family members. He died suddenly from a brain aneurysm a few months later.

Beláustegui suggests that these instances reflect the Self's ability to transcend space-time coordinates, potentially anticipating its continuous transformations over time. This idea is linked to Jungian psychology and the concept of the soul, as well as contemporary scientific notions like morphic fields proposed by Rupert Sheldrake.

The author posits that such "death announcements" challenge a purely materialistic understanding of human consciousness. These instances reveal an acausal knowledge present in the Self—a knowledge beyond ordinary empirical science or rational prediction. 

Beláustegui argues for an epistemological intersection between objective and subjective approaches to understand the relationship between the Self and biological death, acknowledging that we can't fully comprehend what lies beyond the loss of spatial and temporal reality. Yet, he suggests that life itself transcends such limitations, and there's a task for us—to prepare ourselves to welcome this transformation, as Elisabeth Kübler-Ross emphasizes in her work on death and dying.

The article concludes by highlighting the need for a phenomenology that includes lived experiences like "death announcements," which point towards something beyond the content of our experiences confined within time and space—possibly, a function of the Self or morphic fields in contemporary scientific terms.


### 05-Medical Phenomenology and Stroke Rehabilitation_ An Introduction

Title: Medical Phenomenology and Stroke Rehabilitation: An Introduction

Author: Gary Goldberg, BASc, MD (Medical Director, Polytrauma Transitional Rehabilitation Program, Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center; Professor, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University Health System)

Journal: Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation (Volume 18, Issue 1, January-February 2011)

Summary:

The article introduces the theme of medical phenomenology and its relevance to stroke rehabilitation within the context of open peer commentary. It begins by explaining phenomenology as a branch of philosophy that focuses on describing and ordering human experience, placing first-person reports as primary data rather than secondary or "metaphysical." The article then discusses how this philosophical approach can be applied to medicine in general and stroke rehabilitation specifically.

Phenomenology helps clinicians understand the significance of narrative, the process of adaptation at the integrated whole-person level, and the role of context in shaping recovery. By recognizing these aspects, a more holistic and humanistic framework for stroke rehabilitation is created, moving beyond the strictly scientific perspective.

The article also delves into embodiment as an organizing principle linking conscious experience within the lived body to transformations in function due to acquired pathologies like stroke. It suggests that phenomenology acknowledges the subjective aspects of human existence crucial for understanding illness, which might otherwise be overlooked or undervalued by a purely scientific approach.

Furthermore, Goldberg emphasizes the importance of context in stroke rehabilitation – including culture, personality traits, premorbid experiences, and caregivers' involvement – as critical factors influencing function and recovery.

The article outlines an open peer commentary format used for this issue of Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation. A target paper was selected based on its lucid presentation of issues related to the relationship between rehabilitation professionals and their stroke patients, followed by commentaries from invited experts addressing specific aspects of the target paper's content.

The article concludes by highlighting phenomenology's potential in bridging gaps between objective assessments of well-being and subjective experiences of illness, ultimately fostering a more attuned dialogue between physicians and patients.

Key Points:
1. Phenomenology is the study of human experience as it unfolds in consciousness, emphasizing first-person reports over objectivity alone.
2. Medical phenomenology can offer a holistic, humanistic framework for understanding and addressing stroke rehabilitation by acknowledging subjective aspects like narrative, adaptation, and context.
3. Embodiment is crucial in comprehending the lived experience of stroke patients, linking conscious experiences with altered bodily functions.
4. Open peer commentary format: A target paper was selected, followed by commentaries from invited experts addressing specific aspects of the issues raised in the target paper. This format encourages thought-provoking dialogue and exploration among clinicians involved in stroke rehabilitation.


### 05-Nikos Kazantzakis_s phenomenology and its relevance to the study of organizations

The article by Stephanos Avakian explores the relevance of Nikos Kazantzakis's phenomenology to the study of organizations. The author begins by discussing George Morgan's (1980, 1983, 1986, 1996) use of metaphors to conceptualize organizations as entities capable of influencing human consciousness and behavior. These metaphors include instruments of domination, brains, systems, machines, etc., which carry the capacity to be an alternative analytical exposition situating parts and wholes within a common frame of analysis.

The article then highlights limitations in Morgan's conceptualization of these metaphors, particularly their entitative attributes that undermine human-related processes interacting with organizational aspects. These attributes include organizations as instruments of domination (due to control over behavior) and psychic prisons (influencing perceived boundaries for compliance). The paper argues that Morgan's work does not fully account for the nuances of human experiences, particularly the struggle between content and process properties within different categories of human existence.

To address these limitations, Avakian turns to Nikos Kazantzakis's phenomenological perspective. He introduces a typology based on three transient relationships as states of existence: relatedness, affirmation, and temporality. This typology aims to capture the ongoing struggle between content and process rooted in the broader existential struggle between permanence and temporality.

1. **Relatedness**: Kazantzakis's notion of relatedness refers to the experience of the present where individuals develop internalized relationships between objects and subjects, eventually defining their existence. However, for Kazantzakis, relating within a never-ending process raises questions about the meaning of existence and the struggle with ambiguity. It is a process directed by individual decision-making power. Narratives, in his work, serve as a vehicle to expound on human experience, capturing timely development events and associated meanings.

2. **Affirmation**: Kazantzakis's concept of affirmation pertains to the development of human capacity to sustain oneself against forces negating it. It is not an individual choice at a single point in time but a process that unfolds over time. Affirmation becomes a moral act where individuals seek to assert existence amidst opposing forces, embracing self-qualities hidden within. This development is decisive for both the life and fate of the individual and humanity at large.

3. **Temporality**: The concept of temporality in Kazantzakis's thought reflects on the fragility of schemata interpretation, especially in how individuals internalize them. It underscores the organization as an entity that can provide stability for individuals while simultaneously posing threats. This view has implications for understanding the power dynamics between organizations and their members, suggesting that schemata's internalization can be sensitive and subject to ongoing development.

The article concludes by arguing that Kazantzakis's process philosophy offers a more nuanced understanding of organizational life. It highlights human-led transitions challenging the entitative form organizations are traditionally portrayed as, thus enriching our comprehension of organizational processes and their impact on members' experiences. By incorporating Kazantzakis's phenomenological perspective, researchers can better capture the complexities and dynamism inherent in human-organization relationships.


The provided text discusses the philosophical work of Nikos Kazantzakis, particularly focusing on his exploration of identity, temporality, and the struggle between content and process. The author argues that Kazantzakis's thought offers valuable insights for organizational theory. Here is a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Identity and Aspiration**: Kazantzakis portrays an individual (later identified as Jesus) who is a skilled carpenter making crosses for the Roman enemy. Despite his role, he aspires to be more than what society expects of him – a potential savior. This depiction highlights how one's identity can be influenced by both their social environment and personal aspirations.

2. **Affirmation**: Kazantzakis' philosophy is rooted in Bergson's process philosophy, which emphasizes the role of affirmation as a way to tackle existential concerns during transitions. Affirmation involves reconciling being and non-being, recognizing one's condition as both limited by society and capable of transcending those limits.

3. **Temporal Existence**: Kazantzakis views human existence as an ongoing struggle between existence and materiality, with temporality playing a central role. The temporality of human life is seen as a liminal process carrying ontological endings, which forces individuals to grapple with the tension between creation in the material world and living within the temporal span of existence.

4. **Theoretical Implications for Organizational Theory**: The author suggests that Kazantzakis's philosophy can contribute to organizational theory by advancing a conceptualization of transitionality, which emphasizes content-process tensions rooted in existential struggles.

   - **Content-Process Tension**: This concept challenges the dominance of entitative attributes associated with organizations and highlights that individuals exert considerable force in managing their existence through a realization of different life stages.
   
   - **Self as Primary Entity**: Kazantzakis's emphasis on the self as an entity capable of regulating transitions between permanence and temporality offers a unique perspective for understanding organizational dynamics. The individual's capacity to identify with an existential repertoire of motifs transcends existence represented solely as a temporal activity with a beginning and end.
   
   - **Temporal Power**: Kazantzakis demonstrates that the human will can create entities carrying greater permanence and stability than immaterial considerations, suggesting that organizations' development should account for different qualities of temporality not currently captured in metaphoric organizational representations.

In summary, this text interprets Nikos Kazantzakis's philosophical work to contribute new perspectives on identity formation, the role of affirmation in managing existential concerns, and the importance of temporality in understanding human existence. The author argues that these insights can enrich organizational theory by challenging current assumptions about organizations as entitative entities and offering a phenomenological approach to understanding individuals' relationships with them.


### 05-The Anticipation of the Present_ Phenomenology of d_j_ vu

The paper "The Anticipation of the Present: Phenomenology of déjà vu" by Stefano Micali explores the phenomenon of déjà vu from a phenomenological perspective. The author divides his analysis into two sections, beginning with an examination of Henri Bergson's work on déjà vu and concluding with a detailed description of a specific form of déjà vu experience.

**Bergson's Analysis of Déjà Vu:**

Bergson's "Memory of the Present and False Recognition" essay presents an original interpretation of déjà vu, challenging common assumptions about its nature. Micali highlights three key features in Bergson's analysis:

1. Memory of the present: Bergson argues that déjà vu involves a simultaneous awareness of perception and memory, with the present moment duplicated into actuality (perception) and virtuality (memory). This experience is usually overlooked as unimportant.
2. Splitting of the ego: The feeling of déjà vu arises from a duplication of self-experience - one acting freely in the present, while another feels determined by a past, replayed experience.
3. Premonition: The sense of familiarity experienced during déjà vu extends into the future, creating an impression that one is able to anticipate upcoming events.

**Critiques and Limitations of Bergson's Analysis:**

Micali points out several ambiguities and limitations in Bergson's interpretation:

1. Ambiguity regarding the unity or duality of consciousness during déjà vu, as Bergson oscillates between viewing it as a simultaneous awareness of two streams (memory and perception) and as a single flow with a unique form.
2. Structural problems in describing the relationship between memory and perception flows, as Bergson suggests they are simultaneously continuous while their modes of appearance differ.
3. Disregard for content-related premonitions in déjà vu, despite empirical research indicating that some déjà vu experiences involve a sense of knowing what will happen next.

**Phenomenology of Déjà Vu with Premonition:**

In the second part of his paper, Micali proposes an alternative phenomenological analysis focusing on déjà vu experiences involving premonitory feelings regarding the imminent future. He defines déjà vu as any subjectively inappropriate impression of familiarity with a present experience whose temporal context is not clearly localized, emphasizing its relevance to the future rather than just an indefinite past.

The author provides two case studies illustrating this form of déjà vu:

1. Emil Kraepelin's Peruvian expedition experience, where he felt not only familiarity but also knew exactly what was about to happen (the appearance of a bridge around the bend).
2. A personal account from T.G., who experienced déjà vu while entering a new pub in his town, anticipating a specific conversation with his friend Paul.

In both cases, Micali highlights the destabilizing nature of these experiences and their potential implications for understanding altered states of consciousness involving time perception. He suggests that these phenomena can be better understood through Husserl's phenomenology of time-consciousness rather than Bergson's, focusing on the conflictual overlapping between different temporal streams within consciousness.


Title: Husserl's Phenomenology of Time and the Analysis of Déjà Vu Experience

The article explores the phenomenological analysis of déjà vu experiences using Edmund Husserl's framework of time-consciousness. It argues that Husserl's distinction between retention, primary impression, and protention offers a more nuanced understanding of déjà vu than previous theories.

Key Points:

1. **Husserl's Categorical Framework**: The author highlights the strength of Husserl's phenomenological approach to time-consciousness, emphasizing its clear distinctions between retention (past experience held in mind), primary impression (the immediacy of the present moment), and protention (anticipation of future events).

2. **Critique of Universal Time-Consciousness**: The author questions Husserl's assumption of a single, invariant form of time-consciousness, arguing that various psychological phenomena (like schizophrenia, depression, prayer, and insomnia) suggest a more diverse structure.

3. **Déjà Vu as Anticipation**: The article contends that déjà vu should be understood primarily in terms of anticipatory processes rather than memory. It asserts that the core of déjà vu experiences lies in partially intuitively fulfilled protentions that do not correspond to general memories but to unique, contingent scenarios.

4. **Duplication of Consciousness Streams**: The author explains how déjà vu involves oscillation between two streams of consciousness: one focused on the actual perceptual horizon (our usual world) and another with anticipations that suddenly appear, then disappear. These protentions are directed towards a unique future scene that doesn't fit the temporal order.

5. **Husserl's Protention**: The paper uses Husserl’s notion of protention to explain déjà vu – it suggests that during these experiences, there is an overlap between partially intuitively fulfilled protentions and primary impressions (the immediate present).

6. **Methodological Remarks**: The authors emphasize the importance of phenomenologically precise articulation of lived experiences to correctly identify underlying mechanisms, contrasting with cognitive science approaches focusing on double perception, implicit memory, or neurological explanations.

The article underscores the significance of a detailed, phenomenological examination in understanding complex psychological phenomena like déjà vu, challenging traditional assumptions and offering fresh insights by drawing on Husserl's framework of time-consciousness.


### 05-The state of servitude_ Schleiermacher_s phenomenology of sin

Title: The state of servitude: Schleiermacher's phenomenology of sin

Author: Timo Helenius

Journal: International Journal of Philosophy and Theology

The article explores Friedrich Schleiermacher's understanding of sin within the context of his broader philosophical and phenomenological framework. Unlike traditional interpretations that view sin primarily through a Christian lens, Helenius argues that Schleiermacher's concept of sin is fundamentally phenomenological and not confined to a specific religious self-consciousness.

Key Points:

1. Schleiermacher's critique of original sin and his revision of Christian doctrines emerge from a more fundamental recasting of the concept of religion based on sensory self-consciousness.

2. Sin, for Schleiermacher, is not merely a negative state but a living "state of servitude" (Zustand der Knechtschaft) that pervades human existence at both individual and collective levels. This state is characterized by the domination of sensory self-consciousness over higher spiritual self-consciousness, preventing the unity of the latter with various determinations of sensory self-consciousness.

3. Sin, in Schleiermacher's phenomenology, is a natural state for human beings as they experience themselves as absolutely dependent on an "other" (etwas anderes) that provides the datum for their existence. This primordial receptivity forms the subject and shapes human consciousness, which includes the phenomenon of sin.

4. Schleiermacher posits that sin arises during life's course due to the self-interested or desiring grasp of the given world by natural sensory self-consciousness. This active receptivity results in a limiting weakness or powerlessness of God-consciousness, which is inherently sinful.

5. Schleiermacher's notion of religion diverges from traditional doctrinal understanding by focusing on the groundless ground of consciousness and the most common and highest human activity—not institutionalized religion or theology. Instead, religion is described as an "original unity" (ursprüngliche Einheit) that relates to life and aesthetic imagination, involving both active creative endeavor and passive receptivity.

6. The phenomenological "feeling of piety" (Gefühl der Pietät) is central to Schleiermacher's understanding of religion, which exposes the unique sphere that he assigns to it—the whole of human experience intuited through feeling. This peculiar sphere is not confined to any specific beliefs or practices but rather encompasses the living contact between humans and the world as an active domain of productivity and feeling.

7. Schleiermacher's concept of God (Gott) is tied to his understanding of the Whole, the Infinite, and the Eternal—not as divine attributes but as modes of consciousness distinct from conventional theological understandings. This conception emphasizes God-consciousness (Sich-seiner-selbst-als-in-Beziehung-mit-Gott-bewusst-Sein) as a form of self-awareness in relation to the divine.

8. Helenius argues that Schleiermacher's phenomenology of sin is rooted in his broader reconceptualization of religion, which prioritizes sensory self-consciousness and the feeling of piety over doctrinal formulations. This new understanding of sin reveals the fundamental nature of human existence as always already in a state of servitude (Knechtschaft) to the given world, even if it is not consciously experienced as such a negative state.

9. The article contends that Schleiermacher's phenomenology of sin offers a nuanced perspective on human existence and its inherent challenges, emphasizing the importance of understanding our dependence on the world and the role this dependence plays in shaping our self-consciousness and experiences.

10. By exploring Schleiermacher's phenomenology of sin, Helenius sheds light on the complex relationship between human existence, sensory perception, and spiritual consciousness while challenging traditional interpretations that reduce sin to a purely Christian self-conscious phenomenon.


Friedrich Schleiermacher's phenomenology of religion, as presented in his work "On Religion," posits a non-theological understanding of God. Instead of an idea or entity, God is viewed as the felt presence of the universe or the Whole, acknowledged through immediate consciousness. Schleiermacher's religious experience is characterized by having life and knowing life in immediate feeling, recognizing the existence of the infinite and eternal in all things.

This religious sensibility (Anschauung) is not identical to knowledge or science but rather an affection that reveals the Infinite in the finite. It's a form of life lived within the context of God, experiencing all things as possessed and present in God while simultaneously acknowledging God's presence in all things.

Schleiermacher distinguishes between objective consciousness (related to nature) and Christian religious self-consciousness (linked with the Redeemer). He argues that sin, or a turning away from God, is fundamentally tied to human existence due to our inherent sensory self-consciousness. This 'incurvatus in se' (turned within) results in an oscillation between striving for divine communion and succumbing to temptations arising from the sensual realm—a tension Schleiermacher sees as inescapable even after redemption.

His concept of sin is deeply intertwined with human self-consciousness. Sin isn't absolute; it continuously reappears despite conversion because of our natural, sensory-oriented existence. This ongoing struggle against temptation is a core aspect of religious life for Schleiermacher—an ever-present challenge in the "reign of God" that one must continually strive to overcome.

Schleiermacher's phenomenology is central to his understanding of religion and sin, with his theological ideas rooted in this exploratory, experiential framework rather than abstract metaphysical concepts. This approach allows him to propose a nuanced, processual view of human nature that accommodates the complexities of faith, sin, and redemption within the context of everyday experience.


### 05-Trust as the glue of cognitive institutions

The paper "Trust as the glue of cognitive institutions" by Shaun Gallagher and Enrico Petracca explores the nature of trust in economic institutions, particularly markets, from the perspective of extended and socially extended cognition. The authors argue that understanding trust is crucial for comprehending the dynamical workings of these institutions.

Three models of institutions are discussed: shared mental models (Denzau & North), extended mind (Clark), and socially extended mind (SEM). Shared mental models emphasize how individuals' internal representations, or mental models, create structures to interpret the environment and reduce uncertainty in human relations. The extended mind model focuses on external mechanisms that provide epistemic scaffolding, significantly reducing cognitive effort for information processing by externalizing processes. The SEM model goes further by incorporating active integration and recognizing that cognition may be a matter of shared communication shaped by normative practices.

Gallagher and Petracca then delve into the distinction between trust and reliability in institutional theory. They argue that while the extended-mind conception of scaffolding institutions can be framed in terms of information processing, it may not adequately capture trust as a criterion for mind extension when other agents are involved. Kathrine Hawley's proposal to distinguish between reliability and trustworthiness is particularly relevant here.

Reliability applies to impersonal resources (mechanisms, tools, or instruments), while trustworthiness pertains to interpersonal relations where assurance, responsibility, or obligation is involved. The authors suggest that the "trust and glue" criteria in extended-mind literature, which focus on reliability (availability, automatic endorsement, accessibility), do not account for trustworthiness.

In the context of cognitive institutions understood through the SEM model, intersubjective interaction and task dependency play essential roles in their formation and operation. These institutions function as sites of social and cultural practices with normative expectations and constraints that involve responsibility for carrying out tasks. Trustworthiness becomes an issue here because it is tied to autonomy, particularly relational autonomy – a form of autonomy enabled or constrained by social and normative factors.

The authors argue that trustworthiness goes beyond individual reliability; it also involves the role individuals play within these institutions. For instance, in legal proceedings, we trust not just an individual's autonomous behavior but also their ability to fulfill specific obligations or commitments voluntarily acquired. Similarly, in market relations, trust is directed towards individuals' adherence to shared rules and procedures.

The paper highlights the differences between reliability and trustworthiness by examining cases where institutions may be unreliable (e.g., due to metabolic states) but still trustworthy, as demonstrated by a Boeing case study involving misleading investors for improved company image. The authors conclude that contingencies connected with reliability can undermine the degree of trust in both individuals and institutions, potentially introducing inefficiencies and costs in market relations.

In summary, Gallagher and Petracca argue that understanding trust is crucial for comprehending the workings of cognitive institutions like markets. They propose that trustworthiness, involving autonomy and responsibility within intersubjective interactions and task dependencies, plays a vital role in these institutions' operation. This understanding differs from traditional notions of reliability, emphasizing that trust is necessary for the sustainability and functionality of cognitive institutions.


The text discusses the concept of trust within economic institutions, particularly focusing on markets, and its distinction from reliability. It begins by exploring different perspectives on trust, emphasizing its psychological complexity and its roots in primitive, affective, non-conceptual forms. 

The authors then introduce Adam Smith's views on self-interest as the driving force behind market transactions rather than benevolence or trust. Despite this, they argue that a more nuanced understanding of trust, as recognized by economists like Berg et al. (1995), is essential for comprehending markets fully. The historical context is crucial; while Smith lived in a market economy not yet characterized as capitalist, the advent of capitalism brought structural changes that transformed our understanding of trust and reliance.

The modern market scenario presents phenomena such as increased size, concentration of actors, intermediaries, and dematerialization, making Hawley's distinction between trust and reliance increasingly relevant for understanding contemporary markets. The text argues that when we speak of trusting or distrusting the market today, we're typically referring to its reliability rather than trust in individual actors. Market mechanisms are designed as reliable instruments of efficiency, embodying an "institutional design" perspective.

However, the paper also introduces an alternative paradigm—the relational paradigm—which underscores interpersonal relationships in markets. This approach identifies limitations in the mechanism-focused understanding of markets and highlights 'relational goods,' which include interpersonal experiences difficult for mechanisms to account for. 

The text then delves into the concept of institutional physiology, arguing that trust is a criterion for sustainable institutions. It critiques the idea that purely impersonal market mechanisms can extend cognition without necessitating interpersonal relationships or relational trust. The authors propose that reliance on such mechanisms can lead to pathologies like reification, counterperformativity, and institutional lockout, threatening institutional continuity and sustainability.

The 2008 financial crisis serves as an example where misplaced reliance and erosion of relational trust contributed significantly to the crisis's severity. The authors suggest that better communicative practices enabled by interpersonal relationships could have mitigated some aspects of the crisis, emphasizing the importance of relational trust in maintaining institutional cohesion.

The concluding remarks underscore the significance of trust as a glue-like ingredient in social institutions' constitution. Even though trust carries risks and unpredictability, it is deemed necessary for institutional sustainability. The paper argues that relying solely on the reliability of impersonal mechanisms can lead to various social pathologies and cognitive atrophy, undermining the endurance of institutions. 

In essence, this text bridges philosophical psychology and economic theory, particularly focusing on the role of trust within market-based systems. It critiques a purely mechanistic view of markets, advocating for the necessity of interpersonal relationships and relational trust in maintaining sustainable institutional arrangements.


Title 1: "The role of mentalizing and epistemic trust in the therapeutic relationship" by Fonagy, P., & Allison, E. (2014)

This paper explores the significance of mentalizing and epistemic trust within the context of psychotherapy. Mentalizing refers to the capacity to understand one's own and others' behaviors in terms of mental states, such as thoughts, feelings, and intentions. Epistemic trust pertains to the belief that another person will provide accurate information.

The authors argue that effective therapeutic relationships require a strong foundation of both mentalizing and epistemic trust. Mentalizing allows therapists to accurately interpret patients' behaviors, thoughts, and feelings, leading to a more nuanced understanding and empathetic response. Epistemic trust enables patients to confidently share their experiences with the therapist, knowing that they will be met with genuine curiosity and respect for their subjective realities.

The authors suggest that when these elements are present, the therapeutic relationship becomes a collaborative process where both parties can engage in mutual exploration and understanding. In turn, this facilitates patients' capacity to reflect on their inner worlds, develop new perspectives, and ultimately bring about psychological growth.

The paper further posits that mentalizing and epistemic trust can be cultivated through training and self-reflection, highlighting the importance of these elements for therapists' professional development.

Title 2: "How intrinsic motivation is crowded out and in" by Frey, B. S. (1994)

This article investigates the phenomenon where extrinsic rewards can undermine or replace intrinsic motivation. The author introduces the concept of 'crowding-out' – a process where the introduction of external incentives diminishes individuals' internal drive to engage in an activity for its inherent satisfaction.

Frey (1994) identifies two primary crowding-out mechanisms: (1) Overjustification effect, where external rewards lead people to assume they are performing an action because of the reward rather than their intrinsic interest; and (2) Internalization, where extrinsic incentives can transform an activity's value system for the individual.

The paper provides empirical evidence from various studies supporting these mechanisms, including a classic experiment by Lepper et al. (1973), which demonstrated that children's interest in drawing decreased when they were rewarded for it.

Frey (1994) also discusses the potential for 'crowding-in,' where external rewards can enhance intrinsic motivation, particularly under specific conditions such as when the reward signifies recognition or self-expression rather than control. The article concludes by outlining practical implications for education, workplaces, and other settings that aim to foster genuine engagement and commitment in individuals.

Title 3: "The socially extended mind" by Gallagher, S. (2013)

Gallagher (2013) presents the concept of a 'socially extended mind' that expands beyond the boundaries of an individual's brain to include tools and other people as integral components of cognitive processes. This perspective challenges traditional notions of autonomous, self-contained minds by highlighting how external elements can become seamlessly integrated into mental life.

The author introduces three key aspects of this extended mind: (1) Tool use – individuals can utilize tools to extend their cognitive abilities; (2) Social practices – human beings are inherently social, and interpersonal interactions significantly shape our thoughts and understanding; and (3) Collective intentionality – groups possess shared intentions that enable them to act cohesively towards common goals.

Gallagher (2013) uses various examples from everyday life and scientific literature to illustrate the concept, including language acquisition, scientific collaborations, and even the role of smartphones in cognitive functioning. He also discusses potential implications for understanding mental disorders, cognition, and social phenomena.

The paper concludes by emphasizing that recognizing our cognitive extensions beyond the brain can provide a more comprehensive understanding of human cognition and its complex interplay with culture and society.


### 06-A Kaleidoscope of play_ a new approach to play analysis in childhood

The article "A Kaleidoscope of play: a new approach to play analysis in childhood" by Laura Sparaci and Shaun Gallagher discusses the challenges in defining and analyzing childhood play. The authors argue that current approaches, which often rely on non-observable inner states or developmental stages, are limiting and hinder progress in understanding play.

The paper begins by presenting two main strategies for defining play: dispositional approaches, focusing on psychological dispositions like intrinsic motivation and engagement; and play types, categorizing observable behaviors into distinct play forms (e.g., exploratory, relational, functional, and pretend play). Both strategies face limitations. Dispositional approaches are useful for clarifying specific aspects of play once detected but struggle with parsing out ambiguous cases within a child's daily activities. Play types offer more detailed descriptions by grouping similar behaviors, yet their definitions often rely on non-observable inner states and are influenced by cultural factors.

The authors then critically examine the concept of pretend play as an illustration of these limitations. Pretend play is defined using various criteria (e.g., treating inanimate objects as animate), which may lead to a broad, "as-if" state definition, relying on symbolic thought and mental representations. This internalist perspective is problematic because it focuses on non-observable inner states rather than relational, in-the-world skills.

To overcome these limitations, Sparaci and Gallagher propose a shift from a stage-like progression to a gestalt view of play types. They argue that play types are better understood as characterized by dynamic juxtapositions and interactions between organismic, environmental, and task constraints rather than as stepwise maturational stages. This new perspective allows for co-existence and overlap within developmental stages and acknowledges the role of situated interaction in shaping play types.

The authors introduce the Kaleidoscope Model for play analysis, inspired by Karl M. Newell's work on motor skills. The model emphasizes the dynamic interplay between organism (body structure and function), environmental constraints (physical and social), and task space (goals and challenges) in shaping child play morphology. This enactive approach acknowledges creativity in play by recognizing that changes in these constraints lead to various play forms, which are not solely determined by the acquisition of specific skills or developmental stages.

In summary, Sparaci and Gallagher present a novel perspective on defining and analyzing childhood play. They argue against internalist definitions relying on non-observable inner states and instead advocate for an enactive approach that considers the organism, environment, and task constraints shaping play types. The Kaleidoscope Model offers a framework to understand the dynamic interplay between these factors in creating the diverse forms of childhood play.


The text discusses the role of various constraints in shaping child play, moving beyond traditional psychological models that often focus on cognitive skills and mental representations. It highlights three main types of constraints: organismic, environmental, and task.

1. Organismic Constraints: These refer to the biological and neurological aspects of a child, including their motor abilities, sensory capacities, and brain development. The ability to grasp and use objects, for instance, depends on factors like object size, a child's previous experiences, and maturation of specific neural pathways. The "aim game" played by children in the Okavango Delta is an example of how play can contribute to adult competencies, such as hunting.

2. Environmental Constraints: This category encompasses social, cultural, and material factors that influence play. Criticisms against developmental psychology suggest it has largely focused on Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies, neglecting diverse cultural practices and contexts. For instance, games involving projectiles or sowing-type games are found in various cultures worldwide. Social interactions significantly shape pretend play, with caregivers using multiple cues—facial expressions, gazes, movements, verbal behavior, and nonverbal noises—to facilitate children's understanding of unusual actions during pretend scenarios.

3. Task Constraints: Unlike Newell's model, which views task constraints as goals, rules, and implements that shape motor actions or response dynamics, this perspective acknowledges the flexible nature of child play. Rules in play are malleable, often set to "stage" a specific play scheme but quickly modified or abandoned during enactment. Organismic and environmental constraints shape task spaces while allowing for infinite creative combinations through enactive interactions within play.

To better capture these complex interplays between organismic, environmental, and task constraints, the authors propose the Kaleidoscope Model. This model represents organismic and environmental constraints as two reflective planes touching along a common edge, forming an angle that determines the task space. However, unlike traditional triangles with fixed boundaries, this kaleidoscopic structure allows for infinite combinations within the task space due to children's enactive creativity. Smaller angles between these reflective planes (i.e., fewer constraints) lead to more flexible task spaces and myriad possibilities for play scenarios.

In essence, the Kaleidoscope Model underscores that child play is deeply situated in-the-world, shaped by a dynamic interplay of biological, social, cultural, and material factors while fostering boundless creativity through enactive processes.


The text discusses a reconceptualization of play from traditional, linear models to a more holistic, dynamic Gestalt approach. This shift is advocated by Gallagher (2018) and is exemplified in the proposed Kaleidoscope Model for analyzing child play.

The Kaleidoscope Model suggests that play emerges from the interplay of multiple constraints: organismic, environmental, and task-related. These constraints are not static but dynamically interact, shaping the play experience without limiting its creativity. 

1. Organismic Constraints: These include physical characteristics (like body weight, height, shape), functional aspects (such as synaptic connections), and biomechanical changes (involving movement inertia due to growth). They are integral to a child's abilities and limitations during play.

2. Environmental Constraints: These are external factors like gravity, temperature, light, which provide the context within which play occurs. 

3. Task Constraints: Defined by the activity itself, these involve goals, rules, and tools that specify or limit response dynamics. 

The authors emphasize that viewing play through this lens prevents reducing it to children's internal mental states or symbolic processes, which might be unobservable. Instead, they argue for recognizing how play is a relationally constructed skill occurring in-the-world and actively shaped by these multiple dynamic relations.

The model also underscores the importance of subjective experiences within play, stating that these are not artificially initiated or constructed within a child's head but rather co-constituted through possibilities, opportunities, and constraints involving body, others, environment, and play itself. 

In essence, this perspective advocates for an enactive approach to understanding play - one that acknowledges the intertwining of mind, body, and world in shaping a child's play experiences. The Kaleidoscope Model aims to foster a new way of observing and defining play types in developmental psychology by paying attention to elements often overlooked in current literature. 

The model encourages researchers to consider play not just as isolated events but as complex, constantly rearranging patterns influenced by various constraints in the child-world interaction. This holistic view can provide a richer understanding of the diverse forms of play observed across different cultures and developmental stages.


### 06-Disturbance_ Coping_ and Innovation_ A Phenomenology of Terror

Title: Disturbance, Coping, and Innovation: A Phenomenology of Terror
Authors: Nicholas Zingale & Ralph Hummel
Journal: Administrative Theory & Praxis (Volume 30, Issue 2, 2008)

Summary:

In this article, Nicholas Zingale and Ralph Hummel explore the concept of terror as a phenomenon that permeates everyday life rather than being an isolated event. They propose a "normalcy theory" of terror, suggesting that our responses to small disturbances in daily coping can provide insights into countering larger-scale terrorism.

The authors begin by questioning if terror is an escape from reality or if it's already present in the fabric of normal life. They reference Martin Heidegger and Hubert Dreyfus to describe recovery from breaches in everyday life and work, focusing on the concepts of coping, theorizing, and contemplation.

1. Anxiety, Fear, and Hope: The authors discuss terror's twins—anxiety and fear—and their godfather, hope. They argue that anxiety and fear are inherent to human existence as described by phenomenology. Terror exposes our essential vulnerability, forcing us to confront the fragility of socially constructed realities and the unwarranted acts that build cultural architectures.

2. Coping: Zingale and Hummel differentiate between mindless everyday coping and authentic coping. Mindless coping involves adherence to societal norms, while authentic coping entails confronting existential anxieties through contemplation. They use Heidegger's concept of "contemplation" as a means of revealing the nature of human existence and its world.

3. Contemplation: Contemplation is described as a mode of being that reveals our experience with the world, emphasizing that it should not be merely theoretical but an active engagement in understanding one's situation. The authors argue that contemplation, when practiced in the face of terror, can help uncover opportunities for new knowledge and know-how, enabling individuals to become fully engaged with the problem at hand.

4. Normalcy: Zingale and Hummel propose that terror is an amplification or enlargement of everyday disruptions and disturbances in social force. By unsettling daily lives, terror forces individuals to confront both socially contrived insecurities and existential anxieties. Contemplation serves as a method for revealing new ways of being in the world, allowing us to reassess existing norms and find unique possibilities for action.

5. Movement in the Terror War: The authors observe changes in response to terrorism, from fleeing or trembling (inaction) to fighting (active resistance). They argue that as individuals become aware of the whole and fit their actions into a practical context, societal norms can evolve. Heroic acts previously considered uncommon can become common virtues in the face of terrorism.

6. Attack on Norms: The authors challenge modern assumptions underpinning our worldview—rationality superior to irrationality, the power of technology, and human freedom, among others. They assert that terrorists expose these self-delusions by demonstrating vulnerabilities in seemingly secure systems, thereby heightening dread and forcing society to reassess its foundational beliefs.

In conclusion, Zingale and Hummel's article encourages a phenomenological understanding of terror as an opportunity for growth and change rather than merely a threat. By embracing contemplation and authentic coping, individuals can transcend inauthentic norms that enable terrorism and foster resilience against extremist acts.


The text is a philosophical analysis of terrorism and coping mechanisms from a phenomenological perspective, written by Nicholas Zingale and Ralph Hummel. It critiques the conventional understanding of vulnerability and coping, arguing that modern society's emphasis on security and control obscures our inherent insecurity as human beings.

The authors propose a new conceptualization of vulnerability based on phenomenology, focusing not just on the capacity to respond to external stressors but also on our inability to discover the foundations of our existence. They suggest that terrorism thrives in societies where individuals have lost faith in their norms and self, leading to a constant state of hidden wounding or anxiety.

To address this issue, they introduce the concept of coping modes derived from Heidegger's philosophy:

1. Absorbed (conspicuousness): This is the basic mode where simple alternatives are available without challenging one's fundamental assumptions.
2. Deliberate-deliberation (obstinacy): When faced with a more significant disturbance, this mode requires dealing with the problem within the context of one's skills and abilities. It involves mental content arising due to the need for deliberate attention.
3. Obtrusiveness (total breakdown): This mode occurs when the tool or situation resists completely, leading to detachment and theoretical reflection. Here, the focus shifts from dealing with the world in practical ways to analyzing it scientifically.
4. Contemplation: A fourth mode introduced by Heidegger, contemplation involves "seeing" without trying to understand what is seen but simply to see beings as they are, uncovering 'being' itself.

The authors argue that a phenomenological approach to understanding terrorism can reveal hidden openings for change and foster an authentic self in a world without normative standards. They propose a "normative theory without norms," emphasizing free will, spontaneity, and commitment to the consequences of our existence and actions rather than rigid rules or standards.

In summary, Zingale and Hummel present a nuanced phenomenological perspective on terrorism and coping mechanisms that challenges conventional wisdom. They advocate for a more flexible, open-ended approach to understanding vulnerability and adapting to disturbances by embracing contemplation and the freedom to discover new ways of being in the world.


### 06-Kant_s and Husserl_s agentive and proprietary accounts of cognitive phenomenology

Julia Jansen's paper "Kant's and Husserl's agentive and proprietary accounts of cognitive phenomenology" explores how Kantian and Husserlian philosophies contribute to the contemporary debate on cognitive phenomenology. The author challenges assumptions within this debate, particularly those that reduce phenomenal consciousness to sensory or quasi-sensory content.

Kant's perspective is drawn from his concepts of inner sense and transcendental apperception:

1. Inner Sense: Kant views inner sense as a mode of intuitive self-awareness, where one becomes aware of mental presentations by making an effort to become conscious of them. This effort is an intellectual act of the understanding rather than a purely perceptual process. Attention plays a crucial role in this context: it allows for the synthesis of sensory content into intentional, temporal objects, which are essential for phenomenal consciousness.
2. Transcendental Apperception: Kant posits that for presentations to become phenomenally aware, they must be thinkable and self-attributable as one's own. This self-attribution is a form of explicit awareness of oneself as an active thinker, connecting agentive and proprietary dimensions of thinking within cognitive phenomenology.

Husserl's account contributes to the debate through his notions of lived experience (Erlebnis) and self-awareness:

1. Active and Passive Syntheses: Husserl distinguishes between active and passive modes of consciousness, where active syntheses involve an "I" explicitly as the doer, and passive syntheses refer to activities in which consciousness participates without being steered by an "I." Attention is identified as both active (turning towards objects with a teleological striving) and passive (being caught or drawn by objects).
2. Empty Intensions: Husserl's account of empty intentions allows thoughts to make constitutive contributions to phenomenal character, even when they lack intuitive fulfillment. Experiences of truth, where thought is explicitly understood as fulfilled by corresponding perceptions, introduce a normative dimension into the phenomenological content.

Jansen argues that both Kant and Husserl's views challenge assumptions within cognitive phenomenology debates:

1. Cognitive phenomenology should encompass more than just thinking—it includes perceiving, judging, etc., as perceived and conceptual content cannot be separated from intentional and phenomenal aspects.
2. Conscious thought has its own irreducible phenomenal qualities that go beyond the narrow understanding of cognitive experiences as unitary or thought-focused.
3. The debate tends to overlook the agentive (experiencing one's behaviors as one's own actions) and proprietary dimensions (owning thoughts) inherent in thinking, which play essential roles in our phenomenal experience of cognition.

In summary, Jansen's paper highlights how Kantian and Husserlian perspectives offer valuable insights into the nature of cognitive phenomenology by emphasizing agentive and proprietary aspects of thinking. These accounts challenge contemporary assumptions within the field and call for a broader understanding of cognitive phenomenology that acknowledges various modes of consciousness and their phenomenal qualities.

### 06-Phenomenology_ a powerful tool for patient-centered rehabilitation

The article "Phenomenology: a powerful tool for patient-centered rehabilitation" by Bruce Greenfield and Gail M. Jensen discusses the application of phenomenology, a philosophical framework and methodology, to enhance understanding in patient-centered rehabilitation.

Phenomenology, primarily derived from Edmund Husserl's work, is a philosophy that explores how individuals make sense of their experiences. Central concepts include consciousness, intentionality, and the lifeworld. Consciousness refers to the ongoing stream of thoughts, images, beliefs, memories, and feelings in an individual's mind. Intentionality is the process through which consciousness directs itself towards objects or experiences, constituting a reality. The lifeworld represents the meaning one derives from their existence within the world.

The authors argue that phenomenology is crucial for healthcare professionals to understand patients' lived experiences of disability, as it focuses on subjective interpretations rather than objective data. This aligns with patient-centered care's emphasis on individual perspectives and contexts in understanding impairment and limitations.

Phenomenology can help clinicians gain insights into changes in patients' temporal and spatial relationships post-injury or disease. For example, following a spinal cord injury, an individual's sense of time (inner time) may differ from objective time, with pain experiences altering their perception of time intervals.

The phenomenological attitude contrasts with the natural attitude—the disengaged, unreflective manner individuals typically navigate the world. Entering a phenomenological attitude requires doubt in one's understanding of the world and adopting new awareness of posing the world. This shift is essential when working with patients who experience major injuries or diseases, as their natural attitude may become fragmented, leading to fear, confusion, loss of self, and identity shifts.

Phenomenology emphasizes embodiment—viewing human experiences as fundamentally embodied rather than mind-body separate entities. Changes in kinesthetic sensation after neurological insults can be understood within the patient's lifeworld as changes in their sense of embodiment, sometimes resulting in a feeling of disembodiment following catastrophic injuries or illnesses.

In summary, phenomenology offers healthcare professionals a powerful tool to explore patients' subjective experiences of disability and illness. By focusing on the lifeworld, intentionality, and embodiment, clinicians can gain valuable insights into patients' lived realities, ultimately enriching rehabilitation practice and promoting patient-centered care.


The text discusses the application of phenomenology, a research methodology that focuses on understanding lived experiences, to gain deeper insights into the impacts of life-changing illnesses and disabilities. Phenomenological studies, which often involve in-depth interviews, focus groups, personal journal analysis, and observations, have revealed significant psychosocial issues related to these conditions. 

1. **Embodiment Changes**: Studies like Sally Gadow's on stroke patients have shown a phenomenon of 'disrupted immediacy' where individuals experience their bodies as physically disconnected. Some even enter a stage of disembodiment, where the self feels opposed to the body. Over time, this can lead to a revised sense of embodiment through active reconstruction and revision.

2. **Redefining Identity**: Research by Carpenter on spinal cord injury patients reveals that rehabilitation involves more than just skill acquisition; it's about redefining one's identity in the context of their new reality. Patients need to challenge stereotypes and see disability as a part of their lives, not its entirety.

3. **Re-embodiment Process**: Papadimitriou’s work on individuals using wheelchairs post spinal cord injury introduces the concept of 'becoming en-wheeled'. This term encapsulates their existential and embodied experience of navigating life in a new way, which goes beyond mere mechanics or practicality.

4. **Stigma and Disability**: Phenomenological research underscores the profound impact of stigma on self-identity among individuals with disabilities. Stigma, rooted in societal perceptions of impairment as 'damage' requiring extra effort to achieve 'normality', can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization. 

5. **Clinical Implications**: These findings suggest that phenomenology can enrich patient-centered care by making explicit what's often implicit or hidden—patients' sense of re-embodiment, altered spatial and temporal perceptions, identity transformations, and experiences of stigma. Clinicians should embrace mindful practice (being fully present and attuned to patients' narratives) and reflect on conscious experience to better understand their patients' lived realities.

6. **Innovative Tools**: Researchers are developing phenomenology-based tools like the Recovery Preference Model (RPE), which integrates quantitative measures with qualitative understanding of a patient's perspective on recovery, and phenomenological video analysis, allowing patients to interpret and give meaning to their own bodily movements.

In conclusion, phenomenology offers a valuable approach for physical therapists to understand the complex, subjective experiences of patients with disabilities, fostering more holistic, patient-centered care.

### 06-Psychotherapy of the oppressed_ the education of Paulo Freire in dialogue with phenomenology

The article "Psychotherapy of the Oppressed: The Education of Paulo Freire in Dialogue with Phenomenology" explores the intersection of phenomenological psychopathology, values-based practice, and the educational philosophy of Paulo Freire to propose a new paradigm for mental health.

Paulo Freire (1921-1997), a Brazilian educator, was a prominent figure in critical pedagogy. He criticized the traditional "banking model" of education, where students are treated as passive recipients of information, and advocated for a dialogical approach that fosters liberation and empowerment.

In his masterpiece, "Pedagogy of the Oppressed," Freire presented his alternative educational methodology, which he termed "problem-posing education." This model aims to create an intersubjective space for dialogue between teacher and student, where both engage in critical reflection about their world. It's a process that expands consciousness by focusing on hidden aspects of life, promoting critical thinking, autonomy, and authenticity.

Freire’s pedagogy emphasizes praxis – the unity of theory and action – and is built around themes derived from people's lived experiences (limit-situations). This methodology has been applied in various fields beyond education, including health promotion and therapy.

The authors argue that Freire’s ideas are relevant to phenomenological psychopathology and values-based practice, which aim to reduce situations of epistemic injustice and oppression in mental health. They propose a "Psychotherapy of the Oppressed," which integrates Freire's dialogical approach with phenomenological insights.

The article highlights three main contributions of Freire's philosophy to mental health:

1. Challenging the "banking model" of therapy prevalent in contemporary mental health practice, which reduces patients to passive recipients of treatment (medication or psychotherapy). The authors argue that this approach undervalues patients' autonomy and perpetuates power dynamics, leading to hermeneutical injustice.

2. Critiquing the epistemic injustices present in clinical encounters. Freire's work provides a framework for understanding how oppressed individuals may internalize dominant narratives or lack the vocabulary and resources to express their experiences, which can lead to marginalization and hermeneutical injustice.

3. Emphasizing the importance of acknowledging power structures and historical context within mental health research and practice. Freire's approach encourages clinicians to engage with diverse perspectives, incorporating patients' voices into research and fostering a culture of trust that allows for open dialogue about lived experiences.

The authors propose integrating Freire’s methodology with contemporary phenomenological psychopathology, specifically through co-production or collaborative fieldwork methods. This would enable the recognition of implicit categories and personal values shaping individuals' mental health experiences while actively engaging in social transformation.

In conclusion, the article suggests that adopting Freire's dialogical pedagogy within phenomenological psychopathology can lead to a more ethical, therapeutic, and socially transformative approach to mental health care, particularly for marginalized populations.


The text discusses a critique of contemporary mental health practices, arguing that they often adopt a "banking model" of therapy where the clinician holds epistemic resources and knowledge, while the patient is positioned as a receiver. This relationship is seen as prone to epistemic injustices, as it leaves little room for an investigation of lived experiences or exchange of worldviews.

The authors propose a phenomenologically oriented psychotherapy that acknowledges social aspects constituting lived experience. They draw from Paulo Freire's methodology, which consists of three main steps: thematic investigation, coding and decoding, and unveiling the world. These steps are intended to help clinicians consider power dynamics and create a dialogical environment for mutual investigation based on dialogue.

Two possible paths for integrating phenomenological psychopathology and psychotherapy with Freire's ideas are outlined:

1. Incorporating "culture circles" in clinical research, which combines phenomenological investigation of lived experience with Freire's approach. This method could enhance knowledge on the relationship between transcendental structures (like temporality or spatiality) and values, while avoiding situations of epistemic injustice typically associated with psychiatric research. It aligns with current projects promoting co-production and democratic participation.

2. Developing a "psychotherapy of the oppressed" that draws from dialogical psychotherapy, using phenomenology, hermeneutics, and dialogue as fundamental tools. This approach emphasizes the patient's limit-situations (moments where one's philosophy of life and attitude towards the world are threatened) as starting points for critical reflection on reality. The therapist aids in this process through attentive listening, helping patients understand how sociocultural factors contribute to their experiences without overwhelming or offending them.

The ultimate goal is to create a "praxis of freedom" mental health paradigm that frees all actors and stakeholders from constraints, reducing opportunities for injustice and oppression in the therapeutic encounter. The authors use a case study of Sabrina, a Brazilian woman experiencing depressive symptoms and anxiety attacks due to overwork and societal pressures, to illustrate this approach.

Throughout the process, the clinician must be attentive, using the patient's language and concrete examples, while respecting their worldview. This nearly pedagogical relationship allows for the incorporation of clinicians' knowledge into patients' values and experiences without imposing preordered answers or a mere transfer of knowledge. Instead, it fosters a collaborative therapy where both patient and therapist are engaged in building a shared understanding of reality and potential solutions to the patient's distress.


### 07-A phenomenology of competition

In this essay, Scott Kretchmar employs Husserl's transcendental phenomenology to analyze the nature of competition. He outlines a series of steps for a phenomenological analysis, focusing on noetic (acts) and noematic (objects) correlates of competitive projects. The essay explores four central features of competition: plurality, normativity, disputation, and temporality, and identifies three forms of pseudo or defective competition.

1. Plurality: Competition is grounded in the difference between singularity and plurality, requiring at least two parties to compare and contrast their actions or outcomes. The absence of a second party prevents meaningful comparison and thus, defeats the purpose of competition.

2. Normativity: Beyond simple description, competitions involve normative judgments about better and worse performances. This evaluation is essential for understanding competition as a form of agonistic striving.

3. Disputation: A crucial component of competition is the commitment to superiority in an argument or dispute with one or more opponents. Without this mutual engagement, there can be no genuine contest.

4. Temporality: The act of contesting has a temporal aspect, as participants must make their efforts within a specific timeframe. Disputation is time-sensitive and requires an antecedent commitment to superiority before the event takes place.

Kretchmar then considers pseudo or defective competitions, focusing on three controversial claims: competing with animals, oneself, and imaginary opponents, as well as absentee adversaries. He concludes that eidetic analyses like the one presented in this essay have utility despite their limitations.

In summary, Kretchmar's phenomenological analysis of competition highlights essential features such as plurality, normativity, disputation, and temporality. By identifying these elements, he argues that competition is characterized by a comparative evaluation within a shared project, involving a mutual commitment to superiority in an argumentative context, taking place over time, and requiring at least two parties for meaningful comparison. The essay also raises questions about the validity of certain competitive scenarios, such as competing with animals or absent opponents, indicating areas where further phenomenological reflection is needed.


The text is a philosophical exploration of the concept of competition, drawing on phenomenology, particularly Edmund Husserl's ideas. The author, Scott Kretchmar, discusses various forms of competitions, including human-animal interactions, self-competition, and competition against absent or invisible opponents.

1. Human-Animal Competition: Kretchmar raises the question whether animals can participate in a competition with humans due to their cognitive abilities. While it's unclear if they possess the necessary consciousness for recognizing a problem, appreciating its importance, or intending superiority, he suggests that there could be a framework for a contest based on intuitive understanding of problems. However, empirical evidence related to animal cognition is crucial here, which Husserl's phenomenological reductions aim to bracket or set aside.

2. Self-Competition: Kretchmar distinguishes between self-improvement and competition with oneself. He argues that while a person can intend to improve their performance over time (self-improvement), it might be misleading to call this a contest, as there's no direct comparison or dispute. However, he acknowledges an exception where imaginary competitors are involved – for instance, a child playing as multiple athletes, each trying to outperform the others. Here, the conditions of competition (plurality of actors, comparison, evaluation, and upfront disputation) seem met, though it's still a form of play-acting rather than a real contest due to the single person enacting all roles.

3. Competition Against Absentee Opponents: Kretchmar explores two scenarios involving absent opponents - temporal (one athlete preceding another) and spatial (athletes at different locations). He concludes that such competitions are possible in closed or parallel activities like bowling or golf, where the test is independent of the opponent. However, these contests have limitations: participants lack specific knowledge about their rivals' performances, which prevents them from fully engaging in relative success comparisons and strategic adjustments that characterize robust competitions. This leads to a diminished experience compared to concurrent, face-to-face disputations preferred by athletes and fans alike.

The author concludes by suggesting that while eidetic analyses can reveal some aspects of competition, they may be limited in capturing the rich complexity and nuances of competitive experiences. He proposes a balanced approach, combining eidetic analysis with an existential perspective to better describe sports' varied and intricate phenomena. Overall, Kretchmar's work demonstrates how phenomenology can contribute to understanding complex human activities like competition.


### 07-Arendt_ Am_ry_ and the Phenomenology of Evil

Sidra Shahid's article, "Arendt, Améry, and the Phenomenology of Evil," published in the Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology, explores a phenomenology of evil by comparing Hannah Arendt and Jean Améry's conceptions. Both philosophers address how totalitarian regimes destroy subjectivity and undermine trust in the world, but they differ in their focus on the subject who undergoes evil.

Arendt introduces the term "radical evil," which she discusses in her work Origins of Totalitarianism and further develops in Eichmann in Jerusalem. Radical evil aims to make human beings superfluous through three stages:

1. Destruction of the juridical person, eradicating legal status and protections (e.g., Nuremberg Laws).
2. Degradation of the moral person by making subjects complicit in evil acts, weakening solidarity.
3. Elimination of spontaneity, rendering individuals reflexive, indistinguishable "bundles of reactions," and superfluous.

Arendt argues that totalitarian regimes' brutalities render their motives incomprehensible, suggesting a moral gap between perpetrators and victims. She later critiques this radical evil by examining the "banality of evil" through the case of Adolf Eichmann, whose seemingly shallow motivations led to catastrophic outcomes due to his internalization of Hitler's law (Führerprinzip). This internalization resulted in a distorted moral framework that replaced self-legislation with obedience to the leader's will.

Améry, on the other hand, emphasizes the subject who undergoes evil and foregrounds their lived experiences as essential to understanding what makes an act of violence an atrocity. In At the Mind's Limits, Améry recounts his torture by the Gestapo, illustrating how embodied subjects experience evil. He argues that the radical destruction of a subject's trust in the world is central to understanding torture as an act of evil.

Shahid contends that both Arendt and Améry share the view that evil undermines subjectivity and trust in the world, but they differ in their focus on the victim's standpoint. While Arendt discusses perpetrators' motivations and distorted moral frameworks, she leaves implicit the experiential dimension of suffering. Améry, however, underscores the necessity of considering this first-person experience to grasp the true nature of evil acts.

Shahid argues that a phenomenology of evil must engage with both aspects – perpetrators' distorted moral frameworks and victims' lived experiences of suffering. By bringing Arendt's and Améry's perspectives into conversation, Shahid aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon of evil that accounts for its experiential dimension.


The text discusses Jean Améry's phenomenological account of evil, focusing on his experiences as a victim of torture during the National Socialist regime. Améry distinguishes between two types of experiences: primary experience (direct encounter) and imagination (mental representation). He argues that while imagination can vividly picture an event, it remains distinct from and incommensurable with primary experience.

Améry's lived experience of arrest reveals the discrepancy between his imaginings and reality – the car is different, the sensation of shackles unanticipated, and familiar streets appear strange when crossed as a prisoner. This distinction underscores that imagination pictures events while primary experience immerses one in them without modification.

Améry's phenomenological standpoint emphasizes the primacy of primary experiences for understanding evil. Initially, he imagined Gestapo officers as monstrous, yet upon arrest, they appeared ordinary. Only through the primary experience of torture does Améry perceive that their banality belies an extraordinary evil.

The text also examines Améry's critique of Hannah Arendt's concept of "banal evil." Améry asserts that Arendt, who observed Eichmann from a courtroom setting rather than directly experiencing the consequences of his choices in concentration camps, fails to grasp the true nature of evil. Améry insists that to recognize a perpetrator's evil, one must consider the primary experiences of those who suffered under their actions.

Améry's phenomenology of trust plays a central role in his account of evil. Trust encompasses metaphysical, logical, epistemic, and intersubjective certainties that render our world reliable and intelligible. Torture, according to Améry, destroys this transcendental trust by breaching boundaries between self and other, shattering one's faith in the protective capacity of their body, and foreclosing any possibility for aid or intervention.

The impairment of trust due to torture results in a loss of faith in the world as reliable and intelligible, leading to a form of derealization that undermines our perceptions at a fundamental level. Améry's perspective on evil bears resemblance to Arendt's concept of radical evil: both describe how evil renders human beings superfluous by destroying spontaneity and plurality, reducing victims to mere reflexes or bundles of reactions.

Améry also explores the torturer's mentality, arguing that while they may appear as "brutalized petty bourgeois and subordinate bureaucrats," their actions reveal a form of existential sadism – a transposition of what social existence ordinarily requires. The torturer aims to nullify the world and realize total sovereignty by negating fellow humans, thereby destroying conditions that enable access to a common and intelligible world.

In summary, Améry's phenomenological account of evil highlights the primary experience of suffering as crucial for understanding the true nature of atrocities. Through granular descriptions of his own experiences, Améry underscores how torture fundamentally distorts intersubjective relationships and undermines our trust in the world, revealing a radical destruction of subjectivity that is central to National Socialism's ideology.


1. Tyner, Andrew H. "Action, Judgment, and Imagination in Hannah Arendt's Thought." Political Research Quarterly 70 (2017): 523-34.

This article by Andrew H. Tyner explores Hannah Arendt's philosophical concepts of action, judgment, and imagination, and how they interconnect in her political thought. Tyner argues that for Arendt, these elements are essential to understanding human existence, particularly within a political context.

Action, according to Arendt, is the basic mode of human behavior, distinguished from labor or work. It involves coming together with others and engaging in a shared world, which Tyner interprets as a form of collective intentionality. Judgment, for Arendt, is the faculty that allows humans to make sense of the world and orient themselves within it. Imagination, on the other hand, is crucial for envisioning new possibilities and creating a shared world of meaning.

Tyner further discusses how these concepts are interconnected in Arendt's thought. He posits that imagination enables us to make judgments about the world and take action based on those judgments. Furthermore, action itself requires judgment to evaluate its outcomes and imagine future possibilities. This dynamic triad of action, judgment, and imagination is central to Arendt's political philosophy, emphasizing the importance of public engagement, collective decision-making, and shared understanding in politics.

2. Utley, Fiona. "Considerations Towards A Phenomenology of Trust." Symposium 18 (2014): 194-214.

In this article, Fiona Utley examines the phenomenon of trust from a phenomenological perspective. She argues that trust is often overlooked in philosophical discussions and seeks to establish a foundational understanding of trust as a lived experience. 

Utley begins by distinguishing between two types of trust: factive trust (trust based on evidence or knowledge) and non-factive trust (trust without explicit evidence). She then explores how these forms of trust manifest in our everyday lives, focusing on the role of imagination in creating a sense of security and predictability. 

The author suggests that trust involves an anticipatory element, where we imagine future scenarios based on past experiences. This imaginative projection enables us to 'step into' potential situations, making them feel familiar and, thus, trustworthy. 

Utley also discusses the role of vulnerability in trust. She posits that trusting involves opening oneself up to potential harm or disappointment, yet this risk is essential for human connection and collective action. By sharing vulnerabilities, individuals can form bonds of trust, fostering mutual understanding and cooperation.

3. Villa, Dana. "Genealogies of Total Domination: Arendt, Adorno, and Auschwitz." New German Critique 34 (2007): 1-45.

In this piece, Dana Villa explores the concept of total domination through the lens of Hannah Arendt and Theodor W. Adorno, focusing on their responses to Auschwitz and the Holocaust. 

Villa begins by outlining Adorno's critical theory, which views total domination as an inherent feature of modern society, manifesting in various forms such as instrumental reason, bureaucracy, and mass culture. She then turns to Arendt's critique of this domination, arguing that Arendt's concept of labor and her emphasis on the importance of action and appearance in public life offer a different perspective.

For Arendt, total domination emerges when labor - characterized by its alienating nature - comes to dominate human existence, reducing individuals to mere resources. Villa contends that Auschwitz exemplifies this trend, as the concentration camp system turned human life into a form of labor, devoid of any intrinsic value or public recognition.

However, Arendt also offers a hopeful note, asserting that political action can counteract total domination by re-affirming the unique dignity and publicness of individuals. Through collective engagement, people can resist the forces of labor and create spaces of freedom and appearance. 

4. Wittgenstein, Ludwig. On Certainty. Trans. Denis Paul and G.E.M. Anscombe. Oxford: Blackwell, 1975.

In "On Certainty," Ludwig Wittgenstein presents his later philosophical views on knowledge, belief, and doubt. The work is structured as a dialogue between an interlocutor (I) and the philosopher himself (W), who explores various topics related to certainty.

Wittgenstein argues against the idea of absolute certainty, claiming that our beliefs are not derived from self-evident propositions but rather from practices and habits embedded in our everyday lives. He introduces the concept of "side remarks," stating that many of our convictions are expressed through such remarks, which lack the status of propositions yet guide our actions.

Moreover, Wittgenstein distinguishes between knowing how (e.g., riding a bicycle) and knowing that (e.g., mathematical truths). He suggests that our knowledge of the external world is not based on logical deduction but rather on practical skills and linguistic practices.

5. Yeatman, Anna. "Politics and Personal Responsibility: Reflections on Jean Améry and Hannah Arendt." In On Jean Améry: Philosophy of Catastrophe. Ed. Magdalena Zolkos. New York: Lexington, 2014.

Anna Yeatman's article compares the political thought of Jean Améry and Hannah Arendt, focusing on their views about personal responsibility within a broader political context. 

Améry, a Holocaust survivor, grappled with the concept of guilt and complicity in the face of atrocity. Yeatman argues that Améry's philosophy emphasizes individual moral responsibility, asserting that bystanders share culpability for failing to act against injustice. This perspective is rooted in his belief that silence or indifference can be a form of complicity, perpetuating oppressive systems.

On the other hand, Arendt's political philosophy stresses collective responsibility and action. She posits that politics emerges from the coming together of individuals in public spaces, where they engage in deliberation and decision-making. For Arendt, political action requires not only moral integrity but also the willingness to participate in shared affairs.

Yeatman highlights how both thinkers, despite their differences, converge on the importance of personal responsibility in confronting political evils. She suggests that Améry's emphasis on individual guilt and Arendt's call for collective action can complement each other, offering a more comprehensive understanding of moral obligation within politics.


### 07-Blumenberg and the Mythology of the Lifeworld_ A Deconstructive Reading of Husserl_s Phenomeno

In this scholarly article titled "Blumenberg and the Mythology of the Lifeworld: A Deconstructive Reading of Husserl's Phenomenology," Yutong Li delves into a unique interpretation of Edmund Husserl's phenomenological concept of the lifeworld through the lens of Hans Blumenberg's philosophy. The article is structured in two parts, with the first focusing on Blumenberg's reinterpretation of Husserl's notion of the lifeworld and the second exploring how this interpretation relates to Blumenberg's theory of mythology.

**Part I: Blumenbergian phenomenology of lifeworld**

1. **Husserl's Lifeworld**: Husserl introduced the concept of the lifeworld in his later work, "The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology," as a remedy for the crisis he saw in scientific practices that prioritize mathematical formulas over lived experiences. The lifeworld is described as an intuitive realm of self-evident truths, pre-predicative and uninformed by language or rational thought.

2. **Blumenberg's Critique**: Blumenberg challenges Husserl's notion of the lifeworld, arguing that it inherently carries mythical connotations despite Husserl's attempt to present it as a foundation for scientific rationality. Blumenberg identifies the lifeworld's pre-predicative nature and its association with naivety as mythical elements, which he highlights through his reading of Husserl's "Experience and Judgement."

3. **Lifeworld vs. Logos**: The author presents an immanent critique of the lifeworld by revealing its contradictory relationship with language (logos). Blumenberg argues that, while logos requires language for expression, phenomena (the lifeworld) exist independently of it, thereby creating a tension between description and "things themselves."

4. **The Lifeworld as Expressionless**: In Blumenberg's view, the lifeworld is an expressionless state, reminiscent of mythical naivety or the silent thing in nature. The term "ausdruckslos" (inexpressed) highlights this enigmatic quality, suggesting a pre-linguistic, unquestioned foundation for human experience and knowledge.

**Part II: Myth and the Phenomenology of its Reception**

1. **Blumenberg's Philosophy of Mythology**: Blumenberg's approach to mythology is characterized by a challenge to the conventional opposition between myth and reason, reevaluating the value of myth as essential for understanding human reality. He emphasizes the light-heartedness and lack of univocity inherent in myths, which allows for multiple interpretations and dynamic understandings over time.

2. **Myth as Aesthetic Expression**: Blumenberg views myths as closely related to the phenomenological concept of lifeworld due to their pre-logic nature and capacity to capture the unquestioned, "obvious" aspects of human experience. The lifeworld can be understood as an aesthetic expression of mythical thinking.

3. **Myth as Reception**: Blumenberg's philosophy of mythology underscores the act of reception as integral to the nature of mythic writing and understanding. Myths are not static texts but evolve through repeated retelling, interpretation, and application by successive generations, embodying a sense of historical continuity or "trace."

4. **Mythology and Lifeworld**: By combining Blumenberg's philosophy of mythology with his critique of Husserl's lifeworld, Li suggests that the lifeworld itself can be understood as a mythological notion, characterized by its unquestioned familiarity, instantaneous evidence, and resistance to rational scrutiny. In this light, Blumenberg's philosophy of mythology provides a unique deconstructive reading of Husserl's phenomenology, highlighting the persistent role of myths in shaping human understanding and experience.

In conclusion, Yutong Li presents an original interpretation that illuminates the lifeworld as sustained by myths and their receptions, merging Blumenberg's philosophical thought with Husserl's phenomenology. By employing deconstructive strategies, Li uncovers a previously overlooked mythological dimension within


Title: The Phenomenology of Mythology: Blumenberg's Approach to the Lifeworld and Reception

The passage discusses Hans Blumenberg's philosophical perspective on mythology, emphasizing his unique take on its relationship with the lifeworld and reception. It highlights how Blumenberg's thought diverges from traditional interpretations of myth as either a primal fear or a poetic creation by humanity.

1. Mythology as a phenomenological study: The essay begins by noting that Blumenberg's approach to mythology is rooted in phenomenology—the study of structures of experience and consciousness. It stresses the importance of understanding myth not merely as an historical or cultural artifact but as a lived, experiential reality.

2. Lifeworld (Lebenswelt) and Mythology: Blumenberg's concept of lifeworld is closely tied to mythology, with the cave in Plato's Allegory of the Cave serving as an illustrative example. The lifeworld represents a pre-logical, taken-for-granted realm of reality. In Blumenberg's view, this lifeworld is not static but dynamic, characterized by escape and expulsion from one familiar world into another.

3. Escape-Expulsion: This motif of 'escape' or 'expulsion' symbolizes humanity's constant struggle to adapt to unfamiliar situations. Myths function as a response to this tension, offering consolation and orientation in exilic conditions. They are therapeutic and apotropaic devices that distance humans from overwhelming anxieties by naming the unnameable and controlling divine powers.

4. 'Zuendebringen' (Bringing to a close): Blumenberg introduces the term 'Zuendebringen,' which signifies both the reception of myth and its termination. This concept underscores that myths not only renew their significance but also bring closure to previous versions, thereby demythologizing them in a sense.

5. The Blumenbergian double message: Zuendebringen encapsulates two existential messages. Firstly, it invites rhetoric back into the lifeworld. Secondly, it prompts a reevaluation of Adorno's assertion that myths ultimately betray us by concealing deeper truths. Blumenberg argues for a post-Husserlian phenomenology that makes understandable the tension between fear (terror) and poetry in mythology.

6. Mythology as a human endeavor: Unlike other interpretations, Blumenberg's philosophy of mythology does not view it as an expression of dogmatic truths or primal fears. Instead, he sees myths as products of human creativity and secondary freedom—a freedom achieved through overcoming and sublating initial horrors via the rhetorical act of reception.

7. Myth's paradox: Blumenberg highlights a paradox inherent to mythology: while it aims to restore an illusory lifeworld, it simultaneously conceals and forgets its original meanings through the process of reception. This dynamic tension reflects Blumenberg's broader phenomenological interest in distantiation—a procedure of moving away from beginnings and engaging with transitions and receptions.

In summary, this passage explores Hans Blumenberg's unique philosophical perspective on mythology, which views it as a lived, dynamic experience intertwined with the lifeworld. By employing concepts like 'Zuendebringen' (bringing to a close), Blumenberg underscores how myths both perpetuate and subvert their original significance through an ongoing process of reception. This interpretation diverges from traditional views of myth as solely fear-based or poetic, instead emphasizing its role in human adaptation and consolation within a constantly shifting reality.


### 07-Experiencing timelessness and the phenomenology of temporal flow

The article by Paweł Gładziejewski titled "Experiencing timelessness and the phenomenology of temporal flow" explores the nature of the subjective experience of time passage, also known as the flow of time. The author argues that despite its seemingly self-evident presence in conscious experience, the precise phenomenology of temporal passage remains elusive and resistant to reductionist accounts.

Gładziejewski begins by discussing the reductive approach, which posits that temporal passage is a subset of intentional content within conscious perception, such as qualitative change, motion, succession, or duration. However, he argues that this strategy fails because it cannot accurately distinguish experiences with and without phenomenal time flow. For instance, experiences lacking specific types of content (e.g., discontinuous snapshots) may still involve a sense of temporal passage, and changes in how perception tracks object identities do not correspond to differences in temporal flow.

The author then introduces the concept of global states of consciousness (GSCs), which capture distinct phenomenal "profiles" that one's overall experience can take. These profiles are thought to be systematic shifts along various dimensions, such as attention and cognition, self, space, time, opacity/transparency, and range of intentional contents. By focusing on these global states, Gładziejewski suggests that we can find contrast cases to the ordinary experience of temporal flow by comparing experiences across different GSCs.

The main focus of the article is on altered GSCs associated with mystical experiences or pure consciousness states, which are often induced by long-term meditation practices or psychedelic compound use. These non-ordinary experiences are characterized by their radically different nature from everyday consciousness, including a diminished or complete disappearance of the subject-object structure and an experience of "centerless" unity.

One key aspect of mystical states is their timeless quality, where temporal passage feels suspended, outside of time, or transcending time. Despite the challenges in describing this phenomenon due to its elusive nature, Gładziejewski argues that existing intersubjectively accessible material from introspective reports and psychometric/neurophenomenological studies provides sufficient evidence for experiences of timelessness as plausible contrast cases to ordinary temporal flow.

The author stresses the importance of a charitable interpretation of these introspective reports, acknowledging potential issues such as memory inaccuracies or culturally biased interpretations while favoring a cautious approach until convincing skeptical arguments are presented. By examining altered GSCs and their impact on temporal experience, Gładziejewski aims to contribute to the ongoing debate about the nature of time's subjective phenomenology and potentially inform hypotheses regarding its source and underlying mechanisms.


The text discusses two types of timeless experiences—no-passage experiences and eternity experiences—and their implications for our understanding of temporal phenomenology and metaphysics.

1. No-passage Experiences: These are characterized by a halt in the subjective flow of time, where temporal passage comes to a standstill, and the dynamic, "flowy" quality is lost from consciousness. Subjects report a radically different experience from ordinary consciousness, which cannot be grasped from an everyday perspective. Despite this lack of temporal flow, some no-passage experiences also involve a sense of being 'in the present moment' or experiencing timeless change. The text proposes two interpretations for such paradoxical reports: (a) there is still some residual experience of temporal flow, even in no-passage states; or (b) individuals can perceive change without experiencing the passage of time, suggesting a double dissociation between the phenomenal character of temporal flow and perceptual representation of motion.

2. Eternity Experiences: These are characterized by an experiential sub specie aeternitatis outlook on reality, where one feels as though temporally disparate events are simultaneously co-existing outside of the passing time. Unlike no-passage experiences, eternity experiences lack any center point inside time from which reality is apprehended, meaning there's no unique 'now' moment privileged over past or future events. The text argues that while existing psychometric tools may not distinguish these experiences clearly, they can be differentiated intuitively and through anecdotal evidence.

3. Timeless Experiences and Non-believers in Subjective Passage: The text explores whether timeless experiences can convince subjects who deny the existence of subjective passage upon introspection that they overlooked something about their own experience. It proposes three scenarios: (a) recognizing a clear phenomenal contrast to ordinary experience regarding temporal flow; (b) significant individual differences in ordinary consciousness, with some people lacking an experience of temporal flow; or (c) acknowledging a difference but denying it relates to the absence of temporal flow. The text suggests that scenario (a) is the most likely, given subjective reports describing timeless experiences as radically different from ordinary temporal experience, with the key distinction being the lack of temporal passage.

4. Timeless Experiences and Metaphysical Beliefs about Objective Passage: The text discusses how timeless experiences can provide evidence for a view recognizing an all-encompassing experience of temporal flow. It argues that no-passage/eternity experiences, by offering phenomenal contrasts to ordinary temporal experiences, might convince skeptics about the existence of subjective passage in their own experience. The text also contends that timeless experiences reveal revisionary metaphysical views of time, such as B-theoretic or eternalist perspectives, which view reality as timeless or eternal rather than flowing.

5. Further Issues: Metaphysical Beliefs about Objective Passage and Hypotheses about Mechanisms of Phenomenal Passage:

   a. Timeless Experiences and Metaphysical Beliefs about the Passage of Time: The text questions whether ordinary experience is metaphysically loaded with respect to temporal flow, shaping commonsense metaphysical views of time as undergoing passage. It argues that no-passage/eternity experiences may lead people to consider or espouse alternative metaphysical views regarding temporal passage, such as B-theory or eternalism. This prediction is supported by subjective reports suggesting that mystical states reveal something about the nature of reality, including a timeless or eternal view in contrast to the flowing ordinary perspective.

   b. Developing Hypotheses about Flow Phenomenology: The text proposes a hypothesis regarding ordinary passage phenomenology based on Predictive Processing/Active Inference (PP/AI) frameworks. This hypothesis suggests that timeless experiences result from an acute disruption of the mechanism responsible for temporally synthesizing experience by integrating primal impressions, retentions, and protentions. In a mystical state induced by psychedelics or meditation, the generative model can no longer integrate incoming information to form a diachronically coherent stream, resulting in subjective time standing still (no-passage experiences) or temporally static representations of events (eternity experiences). This hypothesis implies that existing Brentanian-Husserlian models, when interpreted through the lens of PP/AI, can explain aspects of temporal phenomenology.


Title: The Phenomenal Flow of Time and Its Relation to Consciousness

The article, authored by Paweł Gładziejewski, delves into the subjective experience of time's passage and its relation to consciousness. The author argues that the feeling of temporal flow is an integral part of everyday conscious experience, often overlooked due to its elusive nature.

1. **The Elusiveness of Temporal Flow**: Despite its ubiquity in our conscious lives, the subjective sense of time's passage has been disputed or denied by some philosophers and scientists. The paper seeks to provide a novel approach to understanding this phenomenon.

2. **Radical Alterations of Temporal Experience**: Gładziejewski explores radically altered states of consciousness where the subjective flow of time is suspended, leading to experiences described as "outside of time." These states serve as phenomenal contrast cases to illuminate the nature of ordinary temporal experience.

3. **Temporal Flow as a Phenomenal Modifier**: The author argues that the feeling of temporal flow should not be reduced to specific intentional content but rather understood as a formal principle binding diverse contents together in a coherent manner. This perspective aligns with Hoerl's (2023) "rationalist" stance on subjective flow, suggesting it is an implicit aspect of how our brains construct the world.

4. **Model-Disruption Accounts**: The paper connects this view to model-disruption accounts of mediative and psychedelic states, which attenuate multiple high-level cognitive priors simultaneously. This unified explanation also accounts for experiences of timelessness observed in these altered states of consciousness.

5. **Connection with the Sense of Self**: The article further proposes a link between the subjective flow of time and the sense of self, suggesting that both might stem from similar integrative cognitive processes. This connection could explain why experiences of timelessness often co-occur with acute changes to one's sense of self or identity during meditation or under psychedelics.

6. **Challenges and Open Questions**: The author acknowledges challenges, such as potential contradictions between no-passage and eternity experiences resulting from the same cognitive mechanism disruption. These complexities point to areas for future research.

7. **Implications and Future Directions**: Gładziejewski's approach may offer insights into understanding ordinary temporal phenomenology, its underlying information processing mechanisms, and its relation to commonsense beliefs about objective time. It also suggests limitations in contrasting methodologies based on drawing phenomenal distinctions across different global states of consciousness due to the tight entanglement between the sense of self and temporal flow.

In summary, this paper presents a novel perspective on the subjective experience of time's passage within consciousness. By examining radically altered states where temporal flow is suspended, it proposes that our ordinary sense of time is a product of internal cognitive mechanisms, challenging reductionist accounts and offering new avenues for understanding this fundamental aspect of human experience.


### 07-Theory_ practice and performance

Title: Theory, Practice, and Performance - An Embodied Cognition Perspective

Author: Shaun Gallagher

Journal: Connection Science (2017)

Summary:

Shaun Gallagher's paper explores the relevance of embodied cognition (EC) to expert performance, specifically in the context of performing arts like music and dance. He delves into key concepts within EC, including body schema, affectivity, distributed cognition, and intersubjectivity, and discusses their implications for understanding performance.

1. Embodied Cognition (EC): Gallagher starts by explaining the shift from traditional mind-body dualism to the embodied mind approach in the 1990s, which posits that cognition is deeply rooted in the body and environment. He highlights that EC challenges internalist views of cognition as solely brain-based.

2. Body Schema: The author explains Merleau-Ponty's notion of body schema – a system of sensory-motor processes governing posture and motor control without conscious monitoring. As expertise develops, the body schema takes over, allowing for automatic movement and freeing up attention for other aspects of performance. This process is affected by cultural, social factors, and can include tools or instruments in the extended body schema.

3. Distributed Cognition and Extended Mind: Gallagher discusses how some EC views consider cognitive mechanisms to extend beyond the brain into the environment (tools, technologies). The "extended mind" hypothesis suggests that external devices or aspects of the environment can be part of the cognitive system. This idea draws from pragmatist thinkers like John Dewey and highlights the functional role of these tools in thinking and problem-solving.

4. Enactivism: Unlike extended mind proponents, enactivists reject internal representations entirely. They emphasize that perception is action-oriented (pragmatic) and best explained through body-relative affordances – the ways the environment presents possibilities for action based on our abilities and skills. Enactivism also highlights intersubjectivity as crucial to understanding cognition, arguing that interactions with others shape our perception, behavior, and judgement.

5. EC and Expert Practice: Gallagher discusses how EC theories can help define expertise and inform performance studies in music and dance. He critiques Dreyfus' notion of mindlessness in expert performance, suggesting that reflection and thought are still integral to skilled actions.

6. Artistic Performance: The author examines research on musical performance, arguing against the idea that high performers enter a mindless state. Instead, he proposes a range of conscious states during performance, including focus on details, thoughts about social interactions, and immersion in the music itself. Gallagher suggests that these experiences involve the interplay of body schema, affect, music, and other players, all contributing to the performer's intentionality and skilled action.

In conclusion, Gallagher argues for a holistic view of embodied performance, where various factors like body schema, emotion, music, and social interactions work together dynamically in a performative context. EC theory can provide valuable insights into understanding these complex interrelationships while also benefiting from empirical studies that refine our knowledge of the phenomenology of expert performance.


The provided text is a list of references on cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience related to embodied cognition, expertise, skill acquisition, body schema, and intersubjectivity. Here's a detailed summary and explanation of the key themes:

1. Embodied Cognition: This approach emphasizes that mental processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the environment. It suggests that cognition is not merely a product of the brain but extends to include aspects like perception, action, and even social interaction. Key authors include H. Dreyfus, V. Gallese, S. Gallagher, and A. Merleau-Ponty.

2. Expertise and Skill Acquisition: Several papers explore how expertise develops through extensive practice, focusing on motor skills, attentional focus, and proceduralization. Notable works include Ford et al. (2005), Dreyfus & Dreyfus (1980), and Pereira et al. (2013).

3. Body Schema: The concept of body schema refers to an individual's subjective experience of their body in space, including its movements, position, and boundaries. Gallagher (2005b) and Maravita & Iriki (2004) discuss body schema, while Montero (2016) examines how dance training affects aesthetic judgement from an embodied cognition perspective.

4. Intersubjectivity: This concept refers to the shared understanding between individuals regarding their mutual experiences and perspectives. Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception (2012) and Gallagher & Meltzoff (1996) explore intersubjectivity, particularly in relation to early developmental studies.

5. Embodied Simulation: This theory proposes that understanding others' actions involves simulating those actions within one's own body representation or mental model. Sebanz et al. (2003), Gibson (1977), and Soliman & Glenberg (2014) discuss embodied simulation in cognition, perception, and action.

6. Merleau-Pontian Legacy: Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology has influenced various fields, including feminist theory, critical race studies, and disability studies, as seen in Weiss (2015). His work on embodied experience highlights the importance of considering bodily interactions with the environment.

7. Cognitive Science & Philosophy: The texts cover a range of interdisciplinary approaches to understanding cognition, from Damasio's Descartes Error (1994) exploring emotion and reason in the brain to Hayes et al.'s self-produced and observed actions influencing emotions (2008).

8. Judicial Decisions & Cognitive Biases: Danziger, Levav, & Avnaim-Pesso's (2011) research on extraneous factors in judicial decisions sheds light on cognitive biases influencing decision-making processes.

9. Philosophical Logic: Dewey's Essays in Experimental Logic (1916) contributes to philosophical logic, focusing on the relationship between inquiry and problem-solving.

Overall, these references illustrate a wide-ranging exploration of embodied cognition, expertise development, intersubjectivity, and their related themes, highlighting the importance of understanding human cognition through an interdisciplinary lens.


### 08-Motivating Transcendental Phenomenology_ Husserl_s Critique of Kant

In his essay "Motivating Transcendental Phenomenology: Husserl's Critique of Kant," Gregory Scott Moss discusses how Edmund Husserl's critique of Immanuel Kant's transcendental logic serves as a guiding principle to understand central tenets of Husserl's phenomenology of reason.

1. **Husserl's Critique of Kant's Transcendental Logic** (Section I):
   - Moss outlines Husserl's argument that Kant is guilty of psychologism, committing the fallacy of reducing mental processes to physiological or psychological states.
   - Kant's transcendental logic, according to Husserl, fails because it relies on formal logic as a condition for the possibility of experience. This conflates the conditions and consequences of experience, leading to an incomplete understanding of logical structures.

2. **The Notion of Ideal Objectivity** (Section II):
   - Moss explicates Husserl's notion of ideal objectivity as a way to escape Kant's psychologism.
   - For Husserl, categories and formal logic must be recognized as objects of experience themselves, which he terms "ideal objects." This shift allows for a transcendental inquiry into the conditions for their possibility.

3. **Husserl's Account of Constitution of Ideal Objects** (Section III):
   - Moss presents Husserl's phenomenological method, which focuses on transcendental conditions for consciousness of objects rather than metaphysical debates about their existence.
   - By bracketing the natural attitude and applying epoché to logical cognition, one discovers that formal logic treats its constituents as independent self-identical objects (evident judgments), revealing a form of intentionality inherent in logical practice.

4. **The Transcendental Conditions for the Constitution of Ideal Objects** (Section IV):
   - Moss explores specific conditions for the possibility of ideal objects, focusing on Husserl's critique of Kant to illustrate necessary modifications in transcendental logic.
   - Central among these is the concept of "evident judgments" or "pre-predicative judgments," whereby individual determinate objects serve as evidence for universal concepts. This allows for formalization and categorial intuition, which underpin logical reasoning.

Husserl's critique of Kant serves to motivate his transcendental phenomenology by revealing the inadequacies of Kant's approach, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive understanding of logical structures as objects of experience. This perspective enables Husserl to develop his concept of ideal objectivity and rethink traditional notions like truth and evidence within the framework of transcendental phenomenology.


The text presented is a philosophical analysis comparing Immanuel Kant's views on logic and judgment with those of Edmund Husserl, particularly focusing on Husserl's critique of Kant as found in his work "Formal and Transcendental Logic." Here are the key points:

1. **Kant's View**: For Kant, logic is formal (dealing with rules of thought) but not transcendental (not concerned with the nature of objects). Truth is defined as correspondence between a concept and its object. Evidence in Kant is absolute security against deception, rooted in predication.

2. **Husserl's Critique**: Husserl criticizes Kant for psychologism (treating logical principles as empirical or psychological laws). He argues that for Kant, logic lacks a genuine grounding in the nature of objects and experiences.

3. **Husserl's Approach**: Husserl proposes a phenomenological approach to logic, where logical principles are based on the intentional structure of consciousness (intentionality). He introduces the concept of 'evidence' as a determinate evidential base, which is rooted in the original disclosure of objects in intentional having.

4. **Ideal Objects**: Husserl introduces ideal objects that are not material or empirical but rather universals that can be the content of thought and experience. These ideal objects are grounded in a determinate evidential base, which consists of conceptual individuals. 

5. **Truth Logic vs Formal Logic**: Unlike Kant's formal logic, Husserl's 'truth logic' is not indifferent to its content. It investigates the proper relations between concepts as dictated by their inherent meaning or intuition (evidential base). This leads to an intensional logic where the meaning of judgments is derived from this evidential base.

6. **Judgment and Predication**: Husserl alters the relationship between judgment and objects, arguing that truth involves the original disclosure of objects in intentional having, rather than mere correspondence to objects. This shift changes the meaning of 'evidence' from absolute security against deception to 'functioning intentionality.'

7. **Phenomenological Critique**: Husserl's phenomenological critique of Kant provides a framework for understanding his own phenomenology of reason, including concepts like ideal objects, evidence, and the nature of logical principles. 

In essence, Husserl's critique of Kant aims to establish logic on a foundation that respects the intentional structure of consciousness, leading to a richer, more nuanced understanding of judgment, truth, and evidence. This contrasts sharply with Kant's more formalistic approach, which Husserl argues lacks a genuine grounding in the nature of objects and experiences.


### 08-Physiology and phenomenology of tinnitus_ Implications for treatment

Title: Physiology and phenomenology of tinnitus: Implications for treatment

Authors: William Noble and Richard Tyler

Journal: International Journal of Audiology (2007)

This paper discusses the physiological and psychological aspects of tinnitus, focusing on its implications for treatment. The authors argue that a better understanding of both dimensions is crucial in effectively managing tinnitus distress. They present three main sections:

1. Physiology of Tinnitus:
   The authors propose a cortical model of tinnitus, emphasizing disinhibition and cortical remapping following injury at the receptor level as primary mechanisms. This perspective is supported by human and animal experimental findings, including studies demonstrating changes in cochlear output, increased spontaneous neural activity, reduced lateral inhibition, and cortical remapping. They also draw an analogy between tinnitus and 'phantom limb pain,' suggesting that both phenomena result from disrupted sensory input and subsequent reorganization of the affected brain areas.

2. Tinnitus as a Phenomenon:
   The paper highlights the distinction between hearing impairment and tinnitus, arguing that while hearing loss is often characterized by partial control and shared blame, tinnitus can lead to major loss of control and self-blame. Tinnitus' primary effect is not disrupting social connections but threatening the individual's sense of life and sanity due to its unwanted nature and potential perception as a sign of serious illness.

3. Implications for Treatment:
   Noble and Tyler suggest that the phenomenology of tinnitus – its subjective experience for the person sustaining it – is critical in treatment. They argue against an animal model of conditioning, which posits tinnitus as a neutral stimulus leading to distress due to association with other stressful events. Instead, they emphasize that tinnitus can be intrinsically stressful for some people, requiring clinical psychology concepts and treatment approaches.

   The authors propose a flexible collaboration between clinical audiologists and clinical psychologists as the most effective strategy for tinnitus management. This multidisciplinary approach would account for both the physiological basis of tinnitus and its subjective, stressful nature, ultimately enhancing overall treatment outcomes.

In conclusion, this paper underscores the importance of understanding tinnitus not only as a physiological phenomenon but also from the perspective of those experiencing it. Recognizing tinnitus' potential for causing significant psychological distress and its unique subjective nature paves the way for more comprehensive treatment strategies, combining both audiological and psychological interventions.


The text discusses the challenges in treating tinnitus, a persistent ringing or buzzing sound in the ears, and proposes a more comprehensive approach to managing this condition. The authors highlight several key issues with current treatment methods:

1. **Unrealistic Expectations**: Many patients expect their tinnitus to disappear completely, which is often not the case. This unmet expectation can lead to frustration and increased distress.

2. **Inadequate Treatments**: Current treatments like counseling, sound therapy, and wearable sound generators do not eliminate tinnitus. While they may help patients adapt or accept their condition, they do not cure it.

3. **Use of 'Phantom' Terminology**: The use of terms like "phantom auditory sensation" or "hallucination" can be counterproductive. These terms imply that tinnitus is imagined rather than a real, physiological phenomenon. This can undermine the patient's perception of the condition and hinder effective treatment.

The authors suggest an alternative approach based on a deeper understanding of patients' thoughts and emotions, especially for those with severe distress. They propose distinguishing three broad patient groups: the curious, the concerned, and the distressed. 

- **Curious**: These individuals may be reassured and provided with information about tinnitus, which could help them accept and adapt to their condition.
  
- **Concerned**: For those who continue to worry or be worried, more extensive counseling programs, like Tinnitus Activities Therapy (TAT), might be beneficial. TAT aims to reintegrate the patient into their daily life by encouraging them to participate in activities they've avoided due to tinnitus.

- **Distressed**: For patients who remain significantly distressed despite these interventions, referral to mental health professionals with expertise in managing emotional and personal disturbances is advised. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown promise in reducing tinnitus-related distress, annoyance, and intrusiveness.

The authors also propose a collaborative model between audiologists and clinical psychologists to better address tinnitus. Audiologists, with their expertise in assessment, diagnosis, and general rehabilitation, can work alongside psychologists who specialize in managing emotional responses to chronic conditions like tinnitus. This collaboration could lead to more holistic care for patients, combining the best of both disciplines - physical/biological science-based interventions with psychosocial and coping strategies.

In conclusion, effective tinnitus treatment requires a multifaceted approach that acknowledges not only its physiological underpinnings but also the significant emotional impact it can have on individuals' lives. By recognizing this complexity and fostering collaboration between different healthcare professionals, we can strive to provide more effective, patient-centered care for those suffering from tinnitus.


### 08-Space perception_ movement_ and insight_ attuning to the space of everyday life after major we

Title: Space Perception, Movement, and Insight: Attuning to the Space of Everyday Life After Major Weight Loss

Authors: Eli Natvik, Karen Synne Groven, Målfrid Råheim, Eva Gjengedal, and Shaun Gallagher

Journal: Physiotherapy Theory and Practice (2019)

Summary:

This article explores the phenomenological aspects of space perception, movement, and insight experienced by individuals after undergoing major weight loss, particularly focusing on the physiotherapeutic implications. The authors use the concepts of body image, body schema, and affordances to delve into how people adjust their spatial understanding and interaction with the environment following significant changes in body size.

1. Body Image: This refers to one's psychological experience of the appearance and functioning of one's body. Negative body image may persist after successful weight loss, causing distress and ongoing dissatisfaction with body weight and appearance.

2. Body Schema: It involves the unconscious sensory-motor capacities that enable us to navigate and interact with our environment without explicit awareness or perceptual monitoring. Following major weight loss, the central nervous system may lag in updating this schema, leading to a disconnect between one's actual body size and their movement patterns.

3. Affordances: These are the possibilities for action that an individual perceives within the environment, which depend on both the person's bodily capacities and the features of the environment itself. Alterations in body size can impact how individuals perceive available affordances.

The authors use a real-life example (Carl) of a nautical engineer who underwent bariatric surgery, resulting in over 100 kg weight loss. Carl experienced challenges adjusting to his new body size while navigating the cramped engine room on the ship where he worked. Initially, his old habits and spatial awareness were still tied to his larger body size, causing difficulties and frustrations in adapting to his new capabilities.

Through exploration and experimentation within his work environment, Carl gradually realized that the restrictions he once had due to his large body size no longer existed. His new body size enabled him to access spaces and perform tasks previously unavailable. This realization led to a re-evaluation of his professional practice as he adapted to the changes in affordances within his working environment.

In conclusion, major weight loss can open up new possibilities for being in the world, but only after adjustments in body image and body schema. The authors suggest that physiotherapists can use these insights to better understand and support patients undergoing significant weight changes, helping them navigate their evolving spatial experiences and facilitate smoother transitions into their new, smaller bodies.


The text discusses the case of a man named Carl, who underwent bariatric surgery leading to significant weight loss. This transformation impacted his body schema (the unconscious knowledge of one's body and its capabilities) and body image (one's mental representation of their physical self). 

Before the surgery, Carl had developed specific habits and work styles due to his larger body, which he didn't incorporate into the engine room where he worked. Despite his expertise, he avoided entering this tight space because it was not adapted to his body schema. His colleagues' bodies became extensions of his as they facilitated interactions with the engine room on his behalf.

Post-surgery, Carl found himself in a situation where his new, smaller body could fit into spaces previously inaccessible. However, his body schema and body image lagged behind this physical reality. He experienced confusion and had to consciously explore the engine room's new affordances to integrate them into his body schema. This process involved reconciling his previous understanding of his body size with his current, altered physical capabilities.

The text also highlights the interplay between body image and body schema. Body image shapes our mental perception of ourselves, while body schema governs our automatic interaction with the environment based on our bodily abilities. When there's a mismatch between these two (as in Carl's case), it can lead to difficulties in navigating spaces and performing tasks appropriately.

The authors draw on phenomenology, a philosophical approach focusing on experiences from the first-person perspective, to analyze Carl's situation. They argue that major weight loss necessitates adjustments not just in body image (our conscious perception of our physical self) but also in body schema (unconscious bodily knowledge).

For physiotherapists working with patients who have experienced substantial weight loss, this case study underscores the importance of understanding these psychological and physical changes. It suggests that simply promoting lifestyle changes or physical activity might not be enough; a more holistic approach is needed. This includes addressing the patient's altered body image and schema through movement exploration, open dialogue about their experiences, and tailored exercises focusing on body awareness, boundaries, strengths, and limitations.

In essence, the text emphasizes that bariatric surgery and subsequent weight loss are not just physical transformations but also involve complex psychological adjustments. It underscores the value of a patient-centered, phenomenologically informed approach in physiotherapy to support individuals like Carl in navigating their altered bodies and environments effectively.


### 08-The role of constraints on descriptions in phenomenology

In the paper "The role of constraints on descriptions in phenomenology," George Berguno discusses the significance of descriptions in phenomenological psychology, challenging three common assumptions about them: their marginality to professional activities, unreliability as foundational material for science, and inferiority to explanations.

Berguno introduces the concept of "constraints on descriptions" as a crucial element in developing phenomenological psychology. He argues that phenomenologists should study naïve descriptions of experiences within clinical settings, as they have much to gain from this approach. 

The author presents three key ideas of phenomenology: 
1. Phenomenology is the study of experiences with an aim to uncover their essences or underlying reasons.
2. It purports to be a presuppositionless method of philosophical analysis.
3. Phenomenology seeks what is prior to knowledge, making it the most fundamental discipline.

To illustrate phenomenological practice, Berguno uses Husserl's epoché (bracketing) and the method of desisting from constructing explanations and engaging in describing experiences instead. He acknowledges the difficulty in carrying out this step due to the assumption that explanations are more valuable than descriptions.

Berguno then discusses how descriptions have been considered unreliable for foundational scientific work, leading psychologists to focus on data collection methods and classification techniques borrowed from other disciplines like Grounded Theory Research. However, he argues that descriptions remain essential for explanations in both natural and social sciences.

To highlight the utility of naïve descriptions, Berguno references Amedeo Giorgi's empirical phenomenological method (1985), which involves determining what an experience means to the person who has undergone it by listening to their full description and uncovering meaning units within the narrative.

Berguno then proposes two new ideas: 
1. While methods like Giorgi's are valuable, there are alternative routes for phenomenological psychology.
2. Psychotherapists and counsellors can benefit from examining their practice of working with descriptions of experiences, which could lead to insights into clients' situations.

The author suggests that it is not the search for explanations but the act of describing and redescribing our experiences that leads to insight. To illustrate this point, Berguno provides examples from cognitive science and psychotherapy: 
- In cognitive science, bracketing assumptions about mental representations and computer models reveals the limitations in explaining everyday experiences of mind.
- In psychotherapy, introducing constraints on descriptions (e.g., describing all dream phenomena as aspects to which one is attuned) can lead clients to new insights regarding their situations.

Berguno concludes that the idea of constraints on descriptions has implications for both philosophy and clinical practice, challenging the traditional subject-object dichotomy and encouraging reflection on assumptions in our descriptions of lived experiences. He also raises intriguing questions about reconciling different phenomenological perspectives, emphasizing that settling disputes involves uncovering underlying assumptions and agreeing not to reintroduce them into new descriptions.


### 08-When Poetry and Phenomenology Collide

In this article, Jeremy Page explores the intersection between poetry and phenomenology, specifically focusing on Martin Heidegger's early ontological divisions presented in Being and Time (1927) and their application to Frank O'Hara's poetic works.

Heidegger's Being and Time introduces three modes of being: substances, equipment, and Dasein (human existence). Substances are self-sufficient entities within the world, while equipment refers to objects in use or not in use (present-at-hand or ready-to-hand). Ready-to-hand equipment withdraws from conscious perception as one skillfully engages with it. Dasein is the unique human mode of being characterized by our purposive use of equipment within the world.

Page argues that Heidegger's ontological divisions are insufficient in accounting for poetic thought, particularly when poetry examines and represents the physical world. To address this issue, he introduces the term "environment-at-hand" to describe the relationship between artists and their surrounding environments used for creating artwork.

The author analyzes three Frank O'Hara poems to demonstrate how they challenge Heidegger's notion of equipment withdrawal:

1. Interior (With Jane): This poem blurs the distinction between subject and object, as objects are described as eagerly willing to be motives for action—something that the human subjects are afraid to do. The reification of subject/object relations is compounded through rhetorical questions and syntactic ambiguity.

2. Walking to Work: This poem explores the tension between happiness and fear, immobility and motion as O'Hara navigates New York City's streets. The environment-at-hand functions as both a literal setting and a source of sociopolitical commentary on inclusion and exclusion.

Page highlights how these poems demonstrate an engaged mode of being-in-the-world that transcends the subject/object dichotomy, showcasing the interrelation between Dasein and the physical world. In doing so, they reveal the insufficiency of Heidegger's early phenomenological ontology in accounting for poetic thought.

To reconcile these findings with Heideggerian phenomenology, Page proposes the concept of "environment-at-hand," which captures the unique possibility of being-in-the-world where the physical environment acts as artistic inspiration without withdrawing from conscious perception. This mode of being reverses the usual way in which we encounter ready-to-hand equipment, bringing latent properties and emotional resonance to the fore.

By examining O'Hara's poetry through Heidegger's lens and introducing the concept of environment-at-hand, Page argues that poetry not only reveals new ways of looking at the world but also aids in understanding the nature of being itself, enriching both phenomenology and poetic analysis.


The article discusses how philosopher Martin Heidegger's concepts can be applied to understand Frank O'Hara's poetry, particularly focusing on the themes of engagement with the environment and the nature of art. The author uses Heidegger's phenomenology, specifically his distinctions between 'Being', 'equipment', and 'Dasein', to analyze O'Hara's work.

In "Walking to Work," the author argues that O'Hara employs the urban environment as an 'environment-at-hand,' breaking down the subject/object divide and foregrounding the interrelationship between human existence (Dasein) and its world. The poem, in which O'Hara crosses against a traffic light to get to work at MoMA, is seen as a performative act flouting societal norms, symbolizing a departure from heteronormative expectations while arriving at his professional and self-expressive goals.

The author suggests that Heidegger's phenomenology can help correct the limitations of traditional subject/object views in understanding this interaction between human existence (Dasein) and its world. By using affordances embedded in the external environment, O'Hara utilizes the 'environment-at-hand' as a means to establish his identity as both poet and individual with unique sexual preferences.

The author further explores how O'Hara employs specific elements of the urban landscape – streets, traffic lights, and darkness – philosophically to challenge conventional norms and express personal identity. For instance, the traffic light is not just an object with properties that can withdraw but also an 'equipment ready-to-hand' that O'Hara brings to the fore as a metaphor for artistic creation.

The author also highlights O'Hara's "Heroic Sculpture," where he references Auguste Rodin's sculpture, The Thinker. This poem is interpreted as an exploration of the connection between human creativity and animal instinct, suggesting that humans find their most defining acts not in base bodily functions but through artistic creation—staring into 'the light' to think.

The article concludes by discussing the relationship between poetry and Heidegger's thought, proposing that poetry, as a form of philosophical inquiry, can reveal essential truths about human existence. Through a dialectical definition of the poem – both text and experiential event – it is suggested that poems resist fixed interpretations and expand over time, reflecting their language-character and infinite possibilities for meaning.

The author also addresses criticisms of applying Heidegger to O'Hara's work, acknowledging the philosopher's evolving thought on technology and art. Ultimately, the article posits that Heideggerian phenomenology can offer a nuanced understanding of poetic thought and its capacity to unveil fundamental truths about human existence and our engagement with the world.


### 09-Cognitive and neural components of the phenomenology of agency

Title: Cognitive and Neural Components of the Phenomenology of Agency

Authors: Ezequiel Morsella, Christopher C. Berger, and Stephen C. Krieger

Journal: Neurocase (Volume 17, Issue 3, Pages 209-230, 2011)

Summary:

This research paper explores the cognitive and neural underpinnings of the sense of agency—the feeling that one is causing an action. The authors argue for a reductionistic approach to understanding this complex phenomenon by focusing on low-level component processes, without relying on high-level conceptual or 'central executive' processes.

The paper begins by discussing the high-level components of agency, which are based on the perception of lawful correspondence between action intentions and outcomes. These components involve a high-level conceptual process that takes into account contextual factors such as motor efference, proprioception, and real-world consequences. Experimental evidence shows that manipulating these factors can lead subjects to believe they caused actions that were actually caused by something else (e.g., mismatched intentions and outcomes).

The authors then shift their focus to low-level components of agency, which include basic consciousness and subjective urges. They propose that the sense of agency is associated with an inclination or urge accompanied by basic consciousness. Examples given are holding one's breath or refraining from dropping a hot dish, where both the urge to act (or not act) and the conscious experience of intending co-occur.

The authors justify their reductionistic approach, arguing against the necessity of a 'supervisory system' or homuncular agent in the brain for agency. Instead, they propose that agency can be explained by appealing to low-level processes and ideomotor theory, which suggests that mere thoughts of actions produce impulses that, without suppression, result in the performance of those imagined actions.

In Supramodular Interaction Theory (SIT), representations competing for action selection are considered the primary cause of conscious conflicts—a key feature of low-level agency components. Such conflicts include holding one's breath underwater or suppressing emotions, where conflicting plans necessitate consciousness to integrate incompatible skeletomotor intentions.

The paper concludes by discussing the neural basis of these basic components. According to SIT, unconscious representations alone cannot generate 'voluntary' (integrated) actions; they must be conscious. The authors propose that efference-efference binding—the interaction between two streams of motor planning—is associated with consciousness and is critical for agency.

In summary, this paper presents a novel perspective on the sense of agency by focusing on low-level cognitive and neural processes, such as inter-representational dynamics and basic consciousness. The authors propose that these components are essential to understanding how we experience ourselves as agents in the world.


Table 1 presents a summary of various experimental tasks designed to investigate efference-efference binding, a process central to understanding agency and consciousness. Here's an explanation of each task:

1. **Stroop Task (Stroop, 1935)**
   - In this classic task, participants are asked to name the color of ink in which words are printed. The words often conflict with the ink color (e.g., "RED" written in blue), leading to response interference and increased urges to make mistakes. This task is used to study efference-efference binding as it involves competition between word reading and color naming plans.

2. **MacLeod & Dunbar Shape and Color Naming Task (MacLeod & MacDonald, 2000)**
   - Participants are trained to name nonsense shapes using color names. In the incongruent condition, shape and color name differ (e.g., naming a blue shape as 'orange'), leading to interference and increased urges. This task is "purer" than the Stroop task because it involves the same kind of action (naming) for both task-relevant and irrelevant stimuli.

3. **Flanker Task (Eriksen & Schultz, 1979; Coles et al., 1985)**
   - In this task, participants are instructed to respond to a central target while ignoring flanking distracters. Interference occurs when the flankers and target differ in response (response interference) or appearance but share the same response (perceptual interference). The flanker task is used to study efference-efference binding by examining how automatic activation of response codes by distracters affects performance and subjective experiences.

4. **Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT; Bush et al., 2003)**
   - This advanced interference task involves indicating an oddball stimulus in a set of three. Interference arises when participants must press one button to indicate the oddball, which may conflict with other response tendencies or perceptual interpretations. The MSIT is used to study complex forms of efference-efference binding and their effects on subjective experiences and performance.

5. **Antisaccade Task (Curtis & D'Esposito, 2009; Hallett, 1978)**
   - In this task, participants are instructed to look away from a salient stimulus (e.g., a bright light or loud sound). Performance is easier and faster in the congruent condition, where participants look towards the stimulus. The antisaccade task is used to study efference-efference binding by examining how suppressing prepotent action plans affects subjective experiences and performance.

6. **Sustained Intentions Task (Morsella et al., 2009a)**
   - This task was designed to isolate the subjective effects of efference-efference binding by activating incompatible intentions without behavioral performance. Participants are asked to hold in mind incompatible, congruent, and compatible intentions while introspecting their experiences. The sustained intentions task is used to study how holding incompatible plans affects subjective experiences without the influence of response conflict or other confounds.

Each of these tasks aims to manipulate and measure efference-efference binding by creating situations where conflicting action plans lead to increased cognitive load, errors, and subjective urges. These tasks have contributed significantly to our understanding of agency and consciousness by revealing the neural mechanisms underlying the experience of inner conflict and self-control.


The text discusses a meta-analysis of research examining the perception of 'something countering the will of the self' across various experimental conditions, focusing on tasks involving efference-efference binding (conflict) versus congruent conditions (no conflict). The analysis pooled data from different studies, categorizing them into two main groups: 'perception of something countering the will of the self' and 'perceptions of self-control'.

1. **Perception of Something Countering the Will of the Self**

   - **Effect Sizes (ddiff1 & ddiff2):** The mean weighted effect size for comparing conflict (efference-efference binding) to congruent (no conflict) conditions was 1.18 (95% CI = 1.08 - 1.27; Z = 24.58). When comparing conflict to regular efference binding with minimal perceptual interference, the mean weighted effect size was .90 (95% CI = .79 - 1.01; Z = 16.03).

   - **Key Findings:**
     - Efference-efference binding reliably produced stronger subjective perturbations across various tasks, indicating that conflicting action plans are perceived as foreign to the self.
     - These effects were found regardless of whether effectors (body parts used for actions) were involved, if participants were motionless, or if stimuli were held in working memory.
     - Even with subliminal (masked) stimuli, similar subjective effects were observed, suggesting that these effects are not solely due to conflict at the level of action initiation but may also involve higher-level cognitive processes.

2. **Perceptions of Self-Control**

   - **Effect Sizes (ddiff1 & ddiff2):** The mean weighted effect size for comparing conflict to congruent conditions was -.54 (95% CI = -0.36 - -0.73; Z = 5.69). When comparing conflict to regular efference binding with minimal perceptual interference, the mean weighted effect size was -.57 (95% CI = -0.38 - -0.76; Z = 5.90).

   - **Key Findings:**
     - Lower 'perceptions of self-control' were observed in conflict conditions compared to congruent ones, suggesting that harmony or congruence between cognitive processes is associated with higher perceived self-control.

The research suggests that efference-efference binding (conflict) results in stronger subjective experiences of something countering the will of the self, while congruent conditions (no conflict) are associated with increased perceptions of self-control. These findings support the theory that basic consciousness and low-level processes involved in conflicts play a crucial role in our experience of agency. The study also highlights the distinction between perceptual-like representations (consciously experienced) and motor-like processes (unconscious), which are relevant to action selection and working memory.


The text discusses the concept of "agency" - the sense of controlling one's actions and experiences - and its underlying neuroanatomy. The authors emphasize that a comprehensive theory of agency should identify the minimal neural structure capable of generating a basic conscious state, including urges or intentions.

The controversy surrounding the primacy of cortical versus subcortical structures in constituting consciousness is highlighted. While some researchers propose that consciousness can arise from a unique set of cells within specific brain regions, others argue for large-scale synchronization across the brain. Despite disagreement, there is consensus that basic consciousness involves processes along the ventral thalamocortical stream.

The authors further explore the neural correlates of agency and urges. They discuss the role of interference tasks in examining efference-efference binding (EEB), a phenomenon linked to the sense of agency. In minimal interference tasks, brain activations uniquely associated with EEB and subjective conflict were found in regions related to working memory, which is closely tied to conscious action selection.

The authors also delve into neurological conditions that shed light on agency, such as alien hand syndrome, anarchic hand syndrome, and utilization behavior syndrome. These disorders involve autonomous hand functions performing goal-directed behaviors maladaptively, often in contrast to the patients' reported intentions. Such phenomena are proposed to result from a lack of cross-talk among actional systems rather than impaired supervisory processes alone.

The authors suggest that subjective measures like urges can reveal which representations are absent or weak during pathological decision-making processes, potentially offering more insight into cognitive processing than behavioral or psychophysiological measures. For instance, they reference a study where the size of the subjective effect in an interference task was larger than the behavioral RT effect, indicating that urges could reveal aspects of processing not detectable through less subtle behavioral measures.

The text also touches upon the idea that consciousness might not be simply the activation of a network of specific neuroanatomical loci but rather a mode of interaction among these regions. Interregional synchrony is suggested as playing an essential role in determining cognitive and behavioral outcomes, with reentrant processing sustained by top-down signals being crucial for consciousness.

The authors propose that the sense of agency could result from conflict detection systems (comparator models), involving repetitive cycles of mismatch detection. They also acknowledge the lack of a comprehensive theory explaining why the contents of consciousness require "phenomenality" to be communicated or shared, suggesting this question might necessitate a fundamental reconceptualization of our understanding of cognition's physical basis.

The text concludes by noting that, despite ongoing debates and unanswered questions about the basic neural components of agency, research in this area has made strides in reducing complex phenomena to fundamental mechanisms before identifying their neural underpinnings, similar to recent approaches in cognitive science.

### 09-Group-based_ individualized exercises can provide perceived bodily changes and strengthen aspe

This study, titled "Group-based, individualized exercises can provide perceived bodily changes and strengthen aspects of self in individuals with MS: a qualitative interview study," was published in the journal Physiotherapy Theory and Practice. The research aimed to explore the experiences of individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) participating in a 6-week, group-based, individualized physiotherapy intervention called GroupCoreDIST.

The study employed a qualitative design using in-depth interviews within a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Thirteen participants were selected from the GroupCoreDIST group based on specific criteria such as age, gender, EDSS values, and time since diagnosis for a strategic sample. The participants were interviewed twice – at week 7 and week 30 after starting the intervention.

The GroupCoreDIST intervention emphasizes multifaceted aspects of balance, including coordinated interplay between proximal and distal parts of the body (core), individualization, insights, stability, specificity, somatosensory activation, and training. The program consists of an initial individual clinical examination by a physiotherapist, followed by group sessions with three participants for pragmatic reasons, each lasting 60 minutes, three times per week for six weeks.

The interviews explored the participants' experiences and reflections regarding the assessment, exercises, group setting, tailoring, impairments, and potential changes within the body and daily activities. The second interview focused on retrospective reflections and the impact of the intervention on their daily lives after completion.

Using systematic text condensation with dynamic systems theory (DST) and phenomenology as analytical frameworks, the researchers identified two main categories: 1) movement control, orientation, and insights; and 2) the individual within the group. The first category encompassed bodily improvements associated with targeted exercises, specific adjustments by physiotherapists, emotional engagement, and re-access to activities. The second category highlighted the importance of equal distributions of one-to-one interactions and attention for experiencing success in the group setting.

The study concluded that equally distributed attention and engagement, targeted exercises, and hands-on adjustments resulting in visible and perceived bodily changes were experienced as key factors of individualization in small groups. This research provides valuable insights into the experiences of individuals with MS participating in group-based, individualized physiotherapy interventions, contributing to a better understanding of how such programs can be optimized for this population.


The study focuses on an intervention called GroupCoreDIST, a physiotherapy program for individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The research was conducted by a team with diverse expertise including neurological physiotherapy, pediatric physiotherapy, philosophy, and phenomenology. 

The methodology involved semi-structured interviews with 1084 participants, analyzed using systematic text condensation. The data analysis was conducted by ECA, guided by two other researchers (BN and GKØ), and validated through discussions and workshops. Two user representatives were also part of the project group for insights.

The interview guide covered various themes such as background information, experiences from initial meetings with therapists, experiences during and after 6 weeks of group-based training, home exercises, changes in daily functioning, quality of life, and reflections on the future. 

The key findings are presented under two main categories: 'Movement Control, Orientation, and Insights' and 'The Individual Within the Group'. 

Under 'Movement Control, Orientation, and Insights', participants reported significant improvements in bodily impairments and movement control following the intervention. These improvements led to enhanced self-perception, increased outward orientation, and the ability to engage in new activities. Examples included headache cessation, improved sensation, better core muscle activation, faster gait, and increased endurance. The participants valued specific verbal instructions combined with hands-on facilitation by the physiotherapist during group sessions for achieving these improvements. 

In 'The Individual Within the Group', participants discussed their experiences within the group setting. They found it safe and beneficial, especially when they received tailored adjustments from the therapist, noticed positive bodily changes, and felt appropriately attended to by both the group and the physiotherapist. However, without these factors, the group setting could be challenging, causing individuals to focus more on their own limitations compared to others in the group.

The researchers employed reflexivity throughout the process, acknowledging their potential biases and actively striving to minimize them. They also discussed alternative interpretations of the data, considering factors such as participants' emphasis on personal performance and high focus on positive outcomes despite few negative experiences. 

In summary, this physiotherapy intervention, GroupCoreDIST, led to substantial improvements in bodily function and self-perception for individuals with MS. The group setting was generally beneficial when tailored adjustments, positive changes, and appropriate attention were provided. These findings could inform the design of future MS rehabilitation programs.


The text discusses a qualitative study on the experiences of individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) participating in a group-based physiotherapy intervention called GroupCoreDIST. The intervention aimed to improve balance, core stability, and overall function in MS patients.

Key Findings:

1. **Improvements in Symptoms and Function**: Most participants reported improvements in symptoms such as better balance, easier movement control, and increased access to daily activities, both in the short and long term. These findings align with previous research on the effects of group-based training in individuals with MS.

2. **Importance of Individualization**: Participants emphasized the significance of tailored exercises and hands-on adjustments from physiotherapists to achieve bodily improvements. They noted that seeing others perform better than themselves was sometimes frustrating, but witnessing fellow participants struggle with similar exercises increased their perception of success.

3. **Physiotherapist's Role**: Physiotherapists were described in various ways - some as skilled and enthusiastic, others strict or warm. The quality of attention from the physiotherapist was crucial; participants appreciated hands-on adjustments and individualized exercise selection based on their specific impairments.

4. **Group Dynamics**: While the group setting generally fostered a sense of unity and understanding, it could also be challenging. Some participants felt like outsiders when the physiotherapist appeared more interested in high-performing members or when they couldn't keep up with exercises.

5. **Theoretical Framework - Dynamic Systems Theory (DST)**: The study suggests that improvements in various aspects (sensory perception, core stability, balance, walking, and motivation) could be linked to changes in the participants' constraints for movement, as per DST principles. This indicates new attractor statuses regarding these activities.

6. **Phenomenological Aspects**: The study highlighted that bodily improvements were not just about neurophysiological processes but also about pre-reflective aspects of self-experience, including body schema, sense of ownership, and agency regarding body and movement. These changes updated individuals' "I can" and intentionality, creating more affordances in daily life.

7. **Group Setting Reinforcement**: Training with others who had MS made the training feel safe, motivated participants, and gave them a sense of accomplishment. Shared agency and positive comments during balance checkpoints strengthened each individual's sense of agency within the group.

8. **Methodological Considerations**: The study used a strategic sample of 13 participants from an RCT involving 40 individuals. While this might be considered small, it provided rich data due to its depth and variety. Limitations include potential bias from having one creator of the intervention conduct interviews and generalizability concerns related to EDSS scores and group size.

**Implications for Clinical Practice**: The study suggests that group interventions aiming for improved balance in MS patients should incorporate an initial individual examination, specific adaptations, and exercises tailored to each individual's symptoms. It also underscores the importance of equal attention from physiotherapists and positive reinforcement within the group setting. Future research could explore possibilities for individualization and bodily changes in larger training groups with similar EDSS levels.


The provided text is a list of research articles, books, and book chapters related to the topic of multiple sclerosis (MS) and physical therapy/rehabilitation. Here's a detailed summary of some key findings and concepts across these sources:

1. **Postural Control and Balance in MS**: Many studies highlight the importance of postural control and balance for people with MS, as they are at high risk for falls due to impairments in these areas. A study by Cameron & Lord (2010) discusses the implications of postural control deficits for fall prevention in MS patients. Similarly, a systematic review by Comber et al. (2018) found that postural control deficits are common in MS and correlate with cognitive, walking, balance, and upper limb impairments.

2. **Exercise Interventions**: Several sources emphasize the benefits of exercise interventions for managing symptoms and improving function in people with MS. A systematic review by Kalron et al. (2019) searched for active ingredients in physical rehabilitation programs to enhance mobility. Other studies, like those by Dalgas et al. (2008), Plow et al. (2009), and Snook & Motl (2009), report improvements in various aspects of function, such as balance, walking, and mobility, following specific exercise programs.

3. **Pilates as a Rehabilitation Tool**: Byrnes et al. (2018) conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of Pilates as a rehabilitation tool for people with MS. Their findings suggest that Pilates may help improve balance, mobility, and quality of life in individuals with MS.

4. **Neuroplasticity**: A few sources touch on the concept of neuroplasticity, which refers to the brain's ability to change throughout life. Gallagher (2017) discusses enactivist interventions that build on this idea, aiming to rethink the mind and promote recovery in individuals with MS or other neurological conditions.

5. **Qualitative Research**: Multiple studies employ qualitative research methods to understand the experiences of people with MS regarding their symptoms, treatment preferences, and rehabilitation processes. For example, Learmonth & Motl (2016) performed a content analysis of qualitative research on physical activity and exercise training in MS, while Normann et al. (2013) explored the embodied-enactive clinical reasoning in physical therapy using phenomenological approaches.

6. **Fall Prevention**: Fall prevention is an essential focus in many studies, as falls can lead to severe consequences for people with MS. Gunn et al. (2015) conducted a systematic review on interventions aimed at reducing falls and improving balance in individuals with MS.

7. **Anticipatory Postural Adjustments**: Some research explores the impact of MS on anticipatory postural adjustments, which are rapid body movements that help maintain balance during activities like walking or changing direction. For instance, Krishnan et al. (2012) investigated these adjustments in individuals with MS using electromyography and found impairments compared to healthy controls.

8. **Embodied Cognition**: A few sources emphasize the importance of considering embodied cognition – the idea that our mind and body are interconnected – when developing rehabilitation strategies for people with MS. Normann et al. (2016) argue for innovative physiotherapy approaches that acknowledge this connection to better support individuals with MS.

Overall, these sources highlight the complex nature of multiple sclerosis and its impact on physical functioning, postural control, balance, and fall risk. They also underscore the significance of tailored exercise interventions, such as Pilates, and the value of qualitative research in understanding patients' experiences to inform clinical practice.


### 09-Incorporation and Individuation_ On Nietzsche_s use of Phenomenology for Life

Keith Ansell Pearson's article "Incorporation and Individuation: On Nietzsche's Use of Phenomenology for Life" explores Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical project, particularly his focus on life's incorporation, and its relation to phenomenology. The author argues that understanding Nietzsche's transcendental naturalism requires comprehending it within the context of his essential thinking and specific problematic.

Pearson begins by acknowledging the labyrinthine nature of Nietzsche's work, yet he asserts that a definite project unfolds in Nietzsche's writings, which renders his thinking unique and distinctive. Unlike Husserl, whose transcendental phenomenology focuses on consciousness as the bearer of transcendentally purified experiences, Nietzsche seeks a naturalistic purification. His conception of life is crucial to understanding his philosophy, characterized by growth, expansion, assimilation, and interpretation.

The article then delves into Nietzsche's idea of truth and knowledge incorporation, starting with the first sketch of the eternal recurrence of the same. Nietzsche questions how truth can stand or endure this incorporation, challenging conventional notions of truth as absolute or objective. Instead, he proposes a new sense of phenomenon where "truth is a sign, a symptom" and philosophy becomes a "symptomatology and semiology."

Pearson highlights Nietzsche's critical reception of Schopenhauer, who posited metaphysical truth and guilty error, as crucial in understanding his estimation of semblance and apparentness. He also emphasizes the importance of Nietzsche's Spinozist inspiration, which influences his denial of free will, moral world order, and evil.

In the sketch on eternal recurrence, Nietzsche outlines a project that involves incorporating various aspects, such as fundamental errors, passions, knowledge, and life itself. This incorporation is central to understanding the "passion of knowledge" and the development of truth in modern conditions of existence.

Pearson also points out the motif of 'incorporation' in Nietzsche's work, which appears from his early writings as a plastic power conceived as a means for assimilation and digestion of experiences. This concept is intertwined with themes like repetition, interpretation, and memory.

The author argues that Nietzsche's conception of incorporation involves giving distancing insights causal presence within us by embodying them in our behavioral dispositions—essentially creating new habits. This process is portrayed as a slow sinking-in and selection, training, and discipline of thought, which becomes a transformative force over generations.

In conclusion, Pearson asserts that Nietzsche's project of "the gay science" aims to rethink truth under modern conditions, where knowledge itself has become part of life. By contemplating the incorporation of truth and knowledge, Nietzsche challenges readers to reflect on the kind of 'truth' that can be integrated into our practices while considering the general economy of life, including acknowledging the need for illusion and appearance. In doing so, we may cultivate a more complex appreciation of existence and advance life for the sake of knowledge.


Friedrich Nietzsche's critique of consciousness is a central aspect of his philosophy, which he sees as deeply implicated in human error. Unlike phenomenology that regards consciousness as a self-validating source of truth, Nietzsche views it with suspicion due to its role in perpetuating fundamental errors that have shaped human understanding and behavior.

1. **Consciousness as an Evolved Social Construct:**
   - For Nietzsche, consciousness is not a universal or necessary aspect of life but rather a byproduct of our social nature and the need for communication. It emerged under the pressure to express distress and make ourselves understood to peers, leading to the invention of signs and language.
   - Consciousness is seen as a superficial state, primarily concerned with social conventions, clichés, and accepted opinions, rather than genuine thought or perception.

2. **Selective Nature of Consciousness:**
   - Nietzsche argues that consciousness has specific selective drives (like the drive to exclude) that determine what information reaches it, thus shaping our understanding of reality.
   - This perspective suggests that there's no pure realm of thought; rather, every thought and feeling is rooted in a complex assemblage of affects and drives.

3. **Overestimation of Consciousness:**
   - Nietzsche believes consciousness has been overestimated and overvalued, leading to a misconception about its role in our lives and the world.
   - He asserts that organic life involves constant interpretation and abbreviation for practical purposes—a process not limited to human consciousness but applicable to all living beings to some extent.

4. **Critique of Metaphysics:**
   - The critique extends to metaphysics, which Nietzsche sees as a system of errors that have turned the earth into a "madhouse."
   - He aims to free ourselves from these prejudices and fears, facilitated by overcoming morality—the greatest system of errors.

5. **Implications for Knowledge:**
   - This critique has implications for our understanding of truth and knowledge. Nietzsche suggests that traditional knowledge is a form of error about itself, rooted in will to power and will to deception.
   - He advocates for new methods and modes of knowledge, focusing on the strange and overlooked aspects of life, rather than relying solely on conscious introspection or familiar perspectives.

6. **New Individual and Individuation:**
   - Nietzsche envisions a new kind of individual who transcends traditional notions of selfhood and morality. This "new" person would create their own values, rather than passively accepting societal norms or moral dictates.
   - The concept of eternal recurrence—the idea that life repeats itself infinitely—is central to this vision, serving as both a confirmation of fate and an opportunity for self-creation through the active embrace of one's irregular nature.

In essence, Nietzsche's critique of consciousness is not about its non-existence or irrelevance but about understanding it in a more nuanced way that acknowledges its limitations and socially constructed nature. This allows for the development of new perspectives on truth, knowledge, and selfhood, challenging traditional philosophical assumptions about consciousness's centrality and infallibility.


The text discusses Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy, particularly his concept of eternal recurrence and its relation to morality, individuation, and consciousness. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Eternal Recurrence**: This is the idea that everything that happens in the universe recurs infinitely. Nietzsche presents it as both a thought of 'being' (an error) and 'becoming'. It's seen as a doctrine of becoming because, despite its 'being' nature, it captures the dynamic and contingent aspects of life. 

2. **Critique of Morality**: Nietzsche's eternal recurrence is deeply intertwined with his critique of morality. He sees modern morality as a form of moralization that creates fictitious entities and beings, particularly the concept of guilt. This guilt evolved from ancient obligations to honor debts into a feeling of accountability for one's very existence, rooted in Christian-era metaphysical fictions like eternal punishment and original sin.

3. **Incorporation vs Individuation**: Nietzsche's philosophy moves beyond traditional phenomenology (which Husserl represents) by proposing a 'new law of individuality' that isn't based on the transcendental ego's personalistic consciousness. Instead, it aims to cultivate radically new individualities, challenging the phenomenological focus on subjective experience and intentionality.

4. **Consciousness**: Nietzsche doesn't reject Husserl's concept of intentional consciousness but critiques its focus. He explores consciousness within the context of life's evolution and the 'new science'. His perspective on consciousness isn't clear-cut, but he seems to view it as a form of knowing (Wissen or Erkenntnis) that can be incorporated, with error playing a crucial role in organic life's development.

5. **New Justice and Experimentation**: Nietzsche advocates for a new justice that permits individual experimentation and the cultivation of unique perspectives. This involves embracing uncertainty, pain, and the 'gay science' (a term he uses for a joyful, life-affirming approach to knowledge). 

6. **Relation to Husserl**: While not rejecting Husserl's phenomenology, Nietzsche offers a different perspective that grapples with issues like individuation and incorporation. His focus on life's strange history, the evolution of human consciousness, and the critique of morality sets him apart from phenomenological tradition.

7. **Implications**: Understanding Nietzsche requires recognizing his unique concerns and methods. Contemporary philosophy, with its 'prejudices' and neglect of life, often struggles to engage meaningfully with Nietzsche's project. Yet, fundamental issues like incorporation and individuation connect phenomenology and Nietzschean thought, suggesting potential for fruitful dialogue.

In essence, the text argues that while Nietzsche doesn't refute Husserl's phenomenology, his philosophical project—with its focus on life, evolution, and critique of morality—offers a distinct perspective that challenges and extends traditional phenomenological concerns.


### 09-Rationality as optimal choice versus rationality as valid inference

The article "Rationality as Optimal Choice versus Rationality as Valid Inference" by Alex Viscovich explores the philosophical origins of rationality in economics and its implications for how we understand human decision-making. The author argues that the prevailing neoclassical notion of rationality, which equates it with optimization or utility maximization, is flawed due to its roots in British empiricist philosophy, particularly David Hume's skepticism about reason's role in human behavior.

Hume posited that reason serves as the 'slave of the passions,' and individuals cannot determine their preferences rationally; they can only represent them vividly. This idea forms the basis for economics' instrumentalist approach to rationality, focusing on optimal choice rather than valid inference or reasoning.

The author traces this concept back to Thomas Hobbes and highlights that Hume's philosophy of mind, with its mechanistic explanation of mental phenomena, underlies mainstream economics' representation of human agents as potential functions. The paper suggests that the rationality principle in economics is limited because it misconstrues what constitutes human rationality—focusing on reason's inability to dictate actions rather than acknowledging reason's role in guiding choices based on evaluated preferences.

Viscovich also discusses how Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism provided a psychological underpinning for economics by postulating the commensurability of mental states, enabling the mathematical formalization of preference maximization. He further explains how the process of divorcing economic theory from its original psychological foundations led to the interpretation of rational choice as a universal norm rather than a specific model of behavior within an economy.

The article concludes by suggesting that to better understand human decision-making, economists should reconsider their understanding of rationality—shifting away from the flawed neoclassical notion rooted in Hume's skepticism about reason and instead embrace a valid inference model of rationality based on cognitive psychology. This would involve acknowledging that people can engage in deliberate, rule-based reasoning to guide their choices rather than merely being "boundedly rational."


The article "Rationality as Optional Choice vs. Rationality as Valid Inference" by Alex Viskovato¡ critiques the conventional economic concept of rationality, which is based on optimization and the assumption that individuals make decisions by assigning numerical values (utilities) to different options, thus selecting the one with the highest value. This view, often associated with expected utility theory, is argued to be flawed due to its origins in empiricism and its failure to account for human cognition as a thinking process.

1. Historical Critique: The author traces the roots of this economic rationality concept to the early 20th-century shift from philosophical rationalism to empiricism, particularly in response to Newtonian physics. This abandonment of a reason-based view of human action is critiqued as an unnecessary constraint on our understanding of decision-making processes.

2. Philosophical Critique: The article argues that rational choice theory (RCT), the primary expression of this economic rationality, suffers from foundationalist problems similar to those that led analytic philosophy to abandon empiricism in the mid-20th century. RCT assumes that individuals have well-ordered preferences and can consistently rank options based on these preferences, without acknowledging the role of reasoning in forming or justifying such preferences. This is seen as problematic because it neglects our capacity for reflective thought, a distinguishing feature of human cognition.

3. Empirical Critique: Viskovato¡ then turns to psychological research to support the argument against RCT's value-based approach. Studies are cited that demonstrate how individuals often make choices based on reasons rather than assigning values, and how contextual factors significantly influence decision-making. Examples include framing effects (where the presentation of a choice influences the perceived attractiveness of options), the preference for additional options in conflict situations, and the rejection of non-valued options when they're made explicit.

4. Proposal: Based on these critiques, Viskovato¡ proposes an alternative conception of rationality—rationality as valid inference. This view recognizes that individuals strive to apply reason to guide their actions rather than simply assigning values to alternatives. Inference theory can accommodate this notion, potentially offering a more accurate descriptive and normative framework for understanding human decision-making.

In conclusion, the article argues that mainstream economics' concept of rationality is problematic due to its origins in empiricism, philosophical shortcomings, and inconsistencies with psychological evidence. By shifting towards a reason-based view, economics could better reflect how people actually make decisions, potentially leading to more accurate models and insights into economic phenomena.


This text discusses the philosophical underpinnings of economic theory, specifically focusing on the concept of rationality and how it's interpreted within economics versus other philosophical schools. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Hume vs. Bentham**: The text starts by contrasting the philosophies of David Hume and Jeremy Bentham, two influential figures in the history of economic thought. Hume saw actions as driven by passions, whereas Bentham viewed them through a lens of mental states resulting from those actions. Economics has largely followed Hume's perspective, focusing on individual preferences that stand alone without being tied to the mind's process of self-production.

2. **Preferences and Utility Functions**: In mainstream economics, preferences are treated as independent entities that can be summarized in a utility function—a mathematical representation of an individual's taste or preference for certain outcomes. This function is formally similar to potential functions in physics. The text argues that this approach separates preferences from the mind's process of self-production, which Hume did not do.

3. **Kant and Practical Reason**: The authors suggest bringing back Kant's perspective on practical reason. Unlike Bentham and Hume, Kant posited that reason could provide ends to action independent of personal preferences—objectively binding rules rather than arbitrary individual desires. This Kantian view challenges the empiricist foundations of economics and rational choice theory.

4. **Wittgenstein's Norms**: The text mentions Wittgenstein's perspective on norms as grounded in practices, which offers a solution to the problem of infinite regress when following rules that rely on other rules for interpretation. However, this nuance is set aside for the sake of discussion.

5. **Preference Reversals**: Economics acknowledges the phenomenon of 'preference reversals', where individuals' choices seem inconsistent or reverse depending on how options are presented (Slovic and Lichtenstein, 1983). This undermines preferences as a fundamental category for understanding human action.

6. **Rational Choice Theory**: The text critiques rational choice theory's assumptions of 'the given' (both Humean—inherent individual preferences—and Benthamite—maximizing utility) and its portrayal of rationality as optimization or value maximization. This critique leads to the question of whether economics should remain a reflection theory, mirroring the economy's self-understanding, or strive for objectivity.

7. **Emergence of Psychological Assumptions**: Many assumptions in economic modeling are rooted in psychology—for instance, that people make decisions by comparing alternatives and choosing the one they prefer (Shar et al., 1993). This assumption is acknowledged as psychological.

8. **Critique of Foundationalism**: The text references Wilfrid Sellars' epistemic holism, suggesting that beliefs mutually support each other and cannot be justified in a foundationalist manner. In contrast, economics often assumes a more foundationalist approach to knowledge, which may not fully capture the complexities of human decision-making.

In essence, this text critically examines how economic theory conceptualizes rationality, highlighting discrepancies with broader philosophical perspectives and questioning some fundamental assumptions within economics.


### 09-Shakespeare_s Phenomenology of Time in Macbeth

Daniel Johnston's article "Shakespeare's Phenomenology of Time in Macbeth" explores the complex portrayal of time in Shakespeare's play, focusing on phenomenological concepts. The author argues that the text embodies a "doubleness" of time, where future and past entangle with the present through disruptions caused by the witches' prophecies and metatheatrical references.

Johnston begins by discussing the initial 'W' letter in the 1623 First Folio edition, symbolizing doubleness. This motif is echoed throughout Macbeth as characters encounter strange events that blur the lines between past, present, and future. The witches' gathering, for instance, creates a sense of ontological queasiness among early modern English audiences by challenging their understanding of reality and time.

The article then delves into Shakespeare's broader sense of time, highlighting how the playwright transcends his historical perspective to explore internal and external experiences of time-consciousness. Previous scholarship has identified three modes of temporality in Macbeth: sequential, cyclical, and providential time, while others have noted augmentative, contracted, and extended time.

Johnston introduces phenomenology as a philosophical lens to understand Shakespeare's portrayal of time. Phenomenology, pioneered by Edmund Husserl, emphasizes the lived experience of Being-in-the-world rather than abstract theoretical notions. Time, in this perspective, is not merely a series of discrete moments but an integral part of our embodied existence and engagement with the world.

Drawing on phenomenologists like Martin Heidegger, Johnston examines Macbeth's rejection of shared time, which contributes to the play's themes of discord and duplicity. The protagonist, Macbeth, believes his destiny is preordained, leading him to disregard temporal considerations in his actions, thus collapsing the present with a kind of past.

Johnston discusses three key phenomenological aspects of time in performance: temporal thickness (experiencing the present as heavily weighted by past and future), dissonance (disruptions in the structure of time), and materiality (time's bodily presence). These elements are central to understanding Macbeth's portrayal of time, as the play interweaves the temporality of its fictional world with the lived experience of performance.

In conclusion, Johnston's analysis demonstrates how Shakespeare employs a rich phenomenology of time in Macbeth to explore themes of authenticity, freedom, and the consequences of disregarding temporal considerations. By intertwining metatheatrical elements with the characters' experiences of time, the play reveals the complex relationship between personal agency, historical context, and the shared experience of performance.


The provided text is a scholarly analysis of William Shakespeare's play "Macbeth," focusing on the theme of time and its representation within the narrative. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Macbeth's Relationship with Time**: The author argues that Macbeth refuses to acknowledge shared time with his fellow Scots, instead using external performances to interact with them. This disregard for communal time results in an inauthentic relationship with others and sets him on a path of tragic consequences.

2. **Temporal Queasiness**: The audience experiences temporal queasiness due to Macbeth's distorted perception of time, which is highlighted by the juxtaposition of his internal monologues (revealing his inner turmoil) and the external reality of his actions.

3. **Staging Time**: The author suggests that various staging techniques can emphasize the play's temporal themes. For instance, the use of symbolism (like hourglasses or lamps swallowed by darkness) to represent time's passage, costume design to differentiate characters' experiences of time, and props to indexically demonstrate the passing of time.

4. **Macbeth's Phenomenological Resoluteness**: Despite his distorted relationship with time, Macbeth demonstrates resolute acceptance of his fate, which ultimately leads to his downfall. He refuses to acknowledge responsibility for his actions and believes that the witches' prophecies are unchangeable.

5. **Recalibration of Time**: The play's resolution comes when Malcolm restores temporal harmony by announcing plans to reconcile with exiled friends, avenge the tyrant king, and establish a new order in Scotland. This act signals the return of balance and shared time, which resonates with the audience as they witness Macbeth's tragic end.

6. **Modern Resonance**: The author raises questions about how contemporary productions can relate to these temporal themes in a modern context, emphasizing the importance of exploring phenomenological experiences and social dynamics in staging Shakespeare's works.

The analysis highlights the significance of time as both a narrative device and a thematic element within "Macbeth," examining how it shapes character relationships, propels the plot, and creates tension for the audience. The author also explores various approaches to staging these temporal aspects in performance, demonstrating the rich potential for phenomenological interpretation of Shakespeare's works.


### 10-Husserl_s phenomenology of empathy_ revisiting core insights and addressing contemporary criti

**Summary of Husserl's Phenomenology of Empathy and Responses to Critiques:**

1. **Goal and Boundaries of Empathy:**
   - Husserl's phenomenological empathy is primarily a transcendental theory that constitutes intersubjectivity and the objectivity of the world, rather than merely a form of social cognition or mutual understanding between self and other.
   - Empathy as direct perception does not aim to explain all complexities of behavior or motivations but serves a foundational role in understanding the world through intersubjective experiences.

2. **Empathy as Direct Perception:**
   - Critics like Maibom argue that empathy as direct perception faces difficulties due to ambiguities and complexities in human expressions, such as rapid facial changes or autism-related challenges in recognizing expressions.
   - Husserl's phenomenology rejects mind-body dualism, viewing the relationship between body and consciousness as an expressive unity. Empathy arises from this unified subject, using bodily expressions to access another's lived experience.

3. **Asymmetry of Empathy:**
   - Husserl emphasizes the difference between self and other, arguing that empathy does not involve identity or fusion but an experiential acquaintance with unfamiliar experiences.
   - Critics claim that this distinction creates solipsistic tendencies within empathy, as it relies on the self experiencing or sharing the other's experience to understand their perspective fully.

4. **Addressing Contemporary Critiques:**
   - This paper argues that criticisms against phenomenological empathy, such as its narrow scope and failure to explain complex motivations, are unwarranted when understood within Husserl's transcendental framework.
   - The paper contends that phenomenological empathy provides a unique contribution to both philosophical and psychological approaches to empathy by positioning it as a foundational element in the structure of objective knowledge and experience, rather than just a form of social cognition.

In conclusion, this paper aims to clarify Husserl's original contributions to phenomenological empathy, highlighting its importance for contemporary discussions on intersubjectivity and human experience. By addressing critiques and providing detailed responses, it seeks to refine our understanding of the structure, boundaries, and significance of empathy within Husserl's phenomenological theory.


The provided text discusses Edmund Husserl's phenomenological theory of empathy as outlined in his work "Cartesian Meditations." This theory emphasizes the irreducible alterity of the other, meaning that while similarity is a condition for empathy, it does not lead to fusion or identity with the other. Instead, empathy acknowledges and maintains the difference between self and other.

Key points from Husserl's phenomenology of empathy include:

1. Body-Soul Unity: Husserl posits that body and soul are not separate entities but fuse in original experience. The body is a freely moving organ of perception, acting as a center of orientation and a "here" point in our authentic domain. 

2. Dynamic Empathy: When we empathize with others, their bodies are perceived as "there," distinct from our "here." However, through mental movement (not physical), we can occupy their perspective, understanding their bodily movements as purposeful and conscious actions.

3. Embodied Expression: Husserl proposes a theory of embodied expression where the body is an organ of spiritual meaning. External bodily expressions directly indicate inner states; thus, empathizing with another's conscious experience involves perceiving their bodily expressions.

4. Asymmetry in Empathy: Husserl maintains that there is an irreducible alterity between the self and other. This asymmetry is essential for understanding intersubjective relationships, ensuring a shared objective world while preserving each subject's unique experience. 

5. Mutual Constitution: In Husserl’s view, empathy is a mutual constitution process without hierarchical order. Neither the self nor the other has absolute priority; instead, they are interdependent in constructing meaning and experience.

6. Balance of Similarity and Difference: The relationship between self and other achieves balance within asymmetry. While similarity allows pairing, difference ensures irreducibility. Thus, empathy seeks both similarity and difference, maintaining a balance that prevents either exaggeration or underestimation of differences.

7. Phenomenological vs. Psychoanalytic Approaches: Husserl's theory differs from psychoanalytic approaches that rely on imitation, which can be solipsistic. In contrast, phenomenological empathy recognizes the fundamental distance and difference between self and other while acknowledging their shared presence in the world.

In conclusion, Husserl's phenomenology of empathy is not about merging with others or fully identifying with them. Instead, it is a transcendental process revealing the structural foundation of intersubjectivity necessary for constituting an objective, shared world. This approach underscores the importance of maintaining a clear distinction between phenomenological approaches to empathy and other social cognitive theories.


The texts listed pertain to the philosophical works of Edmund Husserl, a key figure in the development of phenomenology, a branch of philosophy concerned with the study of structures of experience and consciousness. Here's a summary and explanation of each:

1. **Forschungsmanuskripten 1918-1926 (Research Manuscripts 1918-1926)**: This is likely a collection of Husserl's raw research notes or early drafts from the years 1918 to 1926. These manuscripts could provide insights into his evolving thought during this period, revealing nuances and shifts in his phenomenological ideas.

2. **Cartesianische Meditationen und Pariser Vorträge (Cartesian Meditations and Paris Lectures)**: This is an edited collection of Husserl's lectures delivered in Paris between 1927 and 1930, published posthumously in 1973. These lectures, part of his later works, explore themes such as the transcendental ego, time-consciousness, and intersubjectivity.

3. **Ideen zu einer reinen Phänomenologie und phänomenologischen Philosophie II: Phänomenologische Untersuchungen zur Konstitution (Ideas Toward a Pure Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy II: Phenomenological Investigations on Constitution)**: This is the second volume of Husserl's magnum opus, "Ideen." Published in 1952, it delves into topics like the constitution of temporal objects and the structure of intentionality.

4-6. **Zur Phänomenologie der Intersubjektivität (On the Phenomenology of Intersubjectivity)**: These three volumes, published in 1973, contain texts from Husserl's posthumous Nachlass (estate). They explore the phenomenological aspects of intersubjectivity - the shared understanding and experiences between subjects. The first part covers 1905-1920, the second 1921-1928, and the third 1929-1935.

### 10-In search of the pleasure of moving through bodily re-explorations and interactions with the s

Title: Summary of "In search of the pleasure of moving through bodily re-explorations and interactions with the surroundings: a qualitative study on changed perceptions of physical activity in people with mild multiple sclerosis"

This qualitative study, published in Physiotherapy Theory and Practice, explores how individuals with mild multiple sclerosis (MS) perceive physical activity (PA) and the impact of various factors on their engagement in PA. The researchers used an enactive theory perspective to understand the complex aspects that influence the sense-making processes related to PA among people with low MS disability.

Key findings:

1. Perception Shifts after Diagnosis:
   - Participants' views of PA changed post-diagnosis due to concerns about bodily capacities, safety, and uncertainty regarding future capabilities.
   - Despite pre-MS exercise habits, many reduced participation or anticipated future decreased activity levels because of MS symptoms.
   - Goals shifted towards maintaining daily activities, social engagement, and employment rather than structured exercises.

2. Affective Experiences Drive Behavior:
   - Pleasure associated with movement was a significant motivator for PA.
   - Discomfort, fear, and uncertainty could hinder PA engagement.
   - Participants sought new challenges or directions to maintain motivation.

3. Surroundings Influence Perceptions:
   - Social interactions and outdoor environments were desired to improve PA.
   - Healthcare professionals' support was crucial for enabling PA opportunities, but tailored follow-up was often lacking in early stages of MS.

The study highlights the need for early healthcare interventions focused on promoting PA among individuals with low MS disability to maintain essential sensorimotor functions and enhance disease-modifying effects. The enactive theory perspective emphasizes action-oriented processes, affect, and environmental factors in shaping perceptions of PA, offering a comprehensive understanding that can inform refined healthcare services for pwMS.

The researchers used systematic text condensation to analyze the data, and their diverse backgrounds (physiotherapists, enactive theory experts) ensured critical perspectives in interpreting the results. The study's implications include developing tailored PA interventions that consider individuals' emotional experiences and environmental contexts for optimal engagement among pwMS with low disability levels.


This study explores how individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) perceive physical activity (PA), focusing on changes in attitudes, bodily experiences, and the influence of surroundings. Here's a detailed summary and explanation of the key findings:

1. **Shift in Attitudes Toward PA**: After an MS diagnosis, participants experienced shifts in their attitudes towards PA. They needed to re-explore their bodily capacities due to altered sensorimotor functions, balance, mobility, or energy levels. This was especially true during the initial period post-diagnosis when uncertainties about maintaining prior PA levels and the prospects of PA with MS were high.

2. **Affective Experiences as Drivers/Barriers**: The study highlights that affective experiences significantly influence PA engagement in pwMS. Positive affects, such as pleasure or improved mood, serve as drivers for participation. Conversely, negative emotions (discomfort, pain, fatigue) can act as barriers to adherence.

3. **Perception of PA and Surroundings**: The perception of PA is intricately linked with professional, social, and environmental interactions. Social support, especially during group activities, enhances enjoyment and makes strenuous activities easier. Meanwhile, a natural outdoor environment provides mental benefits like clarity of mind and distraction from negative thoughts about MS.

4. **Professional Support**: Participants emphasized the need for more individualized professional follow-up to optimize their PA. They reported feeling unprepared and lacking guidance in maintaining or increasing their physical activity post-diagnosis, often requiring personalized exercise plans to boost confidence and address specific impairments.

5. **Fear as a Central Theme**: Fear played multiple roles in the participants' PA behavior. It was associated with potential loss of function (observing others with worse symptoms), fear of burdening others, and even fear of negative health consequences from high-intensity exercise like dizziness or pain exacerbation.

6. **Bidirectional Relationship Between Movement and Affect**: The study reveals a complex relationship between physical movement and affective state. PA can lead to positive affects (pleasure, improved mood), but disruptions in this flow due to MS symptoms can negatively impact self-regulation and overall PA engagement.

7. **Enactive Perspective**: The findings align with the enactive theory, emphasizing that our experiences of movement are not just physiological responses but also involve perceptual and phenomenological aspects of the body. Disruptions in movement flow due to MS symptoms can disrupt this experience, affecting PA engagement.

In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of a holistic approach to understanding PA engagement in pwMS with mild disability. It highlights the need for personalized professional support, considering individual capacities, attitudes towards PA, and their unique social and environmental contexts. This comprehensive view can help tailor interventions to better promote PA in this population, addressing both physical and psychological aspects of MS-related challenges.


The text presented is a scholarly article discussing the factors influencing physical activity (PA) engagement among individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), specifically those with mild disability. The study used an enactive framework, which emphasizes the interplay between movement and affectivity (emotions and feelings).

Key Findings:

1. **Affectivity's Role**: Affectivity, derived from personal, interpersonal, and environmental interactions, plays a significant role in driving PA engagement. This suggests that how individuals feel about moving is crucial for their participation in PA.

2. **Multifaceted Pleasure of Moving**: The study highlights the multifaceted pleasure derived from movement as a potential game-changer for improving PA in this population. It underscores the importance of enjoying and finding meaning in physical activities.

3. **Restricted Affordances Post-Diagnosis**: Participants' restricted affordances for PA after their diagnosis accentuate the need for early, tailored professional follow-up. This implies that individuals with MS may require additional support to overcome barriers and maintain an active lifestyle post-diagnosis.

4. **Professional Follow-up Recommendations**: The study suggests that professional follow-up should include explorations of both: (1) movements and activities together with a professional to build trust, optimize performance, and enhance the affective experience of PA; and (2) affordances of relevant social and physical environments contributing to PA engagement.

5. **Model Proposal**: Based on these findings, the authors propose a model for understanding complex PA engagement in people with low MS disability. This model emphasizes the importance of affectivity and tailored professional follow-up.

Limitations and Cautions:

1. **Cultural Context**: The study's findings should be interpreted cautiously outside the specific environmental or cultural contexts in which they were observed.

2. **Participant Involvement**: A limitation of the study was that participants' transcripts were not returned for comments, potentially affecting the accuracy of portraying their unique perspectives and understandings (Tong et al., 2007).

3. **Alternative Theoretical Frameworks**: While the enactive framework provided nuanced insights, alternative theoretical frameworks could generate different perspectives on these results.

In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of affective experiences and tailored professional support in promoting physical activity among people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) with mild disability. It suggests that understanding and addressing the multifaceted pleasure derived from movement can be a crucial strategy for enhancing PA engagement in this population. Further studies are warranted to develop and examine the proposed model, particularly in the follow-up of pwMS.


### 10-Presence_ objecthood_ and the phenomenology of predictive perception

The article by Anil K. Seth discusses the concept of "Presence" in perception, its relationship with objecthood, and the phenomenology of predictive perception within the framework of Predictive Processing (PP). Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Predictive Processing (PP)**: PP is a theoretical approach suggesting that perception and action are fundamentally about generating predictions about sensory inputs, with these predictions being updated based on prediction errors. This process involves counterfactual reasoning – considering how sensory inputs would change under different possible actions.

2. **Predictive Processing of Sensorimotor Contingencies (PPSMC)**: PPSMC is a specific application of PP to the realm of sensorimotor contingencies, which are the relationships between actions and their resulting sensory feedback. It posits that perceptual presence – the sense that objects in our perception seem "real" – arises from the richness of these predictive models.

3. **Counterfactual Richness**: PPSMC suggests that perceptual presence depends on the counterfactual richness of predictive models. This means how well the model can anticipate the sensory consequences of various actions. For instance, in synesthesia (where a letter's color is experienced alongside it), the lack of such rich counterfactual associations might explain why the colors are perceived as less 'real' or present compared to the letters.

4. **Presence vs Objecthood**: Several commentators have pointed out a distinction between presence and objecthood. While both are aspects of perception, they are not independent. Presence refers to the sense that an object is real, while objecthood pertains to recognizing something as an object distinct from its surroundings. In PP terms, objecthood depends on predictive models encoding hierarchically-deep invariances – complex mappings between hidden causes and sensory signals.

5. **Hierarchical Depth and Counterfactual Richness**: Seth argues that there's a mutual dependency between counterfactual richness (the ability to anticipate various sensorimotor outcomes) and hierarchical depth (how deeply these predictions can capture invariances across different situations). This relationship supports the extraction of world-revealing, invariant features from sensory data.

6. **Active Inference**: Active inference, a component of PP, involves selecting actions to optimize perception by minimizing prediction errors. Seth suggests that active inference implies counterfactual processing – considering how sensory inputs would change under various possible actions. This not only helps in confirming predictions but also in disambiguating competing hypotheses or trying to disprove them, reflecting a scientific approach to perception.

7. **Expectations about Counterfactual Richness**: Seth introduces the idea that expectations about counterfactual richness play a crucial role in PP. These expectations, which specify how well a model can predict various sensorimotor outcomes, are linked to aspects of phenomenology such as "world-revealing presence."

8. **Functional Role of Perceptual Presence**: Metzinger suggests that the epistemic reliability or confidence in perceptual judgments might increase with the counterfactual richness of a model, implying a functional role for perceptual presence in enhancing our certainty about accurately capturing invariant features of reality.

In essence, Seth's article delves into how predictive processing theory can explain subjective aspects of perception, like the sense of 'realness' or presence we attribute to perceived objects. It highlights the importance of counterfactual reasoning and hierarchical depth in these processes, while also acknowledging ongoing debates and challenges within this theoretical framework.


The text discusses the concept of "presence" in perception, particularly focusing on two aspects: world-revealing presence (or objecthood) and phenomenal unreality. 

1. World-revealing Presence/Objecthood: This refers to a rich, detailed perceptual experience tied to hierarchically deep predictive models, which involve counterfactual expectations. Examples include the visual impression of a blue sky or the smell of the sea. These experiences lack the phenomenology of objecthood because there's little one can do to alter the sensory input, and hidden causes are unlikely to lie behind multiple inferential layers. 

2. Phenomenal Unreality: This is a less rich perceptual experience, not as tied to deep predictive models, exemplified by perceptual afterimages or synesthetic concurrents. Despite their lack of world-revealing presence, they aren't experienced as "unreal" in the same way as afterimages or synesthetic concurrents are. 

The author suggests that the distinction between these two types of experiences can be understood through the concept of "transparency" in representational machinery. Transparency means that the system lacks introspective access to non-intentional properties of its representations and is unaware of the construction process. This transparency is lost when the "construction process" becomes available for attentional processing, leading to phenomenal unrealness where perceptual content is experienced as mind-related rather than world-related.

In Predictive Processing with Schema and Mental Concepts (PPSMC), a loss of transparency can arise from an inferential failure to separate hidden causes in the world from those associated with the perceiver, which occurs due to violations of counterfactual predictions. For instance, perceptual afterimages violate these counterfactual predictions tied to active inference, leading to phenomenal unrealness. 

The text also revisits synesthesia, distinguishing between a negative component (absence of world-revealing presence due to lacking hierarchically deep generative models) and a positive component (experience of phenomenal unreality from inferential failures). It suggests that understanding individual differences in synesthesia could provide insights into how "priors" are acquired.

Finally, the text highlights the need for further research, including formal development of theoretical proposals, simulation models, and experimental tests using augmented reality to manipulate sensorimotor mappings and counterfactual predictions. It also hints at exploring the role of the body in shaping these experiences, particularly how bodily constraints influence counterfactual expectations and how changes in action repertoires might alter experiences of presence over time.


The references provided here pertain to various scientific studies and theories related to predictive processing, perception, consciousness, synesthesia, and cognitive science. Here's a detailed explanation of some key papers:

1. Friston, K. J. (2010). The free-energy principle: A rough guide to the brain? Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 13(7), 293-301. doi:10.1016/j.tics.2009.04.005

This paper introduces the free-energy principle (FEP) as a unifying theory of brain function. The FEP posits that the brain is an engine for prediction, constantly generating hypotheses about the world and minimizing prediction error by adjusting its internal models. It suggests that perception, action, learning, and consciousness are all expressions of this predictive process.

2. Clark, A. (2013). Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 36(3), 181-204. doi:10.1017/S0140525X12000477

In this paper, Clark discusses the predictive brain hypothesis, arguing that perception is not merely a passive response to sensory input but an active process of prediction and inference. He suggests that this perspective can unify cognitive science by emphasizing the role of anticipation in shaping our mental life.

3. Seth, A. K. (2014). A predictive processing theory of sensorimotor contingencies: Explaining the puzzle of perceptual presence and its absence in synesthesia. Cognitive Neuroscience, 5(2), 97-118. doi:10.1080/17588928.2013.877880

This paper proposes a predictive processing theory to account for perceptual presence—the feeling of "being there" during perception—and its absence in synesthesia. Seth suggests that perceptual presence arises from the match between sensory input and internal predictions, which can be disrupted in synesthetic experiences due to altered predictive mappings.

This study explores whether adult synesthesia can be induced through training. Participants were instructed to associate arbitrary colors with specific graphemes (letters) over several weeks. Results showed that participants developed color-grapheme associations, suggesting the malleability of synesthetic experiences and their compatibility with predictive processing models.

5. Di Paolo, E. A. (2014). The worldly constituents of perceptual presence. Frontiers in Psychology, 5, 450. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00450

Di Paolo argues that perceptual presence arises from the dynamic interplay between an organism and its environment—a process he terms "worldly constituents." He emphasizes the importance of considering the active role of the perceiver in shaping their perceptual experiences.

6. Van Leeuwen, T. M. (2014). Constructing priors in synesthesia. Cognitive Neuroscience, 5(2), 124-126. doi:10.1080/17588928.2014.905520

Van Leeuwen discusses the role of prior expectations or "priors" in shaping synesthetic experiences. He suggests that individual differences among synesthetes—such as projector vs. associator types—might be explained by variations in these predictive priors.

These studies and theories contribute to our understanding of perception, consciousness, and synesthesia through a lens of predictive processing, emphasizing the active role of the brain in generating hypotheses about the world. They highlight how internal models constantly generate predictions that are updated based on sensory feedback, ultimately shaping our mental experiences.


### 10-Rationales of risk and uncertainty and their epistemological foundation by new phenomenology

The article "Rationales of risk and uncertainty and their epistemological foundation by new phenomenology" by Manuel Schulz and Jens O. Zinn discusses the challenges in understanding and managing risk, as often there is a gap between subjective and objective evaluations of risks. The authors propose that this issue can be attributed to a tension between subjective and objectified forms of certitudes, which they argue can be better understood through the lens of New Phenomenology.

New Phenomenology, developed by Hermann Schmitz, provides an empirically based understanding of subjective experience that distinguishes two dimensions of self-consciousness: reflexive and non-reflexive knowledge. Reflexive knowledge involves symbol-mediated thinking and the creation of objectivations through symbolic representations, while non-reflexive knowledge refers to involuntary sensations that occur to the subject on the level of duration.

The authors then introduce a model with three forms of knowledge involved in subjective risk management:

1. **Subjective facts**: These are sensible certitudes that arise from bodily sensations, such as trust and intuition. They are highly subjective but evident to the self on an immediate level.
2. **Rational facts**: These are empirically grounded objectifications resulting from past observations and statistical data. Examples include medical treatment survival rates or historical trends in disease prevalence.
3. **Non-rational facts (Hope and Faith)**: These are imaginative extensions of one's horizon, focusing on a desired future. They are rooted in subjective lifeworld but less empirically grounded compared to rational facts. Examples include faith in divine intervention or hope for a positive outcome despite low statistical probabilities.

The authors highlight that all three forms of knowledge are essential in managing risk, as they cater to different aspects of human cognition and experience. Rational facts provide concrete data and evidence, while non-rational facts (hope and faith) help individuals cope with uncertainty and motivate action. Subjective facts, like trust and intuition, bridge the gap between personal experiences and objective information, enabling individuals to make informed decisions based on their unique circumstances.

In conclusion, understanding these epistemological differences is crucial for effective risk communication. The authors argue that acknowledging and integrating subjective experiences, alongside rational facts, will lead to more successful risk management strategies. This approach should involve deliberative, participative, and procedural legitimacy in decision-making processes, ensuring that the subjective, embodied, and experience-based realities of risk are taken into account.


The text discusses the concept of risk management, focusing on the role of subjective certitudes such as trust, intuition, hope, and faith. It argues that these forms of knowledge are integral to how individuals perceive and manage risks in their daily lives, despite not being based solely on empirical evidence or rational thinking.

1. **Trust**: This is described as a form of non-reflexive knowledge deeply rooted in one's experience of the life world. It's established through repeated interactions and shared understandings with others. Trustworthiness, as experienced subjectively, can differ from an empirically based interpretation of risk.

2. **Intuition**: This is portrayed as an immediate embodied experience of a risky situation, often influencing quick decisions without conscious reasoning. It's grounded in personal experiences and bodily sensations, making it less amenable to communication or change through rational argumentation.

3. **Hope**: Unlike trust and intuition, hope is less institutionalized but equally subjective. It extends one's horizon beyond current empirical conditions, providing a positive outlook on future possibilities. Hope can be powerful in engaging with high-risk activities as it allows individuals to envision and strive for better alternatives.

4. **Faith**: Similarly detached from empirical reality, faith is strongly connected to the subjective lifeworld. It's based on personal, mental states rather than external conditions. Despite its lack of empirical grounding, faith can lead to active engagement with the world, as individuals interpret risks within a framework of divine providence or destiny.

The authors emphasize that these non-rational forms of knowledge play crucial roles in subjective risk management. They challenge traditional, evidence-based approaches to risk communication, suggesting that people often rely on these subjective certitudes for managing uncertainties in their lives. 

In the context of risk communication, this poses challenges as scientific expertise may not align with these personal beliefs and experiences. The authors propose a shift towards participatory and deliberative approaches that acknowledge and respect individuals' subjective realities while maintaining procedural legitimacy. They argue for a relational understanding of risk management, focusing on building trust and fostering dialogue between involved parties rather than merely conveying expert information. 

This perspective is significant because it acknowledges the complexity of human responses to risk, moving beyond purely rational or empirical models. It underscores the need for risk communication strategies that are sensitive to people's lived experiences and subjective certitudes.


### 10-Some Reflections in Phenomenology and Psychoanalysis

This paper explores the relationship between phenomenology and psychoanalysis, aiming to develop a future phenomenology that can engage with the latter's grounds productively. The author begins by tracing the origins of phenomenology, highlighting its evolution through key philosophers such as Lambert, Kant, Hegel, Husserl, and others. Phenomenology, according to this account, is concerned with "appearances" or "true (or objective) appearances," which are not limited by empirical reality but rather refer to an absolute reality that remains material under every phenomenal disposition.

The author asserts that phenomenology, in its essence, is a science of the margins—a making and interpretation of distinctions, encoding laws of form, and gathering "figures" (straightforward perceptions) that challenge one's sense of reality. This approach resonated with Chinese philosophy, particularly during the 1920s to 1940s, where phenomenology was embraced by thinkers like Xiong Wei and Cheng Chung-ying due to its alignment with their idiomatic and textual history.

Brentano's contribution is highlighted as he emphasizes the special connection between mental presentations and their objects, rejecting unconscious determining factors by recognizing "missing steps" in analogy for other mental phenomena like judgment and desire/love. This distinction, according to Brentano, is a form of illusion or Schein, closer to Gestalt psychology's concept of metastability.

The author then discusses intention and intensity as inextricably bound, using St Augustine's notion of intentio animi (the orientation of all the attention of which the soul is capable). Intention is conceptualized as the minimal identification of a transversal or an inward projection, serving as a cogitating factor or transducer for responsibility. For instance, when driving and focusing on a matter of interest, one's attention shifts when encountering an anomaly due to instinctual tendencies.

The paper also briefly touches upon psychoanalysis' relationship with intention, noting that both forget or minimize its role in identifying instincts. An "anti-phenomenology" is proposed as a reduction of consciousness rather than to it, offering an extra-material core for dialectic and psychical materialism. The author suggests that phenomenology and psychoanalysis can coexist without one rejecting or supplanting the other entirely.

In summary, this paper attempts to bridge phenomenology and psychoanalysis by revisiting their origins, focusing on distinctions, intentions, and instincts. The author argues for a future phenomenology that acknowledges and engages with the unconscious aspects of human experience, aligning it more closely with psychoanalytic theory.


The provided text is a philosophical exploration by Hsiang Hsu that discusses the relationship between phenomenology and psychoanalysis, two distinct fields of study within the broader realm of human understanding. 

1. **Phenomenology and Psychoanalysis**: Phenomenology, as perceived by the author, is concerned with intentionality – the study of consciousness and its directedness towards objects or experiences. On the other hand, psychoanalysis deals with instincts, driven by unconscious desires, without relying on conscious cognition. 

2. **The Science of Intention vs Instinct**: The author proposes that phenomenology focuses on intentional distinctions, while psychoanalysis centers around instinctual reasoning lacking explicit cognitive content. Both disciplines, however, are forms of direct inference, each offering unique insights into human nature and experience.

3. **Castoriadis' Insight**: The text references Castoriadis's idea that no intention can be isolated; all intentions exist within a broader unconscious horizon of the subject. This unconscious horizon, according to Castoriadis, reaches towards the void of possibilities yet to come.

4. **Ricoeur on Freudianism**: The author mentions philosopher Paul Ricoeur's distinction between four key elements in Freudian analysis: reduction (intentionality of alterity), language as 'mastery', and intersubjectivity, which orient the 'unconscious of phenomenology' towards the 'preconscious of psychoanalysis'.

5. **Henry's Critique**: Michel Henry critiques Ricoeur’s approach, suggesting that reintroducing Freudian energetics into a representational-based psychology might compromise its originality. 

6. **Psychoanalysis as Science of Non-Extant Things**: Hsu argues that psychoanalysis studies 'live but non-extant things' – elements like sexuality, which aren't necessary for life itself but for existence and repetition. It aims to understand how these aspects are bound in repetitive patterns within individuals, a process central to therapeutic work in psychoanalysis.

7. **Surface vs Depth**: The text introduces the concept of 'surface' in psychoanalytic theory as an 'after-image' or absolute externalization of identificatory processes onto autonomous realities. It challenges the traditional view of horror lurking beneath a surface, suggesting that the very surface itself is terrifying due to its unfathomable, depthless nature.

8. **Emergence of Skin Ego**: The author references Esther Bick's work on 'skin ego,' describing how early object relations form a sense of self through the assimilation of various personality parts into a selective 'second skin.' 

9. **Psychoanalysis and Irony**: Lastly, Hsu posits that psychoanalysis exists in an ironic space, balancing the externalization of meaning (language) with the internal repression of unconscious processes, ultimately seeking to understand how individual identities are formed amidst these complex dynamics.

The text weaves together various philosophical and psychoanalytic concepts, drawing connections and offering a nuanced perspective on their interrelation, particularly focusing on the themes of intentionality, instinct, repetition, and the nature of self-understanding within both phenomenology and psychoanalysis.


1. **Paul Ricoeur's "Conversations in Art and Psychoanalysis" (1968)**

   This work is a collection of conversations between French philosopher Paul Ricoeur and psychoanalyst Jean Laplanche, conducted in September 1962. The dialogues explore the intersection of art and psychoanalysis, delving into topics such as dreams, myths, literature, and symbolism from a psychoanalytic perspective. Ricoeur, at this time, was examining the potential for psychoanalytic theory to inform his philosophical work on narrative and identity.

2. **Paul Ricoeur's "Freud and Philosophy" (1970)**

   Originally a series of lectures presented at Yale University between 1961-1962, this book offers a philosophical interpretation of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory. Ricoeur engages with Freud's ideas on the unconscious, dreams, and the Oedipus complex, drawing parallels with phenomenology (a philosophical approach that emphasizes experience and consciousness) and existentialism. The book is a significant contribution to analytic philosophy, particularly in the domain of mind and consciousness studies.

3. **Trân Văn Khiêm's "Investigations into the Origin of Language and Consciousness" (1984)**

   This work, originally published in 1973, presents a phenomenological analysis of language and consciousness. The author, Vietnamese philosopher Trân Văn Khiêm, argues that consciousness arises from linguistic practices, suggesting an inverse relationship between language and consciousness. He posits that our understanding of the world is inherently tied to linguistic structures and social interactions.

4. **Trân Văn Khiêm's "Phenomenology and Dialectical Materialism" (1986)**

   Published originally in 1951, this work explores the intersection of phenomenology (a philosophical movement initiated by Edmund Husserl) and dialectical materialism (the application of Hegelian dialectics to historical materialism). Khiêm argues for a synthesis of these two traditions, suggesting that phenomenological insights can enrich Marxist theory, particularly in understanding human experience and consciousness.

5. **Simone Weil's "Reflections on the Right Use of School Studies with a View to the Love of God" (2001)**

   Originally published in French as 'Attente de Dieu' in 1951, this work reflects on the nature and purpose of education. Weil, a French philosopher and activist, emphasizes the importance of intellectual humility, contemplation, and love as guiding principles for learning. She argues that true knowledge leads to a deeper understanding and appreciation of God, promoting an educational approach centered on spiritual growth rather than mere acquisition of facts or skills.

6. **Yang Ruey-Guan's "Introduction to Phenomenology" (1929)**

   Although the provided text is incomplete, this work likely offers a foundational overview of phenomenology for Chinese readers. Published in Min Duo magazine, volume 1, issue 10, it could have covered key themes such as intentionality (the directedness of consciousness towards objects), epoché (suspension of judgment), and the phenomenological reduction – methods used by phenomenologists to describe and understand experiences as they are lived. As an introduction, it would have aimed to elucidate these complex concepts in an accessible manner.


### 11-Epistemic Privilege_ Phenomenology and Symptomatology in Functional_Dissociative Seizures

The article "Epistemic Privilege, Phenomenology and Symptomatology in Functional/Dissociative Seizures" by Alistair Wardrope and Heather Stewart explores the epistemic dynamics between patients with functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) and clinicians. The authors challenge the common assumption that patients have unique, first-hand knowledge of their illness experiences, which is often referred to as 'epistemic privilege.'

The paper begins by outlining the standard narrative in clinical encounters: patients report their subjective experiences, and clinicians use their expertise to interpret these reports in pathological terms. This division of epistemic labor assumes that patients have immediate access to their own bodily sensations, while clinicians possess the authority to explain, diagnose, and treat these experiences.

However, Wardrope and Stewart argue that this view is overly simplistic. They introduce the concept of 'surface phenomenology,' which refers to patients' initial, often incomplete or inaccurate descriptions of their seizure experiences. In contrast, 'reflective phenomenology' denotes more detailed, nuanced accounts produced through guided exploration with a clinician's support.

The authors use FDS as a case study to illustrate their argument. FDS are paroxysmal episodes of altered bodily awareness and control that can be mistaken for epileptic seizures. Research shows that patients' initial reports of their seizure experiences (surface phenomenology) often differ from more detailed, reflective accounts produced with clinical support.

For instance, patients with FDS may initially report a complete 'blackout' during seizures, lacking any conscious awareness or agency. However, further exploration reveals that they actually have some degree of ictal consciousness and agency. This discrepancy between surface and reflective phenomenology demonstrates that patients may not always have immediate access to their own experiences.

The authors suggest that clinicians' expertise in disease phenomenology can help bridge this gap. By engaging in a collaborative process of reflective phenomenology, clinicians can guide patients towards more accurate and nuanced self-reporting. This process respects patients' epistemic agency while also leveraging clinicians' knowledge to improve diagnosis and treatment.

The paper concludes by arguing that epistemic justice in the clinical encounter is not solely about acknowledging patient testimony or dismissing it but involves a collaborative process of mutual understanding and knowledge exchange. It suggests that recognizing patients' epistemic privilege does not mean blindly accepting their initial reports; instead, it requires clinicians to engage in a respectful dialogue that can help patients articulate their experiences more fully.

In essence, Wardrope and Stewart challenge the notion of unqualified patient epistemic privilege and propose a more nuanced view of clinical knowledge exchange. They argue for an interactive and collaborative approach to epistemic justice in healthcare, where both patients and clinicians contribute to creating shared understanding and accurate diagnoses.


The text discusses the challenges patients face in clinical encounters, particularly the issue of epistemic injustice, where their experiences and perspectives may be dismissed or undervalued. This can occur due to power imbalances, with clinicians often holding more authority, leading to a fear among patients that their concerns will not be taken seriously.

To address this issue, the authors propose several potential improvements at individual, interpersonal, and structural levels:

1. **Individual Level**: Encouraging epistemic humility in clinicians is suggested as a solution. This virtue involves acknowledging the limits of one's own knowledge and appreciating others' intellectual strengths. By recognizing the fallibility of their own methods (such as third-personal investigations that only provide partial pictures) or the uncertainty in medical decision-making, clinicians may be more open to patients' experiences. When patients perceive this humility, they might feel more comfortable sharing their concerns and acknowledging their limitations.

2. **Interpersonal Level**: The authors highlight the importance of shared understanding and cooperation between clinicians and patients in interpreting patient experiences. This interpretation should be seen as a joint act rather than solely the clinician's task. Identifying mutual goals and coordinating objectives can foster effective communication and collaboration.

3. **Structural Level**: Addressing systemic issues is crucial to enabling robust epistemic peerhood between clinicians and patients. This includes recognizing historical and ongoing injustices that may lead to patient distrust of healthcare institutions (such as bias, stereotyping, and microaggressions). Ensuring clinicians have adequate time and resources for meaningful dialogue during encounters is also vital. Moreover, the authors suggest challenging biomedical scientism that assumes medical descriptions contain all relevant information about illness experiences.

The authors argue that epistemically just clinical practice cannot be achieved through quick fixes; it requires active collaboration and understanding between patients and clinicians to arrive at the best phenomenological and clinical understanding. They emphasize the need for further research to better understand how to enable such robust epistemic peerhood, focusing on individual, interpersonal, and structural features of just clinical knowledge exchange.


### 11-Husserl_ Phenomenology_ and Foundationalism

Walter Hopp's paper "Husserl, Phenomenology, and Foundationalism" argues against the view that phenomenology provides an epistemological foundation for non-phenomenological knowledge. He posits that Husserl did not endorse such a foundationalist position, despite common interpretations suggesting otherwise.

1. **Husserl's Foundationalism Interpretation**: Hopp first reviews various commentators who attribute a strong form of foundationalism to Husserl, according to which phenomenological knowledge undergirds all other knowledge. This interpretation suggests that every piece of non-phenomenological knowledge is epistemically founded on phenomenological knowledge (EPF-2).

2. **Critique of Epistemological Foundationalism**: Hopp argues against this form of foundationalism using three main considerations:

   a. **Husserl's Rejection of Absolute Certainty**: Husserl explicitly rejected the idea that any science could be based on absolutely certain truths, which contradicts EPF-1 (that basic beliefs must be certain).
   
   b. **Incompleteness of Transcendental Analysis**: Husserl saw transcendental analysis as inherently incomplete and capable of endless refinement, undermining the idea that phenomenology could provide definitive epistemological foundations (EPF-2).
   
   c. **Rejection of Phenomenology as Axioms**: Husserl did not view phenomenological propositions as axioms from which other knowledge is derived, contradicting EPF's structure.

3. **Husserl's Epistemological Externalism**: Hopp argues that Husserl actually held an epistemological externalist position. Externalism asserts that the justification of beliefs does not depend solely on introspective access to reasons or evidence within one's mind. Instead, it considers factors such as environmental and historical circumstances. For instance, fulfillment in phenomenology is about the intuitive content of experiences, which may not always be propositional or introspectively accessible, yet crucial for knowledge acquisition.

4. **Critique of Internalist Foundationalism**: Hopp critiques internalist foundationalist arguments (like Bonjour's) that necessitate self-awareness and introspective access to justification reasons. He argues that this view is implausible, as it suggests that creatures like animals or young children lack knowledge due to their inability to reflect on epistemic principles—a claim Hopp finds phenomenologically dubious.

   a. **Internalism vs. Externalism**: Hopp distinguishes between justification reasons (evidence supporting beliefs) and reasons for warrant (underlying conditions making beliefs likely to be true). He suggests that these are not always the same, especially in cases of necessary truths or intuitive knowledge.
   
   b. **The Dilemma for Internalism**: Hopp proposes a dilemma for strong internalist views—either they trivialize premise (2) by making it universally true but render premise (3) implausible, requiring justified beliefs about one's own epistemic states, or they commit to an unrealistic view where knowledge creation and justification are inseparably tied to introspective reflection on epistemic principles.

Conclusion: Hopp concludes that phenomenology, while crucial for understanding the structure of experience and intentionality, does not function as a foundational base for all human knowledge. Instead, he suggests that phenomenology provides valuable insights into the nature of knowing, contributing to our understanding without serving as an epistemological foundation. Husserl's actual views seem more aligned with externalist positions, recognizing the broader factors influencing knowledge acquisition and justification.


The text discusses Edmund Husserl's philosophical views on epistemology, focusing on his relationship with foundationalism and internalism. 

1. Internalism vs Externalism: The author introduces the distinction between internalism (asserting that all justifying factors for a belief must be cognitively accessible to the believer) and externalism (allowing some justifying factors to not be cognitively accessible). 

2. Bonjour's Position: It is noted that philosopher Laurence Bonjour endorses internalism, requiring one to justifiably believe both the feature of a belief and its likelihood of being true for it to be epistemically justified. 

3. Drummond's Stance: The text suggests that while it is not entirely clear if philosopher John Drummond endorses strong internalism, his arguments imply a possible agreement with this position. Drummond argues that one must justifiably believe specific claims about their beliefs to assert them as foundational, which aligns with internalist views. 

4. Critique of Strong Internalism: The author presents an argument against strong internalism, suggesting that it is implausible for every knower to possess a body of concepts and knowledge not all knowers have. This implies that scientists, mathematicians, logicians, and ordinary non-specialists would lack knowledge in the absence of phenomenological knowledge. 

5. Husserl's Epistemology: The text then delves into Husserl's views on epistemology, exploring whether he endorsed something akin to Epistemic Foundationalism (EPF). The author argues that while there are passages suggesting Husserl may have held such views, direct and indirect evidence indicates otherwise. 

6. Direct Evidence Against EPF: It is shown that Husserl's statements, like asserting the objective truth of mathematical and natural scientific theories, suggest these sciences produce knowledge or warranted beliefs without necessarily requiring phenomenological foundations. 

7. Indirect Evidence Against EPF: The text further argues that Husserl's descriptions of knowing do not involve reflective intentional acts upon one's own cognitive processes, which contradicts the requirements of EPF. Additionally, Husserl's "Principle of All Principles" implies that intuitive presentations are sufficient for warrant and knowledge, without necessitating knowledge of the principle itself or one's adherence to it. 

8. Conclusion on Husserl's Views: The author concludes that while Husserl may not have been an Epistemic Foundationalist in the traditional sense, he was not necessarily rejecting foundationalism altogether. Instead, his philosophy is consistent with a form of externalism regarding epistemic principles and mental acts, allowing for knowledge without conscious awareness or explicit application of these principles. 

9. Phenomenology's Role: The text highlights phenomenology's role in providing justifications for our beliefs by elucidating the nature of cognitive processes that render them warranted, rather than generating the justifying reasons themselves. This approach protects scientific knowledge from philosophical falsification and preserves the sense of ordinary and scientific assertions. 

10. Contributions of Phenomenology: Phenomenology contributes to human knowledge by offering insights into the nature of knowing, safeguarding the interpretation of scientific propositions against misleading philosophical arguments, and rescuing senses lost through inauthentic thinking. It enables knowledge extension beyond intuition while mitigating the risks of meaning depletion and inauthenticity inherent in advanced scientific investigation.


Title: Husserl, Phenomenology, and Foundationalism

This text explores the relationship between Edmund Husserl's phenomenological philosophy and epistemological foundationalism. 

1. **Husserl's Transcendental Phenomenology**: The paper begins by defining transcendental phenomenology, a method developed by Husserl to explore the essence of consciousness and experience. It focuses on the structures of experience (intentionality) rather than their content, which Husserl believed would reveal the necessary conditions for knowledge (Mohanty 1988).

2. **Foundationalism**: Foundationalism is a theory in epistemology that posits knowledge must rest on a foundation of noninferential justified beliefs or basic propositions (Fumerton, Alston, Steup, Klein, Audi, Howard-Snyder). These foundational beliefs are not derived from other beliefs.

3. **Husserl and Foundationalism**: Husserl's phenomenology is often seen as incompatible with traditional foundationalism due to its emphasis on the essential structures of experience rather than fixed foundations for knowledge (Drummond 1990, Zahavi 2003). 

4. **Husserl’s Critique of Cartesian Foundationalism**: Husserl rejects the idea that philosophy can secure objectivity by deducing it from a foundational ego cogito (Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology, 1970). His aim is to understand the conditions for knowledge, not to establish absolute certainty (Husserl [1936] 1970).

5. **Husserl’s Concept of Fulfillment**: Husserl introduces the concept of 'fulfillment' or 'intentional fullness', referring to the degree to which an act of consciousness grasps its intended object (Logical Investigations, 1900-1901). This isn't about certainty but rather about the richness or thoroughness of an experience. 

6. **Ontological Founding**: Husserl uses 'ontological founding' to describe how one kind of content depends on another for its possibility (Formal and Transcendental Logic, 1929). This relation is formal, not about certainty or indubitability.

7. **Husserl’s Critique of Internalism**: Husserl's position challenges internalist epistemologies, which require that justification for a belief must include reasons or evidence known to the subject (Goldman 2001). 

8. **Transcendental Foundationalism**: Some interpretations (Drummond 1991) propose 'transcendental foundationalism', where philosophical knowledge consists of criteria for legitimacy of experiences and principles for proper relations between different types of experience and knowledge. However, the author argues this isn't recognizably foundationalist.

In conclusion, while Husserl's phenomenology shares similarities with certain strains of epistemological foundationalism (like its focus on basic beliefs), it diverges significantly in its rejection of absolute certainty, indubitability, and internalism. The primary goal of Husserl's transcendental phenomenology is to elucidate the structures of experience necessary for knowledge, not to establish a foundational hierarchy of justified beliefs.


### 11-Introduction

The article, titled "Introduction" and authored by Matthew Ratcliffe and Shaun Gallagher, appears in Volume 16(3) of the International Journal of Philosophical Studies (2008). This piece serves as an overview for a special issue dedicated to understanding human experience and thought from a situated perspective.

The authors highlight the growing recognition in philosophical psychology and cognitive science that our perceptual and cognitive abilities are deeply intertwined with bodily activities and environmental features. This notion is supported by phenomenologists like Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, who emphasize the role of bodily capacities and interactions with social and technological environments in shaping our experiences and thoughts.

The articles within this special issue draw on diverse fields such as phenomenology, cognitive science, analytic philosophy of mind, and developmental psychology to explore the situatedness of human experience and thought. The authors aim to challenge popular assumptions about consciousness and provide complementary insights into this area.

The first two articles focus on reconceptualizing consciousness:

1. Mark Rowlands proposes an alternative account of consciousness as "revealing activity" instead of object-like, emphasizing its dependence on bodily capacities and activities without making the body itself an object of awareness.
2. Matthew Ratcliffe criticizes voyeuristic accounts of experience that impose a distinction between perception of an external world and one's internal bodily states. He argues, using phenomenology of touch, that all experiences involve a sense of relatedness between body and world, with no clear separation.

The subsequent papers tackle interpersonally and socially situated cognition:

1. Michael Wheeler uses Heidegger's "Being and Time" to present an innovative solution to the frame problem while responding to objections raised by Hubert Dreyfus.
2. Shaun Gallagher critiques minimal representation concepts, which authors like Rowlands and Wheeler adopt despite rejecting traditional representationalist approaches. Gallagher asserts that these minimal representations are not genuine 'representations.'
3. Peter Hobson emphasizes the importance of a developmental perspective in studying intersubjectivity, suggesting that thinking emerges from affective interactions between children and caregivers and is thus "interpersonally situated."
4. Beata Stawarska discusses indexical or deictic terms (e.g., 'I' and 'you') within a non-egocentric phenomenology of interpersonal situations, arguing that 'I' and 'you' are inseparable aspects of experiences.
5. Daniel Hutto proposes the "Narrative Practice Hypothesis," positing that our ability to attribute reasons for actions arises from common exposure to certain narratives and argues against an alternative view by Ratcliffe.
6. Maria Talero raises methodological issues in studying experiential workspaces, which are constituted by couplings between active bodies and practically significant environments. She stresses the dynamic, intersubjectively permeable nature of these spaces, arguing that scientific investigation might alter them due to their open structure.

The collection of papers is rooted in an August 2006 conference organized by the International Association for Phenomenology and Cognitive Sciences, with support from the British Academy and Durham University's Philosophy Department. The authors aim to foster interdisciplinary dialogue between phenomenologists and scientists to better understand human experience and thought.


### 11-Phenomenology and the Study of Human Occupation

The text discusses the potential of phenomenology as a methodological approach for studying human occupation within the field of Occupational Science. The authors, Anna Park Lala and Elizabeth Anne Kinsella, suggest that phenomenology offers valuable insights into understanding how everyday activities are lived and experienced. They argue that this philosophical approach can help elucidate the "delicate layerings" of occupation in people's lives by focusing on 'small experiences' and allowing these to speak.

Phenomenology, as a philosophy and methodology, has its roots in the work of Edmund Husserl, who initiated the phenomenological movement in response to what he perceived as a crisis in science during the early 20th century. Husserl sought to reorient scientific inquiry 'back to the things themselves' through rigorous philosophical methods that examine phenomena from the perspective of first-hand accounts and lived experiences.

Two key features of Husserl's phenomenological method are:

1. Phenomenological or transcendental reduction: This involves shifting from a natural attitude (day-to-day, taken-for-granted position) to a transcendental state. In this state, researchers suspend their preconceived notions and assumptions about the phenomenon under study through epoche', allowing them to approach the subject matter with fresh eyes.

2. Eidetic intuition/abstraction: This process involves identifying empirical universals or essences of a phenomenon by examining its qualities, attributes, and necessary features. Researchers consider similarities among instances of the same phenomenon and question their necessity to understand the structural eidos (form) of that phenomenon.

Husserl's phenomenological method is significant for studying human occupation because it encourages researchers to begin inquiry with fresh eyes, reconsidering taken-for-granted assumptions about everyday activities. This aligns well with the focus of Occupational Science on understanding contextual factors that impact how people engage in their daily lives and occupations.

The authors acknowledge variations among phenomenological interpretations over time but emphasize five core dimensions central to the tradition, including knowledge generation, intentionality and the lifeworld, Being, the lived body, and first critique. These dimensions reveal a complex methodology with potential to contribute valuable insights into the study of human occupation by examining how people experience their activities in everyday life.

In summary, phenomenology as a philosophical approach offers Occupational Science researchers an opportunity to investigate the lived experiences of human occupations more deeply. By engaging with Husserl's transcendental reduction and eidetic abstraction, practitioners can return 'back to the things themselves,' challenging preconceived notions and assumptions surrounding everyday activities, ultimately leading to a richer understanding of human occupation in people's lives.


The text discusses the significant contributions of Edmund Husserl's phenomenological perspective to understanding human occupation, as exemplified by two case studies. The first study, conducted by Finlay and Molano-Fisher (2008), investigates a profoundly deaf individual's lived experience following a cochlear implant. Through the phenomenological lens, the researchers uncovered that Molano-Fisher perceived hearing as an effortful act rather than an automatic process, which reframed her understanding of fatigue and its impact on occupational engagement.

The second case study, by Beagan and Saunders (2005), explores how young Canadian men construct their masculinity through both visible (active participation in workouts) and invisible (avoidance of 'feminine' activities or language) doing. This research demonstrated that phenomenological inquiry can reveal the symbolic significance of seemingly mundane, everyday activities, challenging conventional definitions of occupation as solely observable actions.

The text also explains two fundamental phenomenological concepts: intentionality and lifeworld. Intentionality refers to human consciousness being directed towards objects or experiences in the world, while the lifeworld is the background of meaning, time, space, and social relations that shape our everyday existence. These constructs emphasize that understanding human occupation cannot be limited to observable activities but must consider one's relationship with the world and the meanings embedded within it.

Intentionality and lifeworld have implications for research on human occupation. For example, Doyle's (2001) study of prisoners' experiences highlights how intentionality shapes meaning in restricted environments. Reed et al.'s (2010) work demonstrates that the call—intentionality and lifeworld meanings ascribed to others and things—can reveal the significance of occupations beyond their observable aspects.

Lastly, the text introduces two additional phenomenological dimensions: Being and the lived body. The notion of Being refers to the fundamental structure underlying human existence, often considered elusive due to its veiled nature beneath everyday manifestations. Phenomenological inquiry into Being can shed light on existential issues and systemic problems in occupational contexts (e.g., understanding occupational deprivation).

The lived body concept, introduced by Merleau-Ponty, emphasizes the importance of bodily experiences in human existence. By recognizing that we are our bodies rather than having them, phenomenological perspectives can reveal how embodied perceptions shape occupational engagement and meaning. Kielhofner's (1995) work on the body's role in occupation exemplifies this, as it uncovers dimensions such as living, intelligent, intentional, adaptive, and experienced aspects of the body during everyday activities.

In summary, phenomenological perspectives offer valuable insights into human occupation by considering intentionality, lifeworld, Being, and the lived body. These concepts challenge traditional definitions of occupation as solely observable actions, revealing the richness and complexity of human engagement in everyday activities through directed consciousness, embedded meanings, fundamental structures, and embodied perceptions.


The provided text is a scholarly article discussing the significance of phenomenology in occupational science, particularly focusing on its critical potential and unique approach to understanding human occupation. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Phenomenological Perspective in Occupational Science**: The authors emphasize that phenomenology offers a distinct perspective for studying human occupation. This perspective encompasses several key features:

   - **Knowledge Generation**: Phenomenology views knowledge generation as capturing the meaning of phenomena through first-hand accounts, which goes beyond mere observation or measurement.
   
   - **Human Intentionality and Lifeworld Perspectives**: It acknowledges human intentionality (the directedness of an agent toward something) and lifeworld perspectives (the world as experienced by individuals in their everyday lives).
   
   - **Centrality of Being**: Phenomenology considers 'Being' (the state or fact of living or existing) central to understanding human occupation. It explores how individuals engage with the world and experience it through their bodies.
   
   - **Primacy of the Body**: This perspective reorients attention towards the body as a primary medium for occupational engagement, moving beyond purely physical activities to include the embodied nature of existence.
   
   - **Critical Insights**: By examining first-hand accounts, phenomenology can reveal significant, critical insights about social, cultural, and political issues that might be overlooked otherwise.

2. **Critique in Phenomenological Research**: The article also highlights the critical dimension of phenomenology:

   - **Questioning Master Narratives and Dominant Discourses**: Phenomenological research challenges prevailing theories, normative perspectives, or 'master narratives' about occupation by critically examining first-hand accounts.
   
   - **Radical Reflection**: This involves bracketing (temporarily setting aside) assumptions about a phenomenon to reflect on culturally ascribed interpretations and examine the 'intentional threads' or taken-for-granted understandings that shape our perceptions of reality.

3. **Applications in Occupational Science**: The authors suggest that applying this phenomenological approach could lead to a more nuanced understanding of occupation, including:

   - Recognizing the transactional nature of occupation (how it's influenced by and shapes the world).
   - Understanding the role of Being and the embodied self in occupational engagement.
   - Exploring how everyday human activities can be 'noticed' through rigorous phenomenological methods, providing unique insights into social, cultural, and political issues related to occupation.

4. **Implications for Occupational Science**: The authors call for a reconsideration of the critical potentiality of phenomenological inquiry within occupational science. They argue that pluralistic approaches to knowledge generation are necessary, recognizing lifeworld perspectives as legitimate forms of knowledge alongside other methodologies. This shift could lead to richer understandings of human occupation and its complexities.

They contribute to a holistic perspective on human functioning and well-being within different contexts.


### 11-The phenomenology of attitudes and the salience of rational role and determination

Title: The Phenomenology of Attitudes and the Salience of Rational Role and Determination

Author: Fabian Dorsch

Journal: Philosophical Explorations, 2016

Summary:

Fabian Dorsch's paper discusses the phenomenological aspects of attitudes in thoughts and experiences, focusing on their rational role and determination. He argues for Phenomenal Rationalism, which posits that the phenomenal character of judgemental thoughts reflects their rational role—specifically, their capacity to respond to and provide reasons.

Key Points:

1. Neglected aspects: Despite recent debates in cognitive phenomenology focusing on content-related aspects, Dorsch argues that attitudinal aspects of thoughts are more significant and fundamental. They concern the general kind of thought or mental episode at issue, such as whether it is judgemental or imaginative.

2. Rational role: The rational role of mental episodes refers to their capacity to respond to reasons provided by other episodes or states, as well as their ability to provide reasons for others. For judgemental thoughts, this includes sensitivity (SENS), basing (BASE), and providing (PROV) epistemic reasons.

3. Phenomenal Rationalism: Dorsch defends the view that phenomenal character reﬂects rational role by arguing for the phenomenological salience of SENS and BASE in judgemental thoughts, as well as PROV. He presents a complex argument that we normally take our judgements to be reasonable, and this becomes manifest in forming higher-order judgements about their reasonableness.

4. Awareness Model: Dorsch endorses the Awareness Model, according to which our higher-order judgements are conceptual endorsements of a non-conceptual awareness of reasonableness. We judge our judgemental thoughts to be reasonable because we are phenomenally aware of them as such (and have no reason not to take this awareness at face value).

5. Perceptual experiences: Dorsch draws parallels between perceptual experiences and judgemental thoughts, demonstrating that the phenomenal character of both marks them as reasonable or responsive to epistemic reasons. This is due to their normal responsiveness to external objects, which makes their presentation seem fully determined by how things really are.

6. Implications: Dorsch's arguments support the claim that judgemental thoughts' phenomenal character reﬂects their rational role and determination, with implications for understanding the phenomenological salience of attitudinal aspects in thoughts and experiences. He also suggests extending his case to other mental episodes such as imaginative thoughts, episodic memories, pictorial experiences, and others.

Dorsch's paper contributes to cognitive phenomenology by emphasizing the importance of attitudinal aspects in thoughts and their reflection in phenomenal character. By arguing for Phenomenal Rationalism, he highlights how our judgements' normal responsiveness to reasons shapes their phenomenal experience, providing a foundation for understanding the interplay between rationality and conscious mental episodes.


The text discusses Phenomenal Rationalism, a theory that argues the phenomenological character of certain mental episodes reflects their rational role. The author focuses on judgemental thoughts (occurrent beliefs) but also extends the argument to perceptual experiences and other kinds of mental episodes.

1. **Rational Role of Judgemental Thoughts**: The rational role of judgemental thoughts is described by three aspects: (SENS) - sensitivity to reasons, (BASE) - basis in reasons, and (PROV) - provision of reasons for further beliefs or actions. These aspects are phenomenologically salient, meaning that our introspective awareness reveals them as part of the nature of judgemental thoughts.

2. **Sensitivity to Reasons (SENS)**: Judgemental thoughts are sensitive to reasons in the sense that they respond to those reasons by adopting a judgemental attitude towards their propositional content. This sensitivity is reflected phenomenologically as the thought's introspective appearance of being responsive to reasons for judging its content.

3. **Basis in Reasons (BASE)**: Judgemental thoughts are based on, or grounded in, reasons for believing their propositional content. This basis is reflected phenomenologically as the thought's introspective appearance of being determined by those reasons.

4. **Provision of Reasons for Further Belief (PROV)**: Judgemental thoughts provide reasons for further beliefs or actions. They do so by contributing to inferential chains leading from premises to conclusions, which are non-accidentally true and thus constitute knowledge. This provision is reflected phenomenologically as the thought's introspective appearance of providing sufficient epistemic reasons for forming further beliefs or taking certain actions.

5. **Extension to Perceptual Experiences**: The author argues that perceptual experiences also share the (PROV) aspect with judgemental thoughts, meaning they appear to be determined by aspects of the external world in a way that provides epistemic reasons for our beliefs about that world.

6. **Application to Other Mental Episodes**: The theory of Phenomenal Rationalism can be extended to various other mental episodes, such as imaginative thoughts and experiences. These may possess different rational roles due to their basis in practical rather than epistemic reasons, or in non-rational factors.

7. **Phenomenological Salience**: The phenomenological salience of a mental episode's rational role is linked to its introspective appearance as being determined by reasons (or external objects) and responsive to those determinants. This means that our introspective awareness of the reasons or objects shaping our mental episodes constitutes an essential aspect of their phenomenal character.

8. **Determination and Rational Role**: The author argues that differences in how distinct kinds of mental episodes are determined (by reasons, external objects, etc.) correlate with differences in their rational roles. For instance, perceptual experiences lack sensitivity to epistemic reasons due to being determined by external objects' features, whereas imaginative thoughts respond primarily to practical reasons.

9. **Introspection and Phenomenal Character**: Introspective awareness plays a crucial role in revealing the phenomenological aspects of mental episodes, such as their sensitivity to reasons or basis in those reasons. This introspective access enables us to form higher-order judgements and beliefs about our conscious mental states.

In summary, Phenomenal Rationalism posits that the phenomenological character of certain mental episodes reflects their rational role, as manifested in their sensitivity, basis, and provision of reasons for further beliefs or actions. This theory extends to various mental episodes, including perceptual experiences and imaginative thoughts, with differences in determination correlating with differences in rational roles. Introspective awareness is central to uncovering these phenomenological aspects of mental episodes.


Title: The Phenomenology of Attitudes - A Summary and Explanation by Fabian Dorsch

Fabian Dorsch's paper, "The Phenomenology of Attitudes," explores the nature of perceptual, mnemonic, and imaginative experiences from a phenomenological perspective. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Perceptual Experiences**: Dorsch posits that our perceptual experiences are intimately linked to their object-independent properties, which reveals the objects' role in determining these experiences. Perceptions seem to present us with an external world that is independent of our minds, and this gives rise to a sense of transparency - we are unaware of the process by which perceptual experiences represent the world.

2. **Imaginative Experiences**: Unlike perceptions, imaginative experiences don't automatically align with reality. Imagining involves mental agency, where thoughts or images are brought into focus and can be controlled. Dorsch argues that these experiences are transparent to their content but not necessarily to the world's nature or our reasons for holding them.

3. **Rational Determination**: Dorsch introduces the concept of 'rational determination,' which is a feature of both perceptual and imaginative experiences. It involves experiencing thoughts as having certain properties, such as reasonableness or truth-value, based on evidence and reasons. This rational determination can ground knowledge in perceptions but also, to some extent, in imagination (through higher-order judgments about non-accidental veridicality).

4. **Non-conceptual Awareness**: The paper discusses different models of awareness related to judgements: the Prompting Model and the Awareness Model. Dorsch suggests that some proponents of these models might accept a rational, non-constitutive link between lower- and higher-order states regarding reasonableness or truth-value.

5. **Practical vs Phenomenal Awareness**: McHugh's alternative version of the Awareness Model posits practical rather than phenomenal awareness in imaginative experiences. Dorsch critiques this for lacking clarity on how such practical awareness leads to theoretical higher-order judgments and accounts for differences between judgmental and imaginative thoughts/experiences.

6. **Misleading Phenomenal Awareness**: Dorsch, Williamson, Martin, and others argue that phenomenal awareness can be misleading. For instance, one might have a vivid perception of a non-existent object or believe a proposition on the basis of a compelling but false intuition.

7. **Non-conceptuality**: The paper also discusses the non-conceptual nature of certain forms of awareness, like Peacocke's view that some forms of rational awareness aren't conceptually articulated but are instead rational. 

In essence, Dorsch's work contributes to our understanding of how mental experiences (perceptions and imaginings) relate to the world and reasons, highlighting their phenomenological features like transparency and rational determination while critically engaging with various models of awareness.


### 12-Are Minimal Representations Still Representations_ 1

In his article "Are Minimal Representations Still Representations?" Shaun Gallagher critically examines the concept of minimal representations as proposed by Michael Wheeler and Andy Clark. Gallagher argues against their position, contending that minimal representations do not align with the definition of traditional representations, particularly in the context of action.

Traditional representation is characterized by internality, duration, external content, interpretation requirement, passivity, and decoupleability from its current context. However, Gallagher asserts that these characteristics are not applicable to actions themselves but rather to off-line cognitive processes such as imagination or memory.

Gallagher discusses the anti-representationalist views of Hubert Dreyfus and Berthoz & Petit, who argue that skillful intentional action does not require representational mental structures. They suggest that representation is associated with a failed Cartesian philosophy, which focuses on context-independent propositional knowledge rather than embodied, context-dependent knowing-how.

Wheeler introduces the concept of "action-oriented representations" (AORs), temporary egocentric motor maps of the environment tied to specific actions required by an agent. Gallagher critiques this notion by questioning what counts as an AOR and whether bodily movements can be considered representational.

Rowlands proposes a definition of representation in action, including characteristics such as carrying information about something other than itself, being teleological, capable of misrepresentation, combinable into general frameworks, and decoupleable from the represented entity. Gallagher then examines pre-intentional acts (deeds) as examples of representations in action, which involve on-line adjustments that support intentional actions without conscious control or awareness.

Gallagher challenges the notion of decoupleability in AORs and pre-intentional acts by arguing that detaching these elements from their original context and the represented object makes them fundamentally different from action components. He contends that the process of anticipation in motor control, as proposed by Clark & Grush's Minimal Robust Representations (MRR), is not genuinely decoupled from the ongoing environmental input and action itself.

Gallagher questions whether minimal representations, even if they are decoupleable, can still be considered representational in the context of action. He argues that the very idea of representation as decoupleable is question-begging since it presupposes a non-representational function. Furthermore, Gallagher supports non-representationalist accounts by referring to Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology and Wheeler's perception-based account of action, which do not rely on representations but rather on embodied skills, intuitive reactions, and continuous reciprocal causation.

In conclusion, Gallagher argues that minimal representations proposed by Wheeler and Clark are insufficient to capture the essence of representation in action. Instead, he recommends a non-representationalist account focusing on dynamic systems of self-organizing continuous reciprocal causation at the sub-personal level, along with a scientific pragmatism regarding the concept of representation.


The text is a philosophical discussion on the concept of representation in action, particularly focusing on minimal representations as proposed by some authors. The author critically examines whether these minimal representations still qualify as traditional notions of representation due to their departure from key characteristics typically associated with representations.

1. **Non-internal nature**: Minimal representations are argued to extend beyond internal neuronal processes, incorporating embodied and environmental aspects. They are not isolated within the brain but are distributed across the body and environment.

2. **Dynamic process**: Unlike static traditional representations, minimal representations are portrayed as dynamic, temporal processes rather than discrete entities. This stands in contrast to the usual view of representation as a stable, enduring entity.

3. **Pragmatic enactivity**: Minimal representations are not passive but actively contribute to the adaptability and organization of the system. They are integral to the process of action, not merely recording or storing information about the world.

4. **Non-decoupleability**: Traditional representations are often characterized by their decouplability—the ability to function independently from the environment in guiding behavior. Minimal representations, however, are continuously tracking or anticipating motor states, suggesting they remain tethered to ongoing environmental interactions and cannot be separated from these interactions.

5. **Weak instructionality**: While minimal representations can guide actions, they lack the strong instructional capacity characteristic of traditional representations. They do not provide comprehensive knowledge about the world in a manner that could solve problems like commonsense reasoning or the frame problem (the issue of how an agent's cognitive system determines which objects and properties are relevant to its current goals).

6. **Non-homuncular nature**: Unlike traditional representations, minimal representations do not involve hierarchical compartmentalization (a 'little person' within the brain) that interprets information independently from other parts of the system. Instead, they are part of a continuous, dynamic process without an isolated interpretational component.

The author suggests that these characteristics render minimal representations incompatible with classical conceptions of representation. Consequently, the term 'representation' may no longer be appropriate for describing the nature of action and its underlying mechanisms. The argument is made that actions can be better explained through a non-representational framework based on dynamic systems theory, emphasizing continuous reciprocal causation between brain, body, and environment.

The critique also touches upon potential misuses of representation concepts in cognitive science. It warns against attributing ontological status (actual existence) to representations, as this could lead to erroneous assumptions about the mind's functioning. The discussion concludes by distinguishing this argument from a mechanistic viewpoint or dismissal of consciousness' role in action, emphasizing that rejecting representationalism does not necessarily imply embracing determinism or epiphenomenalism.


### 12-Phenomenology and the Problems of Oral History

R. Kenneth Kirby's article "Phenomenology and the Problems of Oral History" explores how phenomenological philosophy can provide a framework to address challenges in oral history research, despite many practitioners not explicitly acknowledging this connection. 

1. **Subjectivity of Knowledge**: Phenomenology posits that all knowledge is subjective, as it stems from individual consciousness and perception. This perspective aligns with the inherent subjectivity of oral history, where memories and interpretations are influenced by personal experiences and biases. 

2. **Time Consciousness**: Phenomenology, particularly Husserl's ideas, highlights how individuals perceive time as a continuous flow from past to present. This concept is applicable in oral history when considering the evolving perspectives of informants over time and their changing interpretations of past events. 

3. **Openness to New Experience**: Phenomenology advocates for an open-minded approach, encouraging researchers to bracket preconceived notions and be receptive to novel insights from interviewees. This principle can help minimize interviewer bias by promoting genuine engagement with informants' narratives without imposing a specific agenda. 

4. **Intersubjectivity**: Phenomenology acknowledges that human understanding is both subjective and shaped by the subjectivity of others. In oral history, this concept underscores the importance of recognizing interviewees' perspectives as valid interpretations of their experiences, even if they differ from the researcher's expectations or assumptions. 

5. **Memory**: Phenomenology views memory as a complex, autonomous process influenced by various factors, making it inherently subjective and prone to variation across time and context. This perspective validates the unreliability of individual memories while emphasizing their significance in shaping personal narratives within oral history projects. 

Kirby argues that phenomenological principles can enhance oral history by fostering self-awareness among researchers, encouraging them to critically examine their own biases and assumptions. This heightened awareness can lead to more nuanced interpretations of interview data, ultimately enriching our understanding of the past through subjective human experiences. By embracing phenomenology's core tenets, oral historians can navigate challenges such as interviewer bias, informant unreliability, and questions surrounding historical truth while maintaining a commitment to rigorous methodological standards.


The text discusses the application of phenomenology, a philosophical approach emphasizing subjectivity and lived experience, to the field of oral history. Phenomenology encourages historians to acknowledge their assumptions and biases while conducting interviews and interpreting data, recognizing that complete objectivity is unattainable. The author outlines several guidelines for applying phenomenological principles in oral history:

1. Bracketing existing assumptions: Historians should bracket, or set aside, their preconceived notions about the topic of investigation during interviews to allow informants' perspectives to emerge naturally. This helps maintain an open mind and avoid leading questions until informants voluntarily bring up specific topics.

2. Avoiding leading questions: The historian should refrain from posing leading or suggestive questions, allowing the informant's narrative to unfold organically. However, once a topic is introduced by the informant, it may be appropriate for the interviewer to explore related aspects of that topic.

3. Exploring multiple perspectives: The historian should be attentive to various viewpoints and experiences within the data collected from different informants. This helps build a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

4. Emphasizing meaning over factual accuracy: While maintaining awareness of potential inaccuracies, phenomenology values the significance and value that emerges from informants' stories rather than strict factual correctness. Memories can be imprecise or jumbled, but their underlying themes and meanings provide crucial insights into people's experiences.

5. Recognizing limitations: Phenomenology acknowledges the inherent limits of historical knowledge and encourages historians to openly discuss these constraints with readers. By presenting gaps or ambiguities, phenomenological oral history invites others to participate in creating meaning, thus fostering ongoing dialogue about the topic.

6. Encouraging intersubjectivity: Phenomenology emphasizes that human experiences are shaped by both subjective perceptions and shared cultural frameworks. Thus, historians should aim to capture the interplay between individual viewpoints and broader sociocultural contexts in their interpretations of oral history data.

7. Valuing process as well as content: Phenomenology underscores that understanding not only what informants recall but also how they remember, perceive, and make sense of events is essential to gaining rich insights into past experiences. This approach acknowledges the significance of memory, storytelling, and narrative construction in shaping historical accounts.

By integrating phenomenological principles into oral history practices, historians can more effectively capture nuanced, context-rich perspectives that reveal deeper meanings about people's experiences and the world they inhabit. This approach emphasizes the value of open-mindedness, attentiveness to subjective experience, and appreciation for the complexities involved in constructing historical narratives based on personal recollections.


### 12-Re-expanding the phenomenology of hallucinations_ lessons from sixteenth-century Spain

The article by Simon R. Jones titled "Re-expanding the phenomenology of hallucinations: lessons from sixteenth-century Spain" explores an alternative perspective on understanding hallucinations by examining the writings of St John of the Cross and St Teresa of Avila, two sixteenth-century Spanish theologians. Jones argues that contemporary conceptions and models of hallucinations may influence our knowledge of their phenomenology, potentially overlooking certain aspects of these experiences.

To avoid this bias, Jones adopts a strategy inspired by Jacques Derrida's concept of "sous rature" (under erasure), where the term 'hallucination' is used with caution, acknowledging its limitations and inaccuracies when referring to historical experiences. He also emphasizes that this paper does not claim superiority or truth for these historical descriptions but rather aims to provide a different lens through which to view hallucinations.

St John of the Cross, in particular, offers a systematic analysis of supernatural communications (hallucinations) within his work "The Ascent of Mount Carmel." Jones focuses on St John's classification system, which divides supernatural knowledge into corporeal and spiritual categories, further subdivided into various types:

1. Supernatural ! Corporeal ! Outward bodily senses: Hallucinations involving visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile experiences of saints, angels, extraordinary lights, words, perfumes, sweetness, and touch sensations that are vivid, material, and can greatly stimulate the senses.

2. Supernatural ! Corporeal ! Inward bodily senses: More beautiful, perfect, subtle, and spiritual hallucinations compared to those experienced by outward bodily senses; these often involve deeper impressions on the soul and may include teachings or wisdom from God.

3. Supernatural! Spiritual! Distinct & special! Visions! Corporeal: Clearer and subtler visions of Heavenly and Earthly things, allowing the soul to see without hindrance; these experiences bring feelings of quiet, illumination, joy, purity, love, humility, and spiritual elevation.

4. Supernatural! Spiritual! Distinct & special! Visions! Incorporeal: Rare visions of incorporeal substances like angels, requiring a higher illumination (illumination of glory) to perceive; these are not of this life and can only be experienced occasionally and fleetingly.

5. Supernatural! Spiritual! Distinct & special! Revelations! Intellectual: Intuition of naked truths, inexpressible in words, concerning God or lower matters; these experiences provide deep insights but are rare, with individuals feeling well-rewarded for enduring life's trials to receive them.

6. Supernatural! Spiritual! Distinct & special! Revelations! Secret Mysteries: Knowledge of hidden aspects related to God (His essence) or God's works and Catholic faith, including information about individuals' lives, trials, and theological insights; St John does not provide detailed phenomenological descriptions for these experiences.

7. Supernatural! Spiritual! Distinct & special! Locutions! Successive: Hallucinations involving hearing voices or sounds without sensory intervention, occurring during meditation when the soul seems to reason with itself as if engaged in a conversation with another person, receiving answers, teachings, or guidance.

Jones concludes that analyzing these historical descriptions of hallucinations allows researchers to step outside contemporary paradigms and potentially uncover new aspects of the phenomenology, expanding our understanding beyond current models. The insights gained from such analyses can inform experimental design in hallucination research by "front-loading" phenomenological knowledge into study frameworks.


The paper explores the phenomenology of hallucinations as described by St John of the Cross, a 16th-century Spanish mystic, and compares them with contemporary research on auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). The author argues that studying historical accounts like those of St John can provide valuable insights into the modern understanding of AVHs.

Key phenomenological dimensions identified in St John's descriptions include:

1. **Exteriority-Interiority**: St John differentiated between hallucinations perceived to originate externally and those originating internally, a distinction parallel to Jaspers' concept of hallucinations proper vs pseudohallucinations. Contemporary research has found that 71% of voice-hearers report hearing voices only in their heads, while 18% hear them through their ears, and 11% experience both (Leudar et al., 1997). However, modern studies do not delve into the specific phenomenological differences between interior and exterior voices as St John did.

2. **Perfection, Vividness, and Beauty**: St John claimed that internal hallucinations could be more beautiful and perfect than external ones. Contemporary research has noted increased vividness during near-death experiences (NDEs), but this has not been systematically studied in relation to internally/externally located AVHs in clear consciousness.

3. **Illumination by Light**: St John described intense illumination and light associated with both corporeal and incorporeal "distinct and special visions." This phenomenon is also characteristic of NDEs, where individuals often report a bright, otherworldly light. However, this property has not been thoroughly examined in relation to AVHs in clear consciousness.

4. **In-or out-of-the-body**: St John noted that during certain experiences (incorporeal visions), individuals might be unaware whether they were in or out of their bodies. This facet of hallucinations has been studied in the context of out-of-body experiences, but not specifically linked to the unnatural illumination and light described by St John.

5. **Non-verbal information**: Intellectual visions, according to St John, are hard to put into words yet convey clear information. This characteristic is reminiscent of insights gained during NDEs, which are difficult for individuals to express verbally upon returning from the experience. Contemporary research has not explored this phenomenological aspect in detail.

6. **Voices that save**: St John identified a specific class of voices, "substantial locutions," which can bring great good and calm to the soul. These experiences remain understudied, with only scattered reports available, but seem triggered by specific circumstances, such as danger or threat.

The paper also discusses discernment criteria proposed by St John and St Teresa for distinguishing genuine supernatural communications from self-produced ones. These include aspects like clarity of phrasing, unexpectedness, content novelty, depth of meaning, and the accompanying emotions (e.g., peace, consolation).

In conclusion, studying historical accounts of hallucinations can offer valuable insights into contemporary AVH phenomenology. By comparing St John's descriptions with modern research, the paper highlights several under-researched aspects of AVHs that warrant further investigation, such as differences in the exteriority/interiority of voices, their perfection and beauty, associated light, non-verbal information transmission, and experiences similar to "voices that save."

### 12-The we and its many forms_ Kurt Stavenhagen_s contribution to social phenomenology

The article "The we and its many forms: Kurt Stavenhagen's contribution to social phenomenology" by Alessandro Salice explores Kurt Stavenhagen's underappreciated work on various forms of 'we' within the context of classical phenomenology. The paper begins by outlining the phenomenological distinction between mass, society, and community, emphasizing that individuals only share experiential moments in communities.

Stavenhagen conceptualizes experiential sharing as an interweaving of conscious experiences infused with a sense of 'us-ness'. He further elaborates on three main forms of communities: cohesive communities, communities of respect, and cultural nations or people (which Stavenhagen refers to as 'charismatic communities' and 'aidesmatic', respectively).

1. Cohesive Communities: These are groups united by mutual attraction or liking. The example given is friendships, fandoms, or romantic relationships. In such communities, individuals start to frame their experiences as shared, based on overlapping preferences and long-standing concerns shaping their mental lives. When an individual realizes that another shares similar fundamental values (concerns), they expect further overlap in preferences, which can lead to mutual liking and a sense of 'we'.

2. Communities of Respect: These communities are formed when individuals respect each other's perspectives or viewpoints. This form of community is less explored in Stavenhagen's work, but it's suggested that respect drives the self-understanding as group members and fosters a sense of 'we'.

3. Cultural Nations or People (Charismatic Communities): These are communities based on shared traditions, language, and self-representation. Stavenhagen argues against the biological or geographical determinants often associated with nationhood in favor of a cultural conception, emphasizing that these communities emerge from collective self-understanding and shared historical experiences.

The paper contends that Stavenhagen's social phenomenology significantly advances our understanding of how different kinds of 'we' emerge through preferences, respect, and certain emotions, thereby forming distinct forms of communities. Despite his extensive contributions to the field, Stavenhagen remains underappreciated in contemporary research on social phenomenology.


The text is an excerpt from a philosophical article that explores the social phenomenology of German philosopher Kurt Stavenhagen, focusing on his descriptions of communities and their formation. The author highlights three main types of communities proposed by Stavenhagen: cohesive communities, communities of respect, and cultural nations.

1. Cohesive Communities: These are groups that form around shared preferences for objects or values in the world. As members share these evaluative perspectives, they begin to value each other, ultimately leading to immediate communities where individuals also appreciate one another directly. This evolution occurs because mediate communities already contain elements of immediate ones—both involve a shared concern for aspects of the world, with the latter including an appreciation for fellow community members.

2. Communities of Respect: Stavenhagen defines respect as part of a family of recognition attitudes that includes trust and admiration. Unlike reliance or admiration, respect targets individuals as moral persons, focusing on their sense of commitment to obligations. Dispositional respect forms an image of how someone faces the world's moral obligations. When this image is frustrated by actions contrary to one's sense of commitment, respect may dissolve into contempt. If one’s sense of commitment motivates action on these obligations, dispositional respect can turn into actual respect with the intentional object shifting from the moral person to their actions.

3. Cultural Nations: Stavenhagen argues that national communities are spiritual entities requiring members to share a common perspective on the world. Unlike cohesive and respect communities, which form through shared evaluative encounters, cultural nations are inherited rather than discovered. Members grow into their communal perspective by inheriting an "emotional tradition" (Gefühlstradition) from their linguistic community, which shapes their emotional responses to values specific to that culture.

   The article suggests that individuals become members of a nation when they emote according to this emotional tradition, even without consciously recognizing themselves as part of the group. However, discovering one's membership in a cultural nation involves acquiring a "we-idea" (Wir-Idee), which is a vague representation of how one's community perceives itself. This we-idea makes transparent members' group affiliations by revealing that some experiences stem from their communal identities, thereby dissolving the opaqueness in their subjective lives.

The author also briefly discusses Stavenhagen's political philosophy, connecting his social phenomenology to conservative communitarianism while acknowledging that translating these ideas into a specific political stance requires further arguments not explored in the paper. The text concludes by identifying potential avenues for future research on Stavenhagen's thought, such as its relation to other philosophical strands (descriptive psychology, axiology, and theory of action) and connections with contemporary debates in social philosophy.

### 12-Thinking of oneself as the thinker_ the concept of self and the phenomenology of intellection

Marie Guillot's paper "Thinking of oneself as the thinker: the concept of self and the phenomenology of intellection" presents an alternative model for understanding the concept of self. Instead of viewing the indexical word "I" as an analogue to the concept of self, she argues that a better model can be found in phenomenal concepts or phenomenally grounded concepts.

The central claim is that the I-concept, which we use for introspection, self-criticism, deliberation, and action-planning, exhibits "super-reflexivity." This means it not only thinks of oneself but also thinks of oneself as the thinker of the present thought. Guillot refers to this familiar observation as the "Thinker Intuition."

Guillot critiques the indexical model, which posits that the I-concept is an analogue in the mental realm to linguistic expressions like 'I', 'now', 'here', or 'today'. She identifies several issues with this approach. Firstly, it raises modal difficulties: a description such as "being the thinker of this very thought" seems to be necessarily true for any individual using the concept, while the original indexical utterance is only contingently true. Secondly, the exclusivity requirement—the idea that self-conception is private and not equally accessible to others—is harder to account for in an indexical model.

Guillot then introduces her phenomenal model, which argues that the I-concept is a phenomenally grounded concept, anchored in a generic form of cognitive phenomenology: the phenomenology of intellection. This involves understanding the I-concept as partly constituted by one's experience of thinking itself—the "phenomenology of intellection."

The phenomenal model posits that, like other phenomenal concepts (e.g., 'red', 'sweet'), the I-concept has a phenomenal basis: in this case, the experience of intellection. This approach simplifies the indexical model by eliminating the need for complex token-reflexive descriptions and their associated issues.

Key advantages of this phenomenal model include its alignment with our intuitive understanding of the Thinker Intuition, its ability to explain the exclusivity of self-conception without positing additional mechanisms, and its avoidance of strong intellectualism—the idea that grasping the I-concept requires prior mastery of concepts like 'thinker' or 'thought'.

Potential objections to this view include concerns about whether the phenomenology of intellection could serve as a suitable reference for an individual (self) rather than a property. Guillot suggests responses to this, such as viewing the I-concept as a metonymic concept or exploring metaphysical accounts that picture the self as a property-like entity.

In summary, Marie Guillot's paper proposes a phenomenal model for understanding the concept of self, emphasizing the role of cognitive phenomenology in intellection as the core aspect anchoring our self-conception. This approach contrasts with traditional indexical models and offers a simpler, more intuitive explanation of the Thinker Intuition while addressing concerns about exclusivity and avoiding strong intellectualism.


The text presents a philosophical argument by Marie Guillot regarding the nature of the "I-concept" or self-concept, which is central to understanding how we refer to ourselves as thinking subjects. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Problem**: The I-concept is unique in its super-reflexivity—it identifies both relata (the thinker and thought) of the relation of representation as one and the same object, allowing us to think of ourselves as the thinkers of our thoughts. This intuition, known as the Thinker Intuition, has been challenging to explain using existing models like the Indexical Model or Phenomenal Concept Model.

2. **Proposed Solution - Phenomenal Model**: Guillot proposes a new approach that construes the I-concept as a phenomenally grounded concept, specifically a phenomenal-appearance concept. This concept is anchored in the phenomenology of intellection—the direct, present experience of thinking. By using this phenomenological basis, we refer to ourselves not as the thought itself but as its source or thinker.

3. **Key Points**:
   - **Thinker Intuition**: This model accounts for the Thinker Intuition by ensuring that when we use the I-concept, we are naturally drawn to think of our present thinking process and identify ourselves as its thinker.
   - **Phenomenal Appearance Concepts**: Unlike typical phenomenal concepts (e.g., "reddish"), which refer to experiences themselves, phenomenal appearance concepts can also refer to the cause or source of those experiences. Here, the I-concept refers to oneself as the source of present intellectual activity.
   - **Psychological Plausibility**: This approach avoids the strong intellectualism of the Indexical Model by requiring only that we be receptive to an experience (phenomenology of intellection) rather than grasping a complex description. It aligns with our cognitive abilities, suggesting it's psychologically plausible.
   - **Epistemic Exclusivity**: Since the I-concept is grounded in one's unique phenomenological experience, it's accessible only to the individual herself—explaining the intuition that only we can think of ourselves as ourselves using this concept.

4. **Objections and Responses**:
   - **Intellectualist Concern**: Guillot clarifies that her model doesn't claim thinking is essential to our selfhood; rather, it explains how we represent ourselves conceptually through this particular avenue.
   - **Predication of Non-Intellectual Attributes**: Despite the narrow phenomenological basis (thinking), the I-concept can be rich and diverse due to its role as a repository for various kinds of self-related information, linked through cognitive processes like multimodal binding in perception.
   - **Unconscious Self-Reference**: While thinking of oneself unconsciously might seem challenging under this model, Guillot argues that phenomenally grounded concepts can have derivative uses beyond the initial acquisition experience—akin to how standing or derived phenomenal concepts work.

5. **Conclusion**: This essay introduces and defends the Phenomenal Model as a promising way to understand the I-concept, particularly its super-reflexive nature. While further refinement and empirical investigation are needed, Guillot argues that this approach offers an economical, psychologically plausible account of self-referential thinking.


The text presented is an excerpt from a scholarly work discussing the concept of 'I', or self, as it pertains to philosophy and cognitive science. The author, Marie Guillot, argues that the traditional understanding of 'I' (the indexical model) may be insufficient in explaining certain aspects of self-awareness. Instead, she proposes a phenomenal model rooted in the subjective character or phenomenality of mental states.

1. **Traditional Indexical Model**: This model posits that 'I' refers to the thinker because it's used in thought and language as an indexical term, similar to "here" or "now". However, this doesn't fully account for why we are aware of this fact (self-awareness), nor does it explain exclusivity—why 'I' refers only to oneself.

2. **Token Reflexivity**: Guillot suggests that a syntactic item within thoughts could represent the larger representation (the thought itself) and thus secure simple reflexivity. But this wouldn't guarantee super-reflexivity, which includes self-awareness.

3. **Phenomenal Model**: To address these limitations, Guillot advocates for a phenomenal model. In this view, 'I' is grounded in the subjective character of conscious mental states. The idea is that our experience of thinking itself – the "intellection" – serves as the basis for forming a concept of self (the thinker).

   - **Phenomenal Appearance Concepts**: Guillot argues that concepts can be based on how things appear in consciousness, not just their physical properties. 'I' is such a concept—its phenomenal basis is the experience of thinking itself.
   
   - **Semantic Flexibility and Mis-reference**: This model allows for some flexibility in referring to objects or entities, but it doesn't face the problem of mis-reference in the same way as complex uses of 'I'. When thinking of oneself simply as "I", mis-reference is ruled out because there's no simultaneous reference under further representations.

4. **Historical Context and Related Ideas**: The phenomenal model is part of a broader family of approaches that emphasize the role of subjective experience in our concepts, including the work of Hector-Neri Castaneda and Tomis Kapitan. These ideas also resonate with thinkers like Brian Loar, Joseph Levine, David Pitt, Uriah Kriegel, Tim Bayne, Michelle Montague, and others mentioned in the references.

5. **Critique of Access Consciousness**: Guillot argues that relying solely on access consciousness—the availability of thoughts to introspection—is insufficient for securing exclusivity (self-referentiality) of 'I'. Others could potentially refer demonstratively to our occurrent thoughts using advanced brain scanning technology.

6. **Phenomenal Basis and Reference Rule**: According to Guillot, phenomenal appearance concepts need two things to be fully characterized: a mention of their phenomenal basis (what they look like in experience) and a reference rule—the condition an object must satisfy to count as the concept's referent. While the former is necessary for these concepts, it isn't sufficient; the latter (the reference rule) also plays a crucial role.

In summary, Marie Guillot presents a novel phenomenal model of the 'I' concept that aims to explain self-awareness and exclusivity by grounding 'I' in the subjective character or phenomenality of our mental states. This contrasts with traditional indexical models and offers an alternative perspective rooted in cognitive science and philosophy of mind.


### 13-Eichberg_s _Phenomenology_ of Sport_ A Phenomenal Confusion

Title: Eichberg's 'Phenomenology' of Sport: A Phenomenal Confusion by Irena Martínková and Jim Parry

Summary:

The article critically examines Henning Eichberg's approach to sports phenomenology, arguing that his method is idiosyncratic, problematic, and not genuinely phenomenological. The authors, Irena Martínková and Jim Parry, defend philosophical phenomenology against Eichberg's hostile review in the journal Sport, Ethics and Philosophy.

Key Points:

1. Philosophical Phenomenology vs Empirical Methodology: The authors distinguish between philosophical phenomenology (a descriptive philosophy focused on understanding human experience) and empirical methodologies that study concrete phenomena. Eichberg, according to the authors, confuses these two approaches by applying the term 'phenomenology' to his own empirical research.

2. Phenomenon as Experiencing: The authors argue that phenomenological phenomena are not concrete entities but are always correlated with human perceptions and experiences. They contend Eichberg misunderstands this fundamental aspect of phenomenology, as he focuses on the description of empirical, concrete phenomena rather than experiencing them from a first-person perspective.

3. Non-Abstract Phenomena: The authors assert that phenomenological phenomena are not abstract but are rooted in human experiencing. They criticize Eichberg for suggesting that phenomenology deals with concrete, independently existing phenomena without considering how they manifest to the subject.

4. Eichberg's Methodological Flaws: The authors argue that Eichberg's method is problematic because it starts with empirical data and descriptive storytelling instead of examining human experiencing. They contend his approach lacks a clear theoretical foundation, violating philosophical phenomenology's core principles.

5. Phenomenology as Method vs Content: The authors reject the notion that phenomenology is solely a method or content but argue it encompasses both aspects. They criticize Eichberg for failing to understand this and presenting an idiosyncratic, unsound review of the special issue under discussion.

6. Phenomenology as Alternative to Positivism: The authors assert that phenomenology is not merely an alternative to positivist reductionism but one among many approaches to understanding human beings and social action in the social sciences. They argue Eichberg's claim that phenomenology is the only viable alternative to positivism is false.

7. Avoiding Confusion: The authors stress the importance of clarity when using the term 'phenomenology.' They argue that applying this term without proper understanding or justification leads to confusion and self-disqualification as a non-phenomenologist.

In conclusion, Martínková and Parry critique Eichberg's approach to sports phenomenology, emphasizing the distinction between philosophical phenomenology and empirical methodologies, and arguing that his understanding of phenomenon as concrete entities rather than experiences leads him astray from genuine phenomenological inquiry.

### 13-Inference or interaction_ social cognition without precursors

Title: Inference or Interaction: Social Cognition Without Precursors by Shaun Gallagher

Shaun Gallagher's paper "Inference or Interaction: Social Cognition without Precursors" presents an alternative to the dominant theory of mind (ToM) models, specifically Theory Theory (TT) and Simulation Theory (ST), known as Interaction Theory (IT). This paper aims to demonstrate that primary and secondary intersubjective capacities found in infancy and early childhood should not be considered precursors to later-developing folk psychology or simulation routines. Instead, these capacities continue to operate as the ordinary and everyday basis for social cognition in adulthood.

Key points of Interaction Theory (IT):

1. IT challenges the basic suppositions of TT and ST:
   a. Mentalizing Supposition: IT rejects the idea that other minds are hidden away and inaccessible, arguing instead that knowing others' intentions, emotions, and dispositions is often simply a matter of perceiving their embodied behavior in context.
   b. Spectatorial Supposition: According to IT, our normal everyday stance toward other people is not an observational or detached one; it is second-person interaction based on projects, communicative practices, or predefined relations.
   c. Universality Supposition: IT denies the idea that mentalizing processes (theorizing or simulating) constitute our primary and pervasive way of understanding others. Instead, mentalizing is a specialized ability employed only in rare or specific circumstances.

2. Evidence for Interaction Theory:
   a. Primary Intersubjectivity: Developmental studies reveal that neonates have an embodied intersubjective perception, being able to pick out human faces and imitate gestures from early infancy (Meltzoff & Moore, 1977; Meltzoff & Moore, 1994). Newborns can even use facial gestures to provoke a response from others.
   b. Secondary Intersubjectivity: Around the age of one year, infants start recognizing context as significant (Trevarthen & Hubley, 1978; Hobson, 2002). This involves understanding others' actions based on both the agent's behavior and the causal constraints of the situation. Joint attention emerges as crucial in comprehending how surrounding context defines other people's actions.

3. Challenges to Theory of Mind (ToM) models:
   a. IT argues against ToM models' claim that everyday social cognition is a problem due to the lack of direct access to other minds, requiring special cognitive processes for inferring or simulating mental states in others. According to IT, perceiving embodied behavior in context often suffices for understanding others.

4. Enactive Perception:
   a. IT suggests that enactive perception (rather than implicit simulation) provides the best model for explaining intersubjective capacities. This means that our understanding of other people emerges from dynamic interactions with them, rather than relying on hidden mental states or simulated representations.

5. Critique of Implicit Simulation:
   a. Gallagher criticizes the idea that mirror neuron activation and subpersonal processes are forms of simulation, arguing instead that they constitute part of the neural basis for intersubjective perception. He suggests that these mechanisms underpin our capacity to interact with and understand others without needing to infer hidden mental states.

In summary, Shaun Gallagher's paper argues against traditional ToM models (TT and ST) by proposing Interaction Theory (IT). IT posits that primary and secondary intersubjective capacities found in infancy are not precursors to later-developed folk psychology or simulation routines. Instead, these capacities continue to operate as our everyday basis for social cognition. Enactive perception is suggested as a better model for explaining these capacities, emphasizing dynamic interaction and embodied understanding rather than inference to hidden mental states.

### 13-Normativity between Naturalism and Phenomenology

The article "Normativity between Naturalism and Phenomenology" by Thomas J. Spiegel discusses the ongoing debate between ontological naturalism and phenomenology regarding the reducibility of normativity to physical entities. The author aims to reconstruct a phenomenological argument that highlights the irreducibility of normativity, arguing that natural science, as the foundation of naturalization projects, is itself part of an essentially normative life-world.

1. **Naturalism and its Treatment of Normativity**: Ontological naturalists view normativity as a feature that needs to be naturalized since it isn't part of nature as such. They propose reduction, supervenience, or elimination approaches to naturalize normativity. The article focuses on reductive-based ontological naturalism – the idea that normative features are nothing over and above physical features.

2. **Support for Naturalization**: Ontological naturalists defend their position using two arguments:
   - Success Argument: Given the historical success of scientific enterprise, a commitment to ontological naturalism (relying on future-ideal physics) is justified. The assumption is that past successes indicate future progress in naturalizing normativity.
   - Miracle Argument: The best explanation for the explanatory power and success of science is that its theories refer to entities that truly exist, rather than being mere instrumentalist constructs. This argument asserts that any alternative would be "obviously mistaken."

3. **Phenomenological Critique**: Phenomenologists challenge ontological naturalism by arguing that normativity is irreducibly part of the life-world, which they view as more fundamental than science. This idea stems from the phenomenological tradition's emphasis on the irreducibility of first-person experience and experiential character.

4. **Life-World and Normativity**: The article reconstructs various formulations by key phenomenologists to illustrate that normativity is an extension of the irreducible first-person perspective within the life-world:
   - Husserl's Life-World: Described as a realm of self-evident givenness, providing the source of all justification, including scientific justification.
   - Schütz's World of Everyday Life (Alltagswelt): A "paramount" reality that subordinates other domains, such as science, in which people perceive, act, work, plan, worry, hope, and live their lives fully.

5. **Bootstrapping Problem**: By situating natural science within the life-world, phenomenologists argue that ontological naturalism faces a bootstrapping problem: if normativity is irreducible to the life-world, then reducing it via future-ideal physics would be self-defeating.

6. **Deep Disagreement**: The article posits that this stand-off stems from a disagreement about reduction's possibility, which turns on differing conceptions of science:
   - Perfectionist Model (ontological naturalism): Science provides an unmediated access to an objective reality independent of human experience.
   - Pragmatist Conception (phenomenology): Science is a human practice embedded within the life-world, with normativity as an inherent part of this context.

In summary, Spiegel's article presents a phenomenological argument that challenges ontological naturalism by demonstrating how science itself is normatively embedded within the life-world. This argument highlights the deep disagreement between these two philosophical traditions regarding the nature and possibility of reduction, emphasizing the importance of understanding differing conceptions of science in this context.


The paper delves into the philosophical debate surrounding normativity and ontological naturalism, focusing on the phenomenological perspective that the life-world is more fundamental than scientific inquiry. This argument is presented as a challenge to reductionist attempts by ontological naturalists to explain normative properties solely through non-normative, physical properties.

The central disagreement revolves around a controversial principle asserted by phenomenologists: If x presupposes y, then y cannot be reduced to x. In this context, 'x' refers to scientific theories or results, while 'y' denotes normative properties. This principle is crucial for understanding why phenomenologists argue that natural sciences cannot reduce normativity away since they themselves are steeped in it.

The argument unfolds as follows: 

1. The life-world (including first-person perspectives) is irreducible and sui generis.
2. The life-world is essentially normative.
3. Since science as an institution relies on the life-world for its existence, it follows that science itself is normative.
4. Scientific theories are normative because they presuppose normative properties.
5. Naturalization projects rely on scientific theories; hence, they also presuppose normativity.
6. The controversial principle then asserts that if something (in this case, scientific theories) presupposes another thing (normativity), the latter cannot be reduced to the former.
7. Consequently, naturalization projects, which aim to reduce normativity to non-normative properties, are inconsistent because they rely on results of science, which themselves are normative.

The paper posits that this disagreement is a deep disagreement—systematic, genuine, persistent, and reason-giving—between phenomenology and ontological naturalism regarding the reduction of normativity. 

A potential resolution to this impasse may lie in reframing the debate around different conceptions of science: a perfectionist model (embraced by some ontological naturalists) that sees science as an evolving project with a definite end-state of perfect knowledge, versus a pragmatist model (supported by phenomenologists and some pragmatists) that views science as an ongoing, open-ended process inextricably linked to normative human practices.

The shift from metaphysical reduction questions to empirical investigations of the nature of science could be beneficial. Such a reframing allows for methodological naturalism, which advocates for philosophy to follow the methods and standards of scientific investigation. This approach might encourage ontological naturalists, who often subscribe to methodological naturalism, to engage with evidence from scientific studies about science itself—a multidisciplinary endeavor that includes social sciences—to explore the nature of science further.

In conclusion, this paper argues for a re-evaluation of the reductionist stance in light of different scientific conceptions of science. By focusing on empirical investigations of the 'nature' of science, there might be progress in resolving the longstanding debate between phenomenology and ontological naturalism concerning normativity's reducibility.


The text presented appears to be a scholarly article or excerpt from an article written by Thomas J. Spiegel, discussing the relationship between naturalism (a philosophical position that asserts there is no non-natural or supernatural entities) and phenomenology (an approach to understanding human experience from the first-person perspective). The author explores the question of normativity—the study of normative claims, duties, and judgments—and its relation to these two philosophical traditions.

1. **The Discrepancy Between Naturalism and Phenomenology**: Spiegel identifies a central discrepancy between naturalism and phenomenology regarding normativity: whether it is reducible to physical properties (naturalistic view) or inherently tied to the life-world (phenomenological perspective).

2. **Two Conceptions of Science**: The crux of this debate, according to Spiegel, lies within differing conceptions of science:
   - Perfectionist View: This stance assumes that a future-ideal physics could potentially reduce normative properties to physical ones. In essence, it's the belief in a complete scientific understanding that could bridge this gap.
   - Pragmatist Conception: Here, normativity is seen as essential and operative from the start of the scientific process, making reduction impossible due to its intrinsic nature within science itself.

3. **Implications for Naturalism**: The author argues that, if we adopt a perfectionist view of science, ontological naturalists could theoretically escape the "normative swamp" of the life-world by showing how a perfect physics can reduce normative properties to physical ones. However, from a pragmatist perspective, normativity is inherently involved in scientific practice and thus cannot be reduced.

4. **The Role of Conceptions of Science**: Spiegel suggests that resolving the question of normativity's reducibility might depend on which conception of science one accepts. He proposes it would be more productive to investigate these different views rather than searching for refined physicalist accounts or merely asserting the primacy of life-world without further argument.

5. **Contribution to Dialogue**: By shifting the focus from normativity's reducibility to the right conception of science, Spiegel hopes to foster a dialogue between phenomenology and naturalism—two traditions that have historically been disjointed.

6. **References and Acknowledgements**: The article includes a list of references supporting its arguments, spanning authors like Elizabeth Anscombe, Robert Audi, John McDowell, and many others from the fields of philosophy, phenomenology, and naturalism. It also contains a disclosure statement affirming no potential conflicts of interest and an ORCID identifier for the author.

In conclusion, Spiegel's text probes into the complex relationship between scientific realism/idealism (in the form of different views on science) and philosophical stances like naturalism and phenomenology, particularly in relation to normativity. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these diverse conceptions of science as a path towards bridging apparent rifts between these philosophical traditions.


### 13-On the Full Concretion of Subjectivity in Husserl_s Phenomenology_ Contingency and the Transce

Mérédith Laferté-Coutu's article, "On the Full Concretion of Subjectivity in Husserl's Phenomenology: Contingency and the Transcendental Person," explores how Edmund Husserl's personalist ethics illuminates a new understanding of the transcendental ego's full concretion. The paper argues that contingency, a central aspect of human life associated with irrationality and facticity, is usually obscured by the phenomenological reduction, which brackets all matters of fact for theoretical inquiry.

Husserl's ethics introduces the notion of destiny as an unpredictable, immersive force that threatens rational human practice, including science and ethics. The challenge lies in understanding how to maintain commitments to values and ends amidst life's contingencies. Laferté-Coutu shows that Husserl's full concretion of the transcendental ego entails recognizing it as a person correlated to objects, the world, and an intersubjective field of meaning-formation—a personal practical world (personale Welt des Praxis). This personal ego is always dependent on its lived body.

Husserl distinguishes between rational motivations, like autonomous choices or active acts of remembrance, and irrational ones, such as passive associations or deep-seated desires. The contingency of destiny, however, transcends these categories since it is without motive and lacks spiritual genesis, rendering it incomprehensible from an ethical perspective.

Laferté-Coutu highlights the significance of Husserl's concept of absolute values—values that resist rational comprehension, are non-relative to changing circumstances, singular to the person who experiences them, and "call" individuals to responsibility for themselves, others, and their communities. The mother's love for her child exemplifies an absolute value, which endures even in the face of imminent world annihilation or despair due to unreasonable events like war and fascism.

Husserlian ethics, then, necessitates a personalist approach focusing on leading one's life as a whole, guided by the regulative idea of a true self (wahre Selbst) or best possible self. The notion of overview (Überschau) is crucial for grasping the entirety of one's life—past, present, and future—not as a sum of actualities but as a horizon of possibilities. This encompassing grasp enables an idea of oneself, structured around vocational commitments and personal style, and allows for self-determination amidst contingency.

In conclusion, Laferté-Coutu argues that Husserl's personalist ethics reveals the transcendental ego as a person who struggles against destiny's contingencies while maintaining rational commitments over time through an endless task of self-improvement and openness to renewal. This understanding moves away from bracketing factuality for theoretical inquiry, instead emphasizing the concrete meaning of subjectivity as personhood, immersed in a practical world with its inherent ethical strivings.


Title: The Transcendental Person and the Ethical Life: Husserl's Personalistic Ethics and Its Implications for Phenomenology

This paper explores Edmund Husserl's personalistic ethics and its implications for transcendental phenomenology, focusing on the concept of the "transcendental person." The central argument is that understanding the ego concretely as a person, specifically in terms of Husserl's notion of the transcendental person, is crucial to both ethical life and transcendental phenomenology.

1. Ethics and the Transcendental: Husserl's personalistic ethics reveals that the overarching goal of intentional life is practical rather than theoretical. The motivation behind this approach stems from Husserl's conviction that the world must make sense, and philosophy aims to provide rational justifications for our scientific culture despite its inherent irrationality.

2. Contingency and the Transcendental Person: Ethics highlights the significance of contingency in shaping personal life. The transcendental person is thus understood as a correlated subject who continually strives to realize self-realization, self-preservation, and self-determination amidst the unintelligibility and arbitrariness of the world. This perspective emphasizes that a person continues to pursue meaning and purpose despite facing incomprehensible challenges.

3. Motivation and Style: A personal style is central to understanding one's life as a whole, comprising motives, habitual behaviors, perceptions, judgments, valuations, and volitions. The transcendental person, with their unique style, accounts for the interrelatedness of theoretical, practical, and axiological intentions in personal life.

4. Phenomenology and Ethics: While ethics focuses on evaluating actuality within a given context, phenomenology grasps subjectivity more concretely. Transcendental phenomenology has ethical motives, such as securing the possibility of truth amidst contingency and elucidating the relationship between truth, values, ends, and concrete subjectivity.

5. Interdependence of Ethics and Phenomenology: Both ethics and phenomenology share parallel goals in understanding the ego concretely as a horizon of possibilities. The transcendental person is an ideal toward which phenomenology strives, providing a rational ground for evaluating actuality in personal and communal life.

In summary, this paper demonstrates that Husserl's personalistic ethics provides essential insights into understanding the transcendental ego concretely as a person – the "transcendental person." By examining contingency, motivation, style, and the interplay between ethics and phenomenology, it becomes clear that Husserl believes human beings have an ethical responsibility to grasp subjectivity in its fullest concreteness. This commitment not only enriches our understanding of personal life but also enables us to evaluate actuality within a broader motivational context, ultimately addressing the irrationality and unintelligibility of the world.


### 13-Rethinking Nature_ Phenomenology and a Non-reductionist Cognitive Science

Title: Rethinking Nature: Phenomenology and a Non-Reductionist Cognitive Science by Shaun Gallagher

Shaun Gallagher's article "Rethinking Nature: Phenomenology and a Non-Reductionist Cognitive Science" argues for the necessity of reevaluating the concept of nature in light of phenomenological insights to challenge reductionism in cognitive science. The primary objections to integrating phenomenology with cognitive science stem from two perspectives: (1) scientific concerns that phenomenology is ultimately reducible to neuroscientific explanations and (2) phenomenological arguments against the naturalization of subjectivity.

Gallagher contends that both positions misunderstand the relationship between phenomenology and science, particularly when considering a non-classic conception of nature. This alternative perspective includes subjectivity and intersubjectivity in scientific practice, aligning with Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics and Husserl's transcendental phenomenology.

In the first section, Gallagher discusses science and subjectivity, emphasizing that experimental scientists' activities and decisions are integral to their descriptions of nature. This non-classic conception of nature aligns with phenomenology by acknowledging its intersubjective roots. 

The second section delves into naturalism and reductionism, arguing that the classic scientific concept of nature as an objective totality separate from observers or perceivers is problematic for cognitive science due to quantum indeterminacy at the bottom and complex human behavior at the top. Reductionist programs, which seek to explain psychological phenomena through neuroscientific reduction, are challenged by this broader conception of nature, particularly when considering embodied cognition and affordances.

In the third section, Gallagher examines how phenomenology can contribute to an embodied cognitive science without succumbing to reductionism. Key concepts from enactivist phenomenological approaches include affordance (the relational structure between perceiver-agent and environment) and situation (constituted by organism-environment). These ideas reject the idea that behavior or cognition can be explained solely in terms of neural processes, as they emphasize the importance of situated agents interacting with their environments.

Finally, Gallagher discusses debates surrounding naturalizing phenomenology and highlights common misinterpretations, like those by Christopher Pollard, who argues that appropriating Merleau-Ponty's embodied phenomenology for cognitive science occludes its philosophical significance. Gallagher maintains that proper interpretations of phenomenological concepts, such as the intentional arc and body schema, can provide a nuanced understanding of nature without falling into reductionism.

In conclusion, Gallagher proposes a "meta-Copernican turn" in which we reevaluate our understanding of nature itself to challenge reductionist programs. By embracing a non-classic concept of nature that includes subjectivity and intersubjectivity, phenomenology can complement cognitive science without compromising its holistic vision of embodied agents interacting with their environments.


The text discusses the concept of a "transcendental turn" or "meta-Copernican revolution" in philosophy, particularly in relation to science. It suggests that this rethinking could involve shifting the understanding of nature from an objective, physical reality composed of separate objects, to a more relational and situational concept that includes perceiving agents interacting with their environment.

This shift is likened to a Copernican Revolution because it involves a fundamental change in perspective, similar to how Copernicus shifted our understanding from Earth-centered to sun-centered cosmology. However, unlike the original Copernican revolution, this meta-Copernican turn aims to provide firm foundations for scientific knowledge rather than displacing it.

The author raises questions about whether such a rethinking would fundamentally alter our practice of science as we know it today. Specifically, it might require a non-reductionist approach that focuses on holistic relations (such as brain-body-environment) instead of isolating parts for study.

The text explores several potential alternatives to scientific reductionism: acknowledging antinomies (like Kant's atomism vs holism), complementarity (such as Bohr's wave-particle dualism), postmodern pluralism, or emphasizing the primacy of the life-world (as per Husserl and Fjelland). 

Merleau-Ponty’s perspective is highlighted as advocating for a dynamical, multidimensional existence that necessitates a multidisciplinary approach. This implies disregarding individual disciplines in favor of the interconnectedness of various fields to better understand existence, which isn't confined to one single aspect (like neuroscience or psychology).

The text concludes by noting that while these ideas suggest changes in scientific practice and potentially a shift towards more holistic experimental approaches, the precise implications remain unclear. It raises questions about whether such shifts would indeed transform our current understanding and methods of scientific inquiry.


### 14-Cognition in Context_ Phenomenology_ Situated Robotics and the Frame Problem

The article "Cognition in Context: Phenomenology, Situated Robotics and the Frame Problem" by Michael Wheeler explores the frame problem within the context of cognitive science, artificial intelligence (AI), and phenomenology. The frame problem is defined as the challenge of explaining how non-magical systems (machines like humans) can think and act in ways that are adaptively sensitive to context-dependent relevance.

Wheeler begins by discussing the orthodox representationalist story (ORS), which posits that intelligent behavior is representation-guided, meaning that it involves building, storing, and manipulating internal representations. However, this approach faces difficulties in explaining how a system can determine what information is relevant in a given context.

The author then introduces the frame problem as a consequence of these representationalist assumptions. The frame problem has two main aspects: the intra-context frame problem, which deals with flexible and fluid action within a specific context, and the inter-context frame problem, which concerns adaptation to new contexts and indeterminate numbers of potential contexts.

Wheeler argues that Heideggerian phenomenology, particularly the concepts of thrownness (always being embedded in a context) and smooth coping (flexible sensitivity to context), can help resolve these issues. By recognizing that human agents are thrown into contexts where relevance is already determined, we can bypass the need for internal representations to specify contextual relevance.

However, Wheeler acknowledges that Heidegger's phenomenology alone does not fully address how to instantiate these properties in machines. To this end, he suggests a representation-shunning thrown machine that utilizes special-purpose adaptive couplings for intra-context sensitivity and continuous reciprocal causation for inter-context adaptability.

The author defends the idea that while continuous reciprocal causation conflicts with representational explanations, it can still involve representations within a specific agential phenomenology. Wheeler also addresses criticisms from Hubert Dreyfus, who argues that Wheeler's proposal is a cognitivist misreading of Heidegger due to its maintenance of a role for representation.

In summary, Wheeler presents an analysis of the frame problem by integrating insights from phenomenology (specifically, Heidegger) and situated robotics. This approach aims to bypass the representationalist assumptions central to ORS while still offering mechanisms for context-sensitivity in machines. The proposed solution involves special-purpose adaptive couplings for intra-context sensitivity and continuous reciprocal causation for inter-context adaptability, all within a representation-shunning thrown machine framework.


The passage discusses the frame problem in artificial intelligence (AI), a challenge that arises from the need for an AI system to consider all relevant factors when making decisions, particularly in context-sensitive situations. The author argues that traditional symbolic AI, known as Orthodox Rationalist Systems (ORS), fails to address this issue effectively due to its representation-building strategy, which runs into problems with contextual holism and infinite regress in assigning relevance to context-free representations.

Hubert Dreyfus, a critic of ORS, proposes a Heideggerian solution to the frame problem. This involves rejecting representationalism about intelligence, viewing human agents as "thrown" (embedded) in meaningful contexts, and arguing that contextual significance is not something to be added to context-independent primitives but is inherently present due to this embeddment.

However, the author asserts that while Dreyfus' analysis critiques ORS, it does not yet provide a complete solution from a cognitive science perspective. The issue lies in the lack of a mechanistic explanation for how "thrownness" could be realized in non-magical, computational systems. 

The author suggests that the concept of 'thrownness' can be understood within situated robotics, a field that shuns traditional internal world models and instead focuses on real-time integration of perception and action for adaptive behavior. Here, special-purpose adaptive couplings (SPACs) combine neural mechanisms, bodily factors, and environmental elements to generate contextually sensitive behavior without explicitly representing context.

The author presents the example of a female cricket's phonotaxis system as illustrative of this concept. The cricket's auditory system is tuned specifically to her mate's song, allowing her to track it without needing general-purpose reasoning or inference. This specificity implies that contextual relevance is inherently part of the adaptive mechanism rather than something to be constructed or represented.

The author acknowledges a potential criticism from Shaun Gallagher that conflates agential and subagential levels when discussing 'context'. However, he argues that using familiar terms like 'context' as explanatory concepts at the subagential level does not necessitate reductionism. Instead, it's about maintaining a real distinction between agential and subagential content while allowing for an intelligible mechanistic explanation of higher-level phenomena.

Lastly, the author refutes Dreyfus' call to abandon representations entirely. Instead, they propose 'taming' representations by reconfiguring them in a way that retains their subagential mechanistic mark of thrownness. They use examples from situated robotics, like Franceschini's obstacle-avoiding robot, which generates action-specific, egocentric representations tailored to the task at hand without needing explicit contextual representation. 

The author concludes by discussing two dimensions of the frame problem: intra-context (achieving flexible action within a given context) and inter-context (adapting to new contexts open-endedly). While acknowledging progress in solving the intra-context problem through SPACs, they identify the inter-context issue as an unresolved challenge. They suggest dynamical neural networks (GasNets), which feature complex dynamics and continuous reciprocal causation, might provide a solution to this broader frame problem by enabling significant adaptive plasticity.


The text is a philosophical discussion on cognitive science, specifically addressing the concept of 'Contextual Representational Causation' (CRC) and its relation to action-oriented representation and background coping in Heidegger's philosophy. The author, Michael Wheeler, engages with criticisms from Hubert Dreyfus regarding the frame problem and the role of representation in cognitive science.

Wheeler starts by introducing CRC as a non-representational process that may be the mechanistic basis for open-ended adaptation to new contexts. This implies that CRC can explain flexible context-switching, which is central to handling the inter-context frame problem. 

He then addresses Dreyfus' critique of his approach, which accuses him of propagating a 'cognitivist misreading of Heidegger'. Dreyfus argues that Wheeler fails to appreciate the ontological priority and phenomenological structure of background coping—a fundamental non-representational familiarity with one's world. This kind of coping, according to Dreyfus, underpins both smooth coping (or skill) and action-oriented representational problem solving.

Wheeler acknowledges that he previously overlooked the significance of background coping in his account. However, he maintains that CRC can explain this phenomenon. He points out that the causal processes underlying background coping, as described by neuroscientist Walter Freeman, align with the characteristics of CRC: multiple simultaneous interactions and complex dynamic feedback loops where each component's contribution partially determines and is determined by many others, and these contributions can change radically over time.

Wheeler asserts that both background coping and situated special-purpose adaptive coupling are structural preconditions for smooth coping and practical problem solving. He suggests that while CRC is the causal basis of fluid context-switching (inter-context frame problem), situated special-purpose adaptive couplings underpin intra-context sensitivity to relevance (intra-context frame problem). 

The author concludes by stating that he's not ambivalent about whether action-oriented representation or CRC is more basic; instead, he's uncertain if CRC or situated special-purpose adaptive coupling is ontologically more fundamental. He argues that background coping isn't a separate phenomenological module but a structural precondition for smoother and more problem-solving activities.

In essence, this text explores the interplay between different theoretical approaches in cognitive science—particularly focusing on the roles of non-representational (CRC) versus representational processes—and their implications for understanding human cognition and coping mechanisms within various contexts.


### 14-Edmund Husserl_s Phenomenology of Habituality and Habitus

Dermot Moran's article "Edmund Husserl's Phenomenology of Habituality and Habitus" delves into the concept of habit as understood by Edmund Husserl, a key figure in phenomenology. The paper aims to clarify Husserl's extensive and often overlooked contributions to the study of habit, which he viewed as integral to human psychic life.

Habit, for Husserl, is not limited to intellectualist or Cartesian interpretations but encompasses a broad range of individual, sub-personal, personal, social, and collective experiences. It plays a crucial role in the constitution of meaningfulness (Sinnhaftigkeit) and forms of sense (Sinnesgestalten) across various levels of human experience, from perceptual experiences to the formation of the ego, society, history, and tradition.

Moran begins by providing a brief historical overview of the concept of habit in philosophy, tracing its significance from ancient Greek and Roman thought through modern philosophers like Hume, James, and Bourdieu. He notes that despite its importance, Husserl's contribution to this area has been largely neglected by philosophers of mind and action.

The author then proceeds to disambiguate different conceptions of habitual behavior, distinguishing between instinctive reactions, learned skills, expert practices, and various forms of automatic or mechanical behavior. He argues that a nuanced phenomenological account of habit must acknowledge its diverse roles at both individual and collective levels.

Moran discusses the works of Merleau-Ponty and Alfred Schütz to illustrate how Husserl's ideas on habit have influenced other phenomenologists. Merleau-Ponty emphasizes habit as an embodied praxis, focusing on motor skills and bodily insertion in the world. In contrast, Schütz associates habit with typification, seeing our experience organized around identifiable empirical types shaped by association.

Central to Husserl's thought is his technical vocabulary for discussing habit, which includes terms such as Gewohnheit (habit), Habitus (disposition or bearing), and Habitualität (habituality). Moran highlights that while Husserl uses these terms sparingly in his published works during his lifetime, they are extensively developed in his unpublished manuscripts, revealed posthumously through the Husserliana edition.

In Husserl's phenomenology, habit is an essential aspect of individual identity, as each person has their unique habits (Jedes Individuum hat seine Gewohnheiten). These habits extend beyond mere behavior to include lasting decisions, values, and judgments that shape personal character. Habits are not limited to intellectual attitudes or convictions; they can also involve desire, feeling, or emotion, such as in the case of enduring love (dauerender Habitus).

Moran emphasizes that association plays a vital role in Husserl's understanding of habit. Association functions unnoticed in our comportment, driving us to connect similar experiences under similar circumstances. This passive genesis operates across various levels of psychic life, beginning with primitive desires and drives (Triebe) and extending to higher levels of conscious egoic involvement.

In summary, Husserl's phenomenology of habit recognizes the complex interplay between instinctual and learned behaviors, the role of association in shaping our experiences, and the profound impact habits have on personal identity formation. By acknowledging these diverse dimensions, Husserl offers a rich and nuanced understanding of human habituality that extends beyond mere reflex or repetition.


The provided text is an intricate exploration of Edmund Husserl's concept of habit (Habitus) as discussed in his works, particularly in 'Ideas II' and 'Experience and Judgment'. The author highlights how Husserl examines habit at various levels, from individual drives and instincts to societal traditions.

1. **Individual Level**: At the lowest level, similar circumstances evoke similar actions due to passive syntheses of association. Husserl calls this 'passive motivation', exemplified by habits like believing something once and tending to continue believing it (first law). These lower desires are not conscious acts but part of our 'living and striving' (leben und streben) for self-preservation. Husserl also discusses 'primary associations' happening in passivity, where external stimuli awaken experiences within the context of unnoticed familiar backgrounds.

2. **Social Level**: Husserl extends the concept of habituality to society, describing a 'social habituality' or 'tradition'. This is crucial for understanding Pierre Bourdieu's interpretation of habitus. For Bourdieu, habitus produces both individual and collective practices, acting as an anonymous, internalized system that stabilizes routines within a society. Habits are seen as 'internalized as second nature' and can be transmitted across generations.

3. **Normativity**: The text also discusses the role of normativity in Husserl's life-world concept. Critics like Jürgen Habermas argue that Husserl undervalues the normative aspects of the life-world, focusing more on the philosophy of consciousness. However, Husserl's concept of normality (Normalität) suggests a horizon of familiarity shaping our experience and understanding of objects. Everything encountered is 'normal' according to outlined pre-delineated expectations or intentions, forming an essential order for expected new experiences.

4. **Habit as Attitude**: Husserl views habit as the manner in which an overall attitude or stance (Einstellung) is lived through. This includes the 'natural' habit of daily living and the self-conscious phenomenological stance, with differences between them. Habits are seen as dispositions influencing interpretation, such as natural scientists interpreting everything as nature or investigators in human sciences viewing things as historical constructs.

5. **Habit and Natural World**: In a broader perspective, habit is also understood by Husserl as shaping the very manner in which nature appears. He describes causation in the natural world as having its 'universal causal style' (universale Kausalstil), indicating a regular pattern or typicality inherent in natural phenomena.

In conclusion, Husserl's concept of habitus is multifaceted, encompassing individual drives, societal traditions, normative aspects of the life-world, and even shaping our perception of nature. The author critiques misinterpretations of Husserl's philosophy by Bourdieu and Dreyfus, arguing that they overlook or misunderstand his nuanced accounts of habit and intentionality.


The text provided is a collection of notes or annotations on the works of Edmund Husserl, a key figure in the philosophical movement known as phenomenology. Phenomenology is a philosophical method that involves suspending judgment about the existence of the external world and focusing instead on the structures of consciousness or experience.

1. **Habit (Gewohnheit) in Husserl's Thought**: The notes emphasize the concept of 'habit' (or Gewohnheit) as significant in Husserl's philosophy, particularly in his later works. This isn't about personal habits or character traits but rather a more abstract notion.

   - **Scientific Habits**: Husserl discusses 'habits of natural scientific thinking' (Phen. Psych., § 5) and later, these habits are transferred to psychology (§ 24 IX 142). These scientific habits seem ingrained in the way we approach knowledge and understanding of the world.

   - **Phenomenological Habit**: Conversely, Husserl speaks positively about a 'phenomenological habit of inner freedom' (III/1 224). This suggests a habit that aligns with phenomenology's emphasis on intentionality and subjective experience.

2. **Ego as a Pole of Activities and Habitualities**: Husserl posits the ego (Ich) as not just active but also habitual, embodying certain possibilities or 'ich kann' (Phen. Psych., IX 136). This concept is further developed in 'Crisis', where he discusses the specific "activity and habituality of the functioning ego" (VI 109) and the peculiarities of human life tied to habits (VI 141n).

3. **Habitus in Sociology and Phenomenology**: The notes draw parallels between Husserl's concept of habitus and later sociological theories, particularly those of Pierre Bourdieu. Bourdieu's habitus is seen as a disposition or internalized set of practices that shape our perceptions and actions in society. This aligns with Husserl's view of the ego as a pole of acts and habitualities (Crisis, VI 187).

4. **Critique of Functionalism**: Jürgen Habermas' critique of 'functionalist reason' in his Theory of Communicative Action is referenced. This critique is relevant when considering how phenomenological concepts like habitus might offer alternatives to reductionist, functionalist views of human behavior and social structures.

5. **Philosophical Context**: The notes also touch on Husserl's engagement with other philosophers: his early distinction from Kant's schemas (Lohmar), his influence on Martin Heidegger's concept of 'das Man' in Being and Time, and his dialogue with the Enlightenment thought through Fania Oz-Salzberger.

The overarching theme is Husserl's exploration of the role of habit or disposition in shaping our experience and understanding of the world, contrasting scientific habits with phenomenological ones, and relating this to broader philosophical debates about subjectivity, social structures, and knowledge.


### 14-Husserl_s assistants_ Phenomenology reconstituted

The article "Husserl's assistants: Phenomenology reconstituted" by Gabriel R. Ricci explores the historical context and philosophical implications of Edmund Husserl's work on internal time consciousness, focusing on the role of his assistants in organizing and publishing these materials.

1. Edmund Husserl devoted significant attention to the analysis of internal time consciousness from the early 20th century. However, his various notes and lectures remained unorganized and unpublished until his capable assistants took on the responsibility of organizing them for publication.

2. Two primary assistants played crucial roles in this process: Edith Stein and Martin Heidegger. Roman Ingarden, another student of Husserl's from that era, also contributed to preserving Husserl's work on time consciousness.

3. Edith Stein, one of the first female assistants in the German academy, worked diligently to organize and edit Husserl's materials on internal time consciousness from 1916 to 1918. She produced a composite text from miscellaneous papers she was given, pledging herself to this task despite her dim prospects in the male-dominated institution.

4. Martin Heidegger, on the other hand, published an unfinished and largely unrefined text in 1928, which Husserl found lacking in quality. This publication occurred after Heidegger had gained notoriety with his own work Sein und Zeit (1927), which introduced a new philosophical vocabulary and analysis of time that owed a debt to Husserl's logical meditation on time.

5. The relationship between Husserl and Heidegger began to deteriorate in the 1920s, culminating in a public dispute over the publication of an article on phenomenology for the 14th edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Husserl criticized Heidegger's fabricated language and pseudo-scientific elements in Sein und Zeit, while Heidegger questioned the legitimacy of Husserl's stature as the reigning philosopher of phenomenology.

6. Both Stein and Ingarden appropriated Husserl's work on internal time consciousness, but they also challenged fundamental elements of his phenomenology. Stein discovered a psychic connection in Dilthey's idea of Einfuhlung, which was central to her dissertation, while Ingarden focused more on historical consciousness in his dissertation on Henri Bergson.

7. Husserl's manuscripts on internal time consciousness had been circulating among his students since the turn of the century. His 1905 lecture was well-known to them, and Heidegger later published an unfinished version in the Jahrbuch fu¨r Philosophie und pha¨nomenologische Forschung, which Husserl had founded with a group of early phenomenology enthusiasts in 1913.

8. The Jahrbuch was an unusual periodical that published substantial works by Husserl's followers and students, including Ingarden's dissertation on Henri Bergson and Stein's anticipated Habilitationschrift, Contributions to the Philosophical Foundation of Psychology and the Human Studies. Heidegger published a work on Aristotle that anticipated Sein und Zeit in volume VIII, and volume VIII contained the first half of what would become the manuscript Sein und Zeit in 1925.

9. Husserl's relationship with his students and protégés had mixed results: while some, like Ingarden, produced substantial works that contributed to the field of phenomenology, others, like Heidegger, would eventually turn against their mentor's methodology and embrace a more ontological orientation in their philosophical endeavors.

10. The article highlights how the historical context of early 20th-century European intellectual life, marked by shifting political ideologies and philosophical debates, influenced the redaction and publication of Husserl's writings on internal time consciousness


The text discusses the philosophical interpretations of time by three major figures: Augustine, Husserl, Heidegger, and Edith Stein's influence on them. 

1. **Augustine**: His meditation on time, detailed in "Confessions," has been a foundational text for understanding the nature of time. Augustine used auditory analogies (like a noise, a spoken phrase, or a psalm) to conceptualize how time is measured as it passes. He focused on the transition from moments of expectation, memory, and attention during an utterance, suggesting that these moments are absorbed into a totality comprising all facets of time. This meditation emphasizes the mind's interior attentiveness in collapsing the chimerical nature of past, future, and present into a unified experience.

2. **Husserl**: A nineteenth-century experimental psychologist and phenomenologist, Husserl was influenced by Augustine's ideas. He too used auditory analogies to explain time measurement, progressing from simple sounds to complex utterances like "Deus Creator Omnium" or psalms. Husserl was interested in how moments of expectation, memory, and attention during an utterance transition into a unified experience of time. Edith Stein, his assistant, organized his random papers into coherent texts, including those on internal time consciousness. Despite criticisms from Henri Dussort about altering Husserl's thought, Ingarden defended Stein's work, highlighting her role as an editor and her diligence in organizing Husserl's manuscripts despite his inattentiveness to detail.

3. **Edith Stein**: A student of Husserl, Stein significantly influenced phenomenology by emphasizing the embodied nature of consciousness and challenging Husserl's pure epistemological ego. Her dissertation, which remained on Husserl's windowsill, utilized his phenomenological treatment of time to illustrate the mechanism of empathy. Stein argued that the pure 'I' in phenomenology should be connected and continuous with other egos for a complete epistemological self. This approach contrasted with Husserl's insistence on bracketing off the external world. Stein's essay on empathy, published posthumously, combined praise for her mentor and critique of prominent figures like Ranke, Burckhardt, and Dilthey, proposing a temporal framework involving a stream of consciousness to explain how non-immediate experiences become part of consciousness.

4. **Heidegger**: Heidegger's "Sein und Zeit" (Being and Time) built on Husserl's phenomenology, emphasizing temporality as fundamental to human existence. Unlike Kant, who viewed time as an a priori temporal intuition, Husserl found the unity of consciousness in temporality via triadic intentionality. This involved retention (past), perception (present), and protection (future). Heidegger, in contrast, saw existence itself as fundamentally temporal, introducing Dasein—a being always ahead of itself, thrown into a world it is concerned with. Death, for Heidegger, was intrinsically linked to this temporality, embodying the ultimate possibility and authenticity of human existence.

5. **Gadamer**: Building on his predecessors, Gadamer applied their temporal horizon concepts to hermeneutics in "Truth and Method." He recognized that time doesn't produce gaps requiring connections but is a continuous tradition of positive forms of prejudice. Within this framework, understanding involves the fusion of historical horizons, illuminating the unity behind every hermeneutic situation, rather than merely connecting isolated temporal perspectives. Gadamer's productive hermeneutics surpassed mere reconstruction and historicist empathic mechanisms.

The text concludes by discussing Max Scheler, an influential figure in phenomenology who had disagreements with Husserl but shared a similar philosophical anthropology from different perspectives. His work attracted the attention of Catholic intellectuals like Edith Stein and later Pope John Paul II, though it was suppressed by Nazis due to Scheler's Jewish heritage near the end of his life.


The text discusses the philosophical critique by Max Scheler on Martin Heidegger's concept of "Care" as presented in his seminal work, "Being and Time." 

Heidegger posits that Care is a fundamental ontological characteristic of human existence (Dasein), predisposing us to engage with the world. This Care equips Dasein with an innate disposition or Urbefindlichkeit through which the world becomes revealed, without requiring external stimuli for its activation. Heidegger draws parallels between this state and what Scheler recognizes as dread or anxiety from Kierkegaard's philosophy. This emotional a priori, according to Heidegger, underpins authentic potentiality and individuality, setting individuals apart from conformist group mentality.

Scheler, however, questions the universality of Heidegger's depiction of Care and dread. While acknowledging Heidegger's intellectual debts to Kierkegaard and Pascal, Scheler contends that Heidegger hasn't adequately elucidated the ontological significance of Care and anxiety within various cultural contexts or stages of human development. Scheler suggests these emotive dispositions might not be universally applicable, arguing they could also explain how ancient peoples perceived their world without necessarily implying Heidegger's specific interpretations.

Scheler proposed that a more appropriate emotion to encapsulate the temporal nucleus of Care, as Heidegger defines it, would be hope rather than dread. Hope, according to Scheler, better aligns with Heidegger's concept of being-ahead-of-itself-already-in-a-world.

Heidegger's interpretation of Care, rooted in death anxiety and existential apprehension about being-in-the-world, is central to his philosophy. Despite the complexities surrounding anxiety—which, according to Heidegger, isn't just about fear of ending but also a feeling of alienation or unheimlichkeit from one's world—Scheler's critique implies that such a focus on death and existential dread may lead to a pessimistic outlook incompatible with certain philosophical traditions valuing hope and progress.

The debate between Scheler and Heidegger highlights the diverse interpretations possible in phenomenology, particularly concerning the emotional foundations of human existence and consciousness. While both philosophers agree on the ontological importance of emotional predispositions, they differ fundamentally in their choice of specific emotions to describe the essence of human being-in-the-world.


### 14-Pyrrhonian Scepticism_ A Therapeutic Phenomenology

The article by John M. Heaton, titled "Pyrrhonian Scepticism: A Therapeutic Phenomenology," explores the ancient Greek philosophy of Pyrrhonian scepticism, emphasizing its therapeutic nature and comparing it with phenomenology and Wittgenstein's thought. Heaton provides a historical overview of Pyrrhonian scepticism and distinguishes it from modern scepticism, which focuses on undermining evidence for knowledge claims.

Pyrrhonian scepticism, founded by Pyrrho of Elis (c.360-c.206 B.C.), centers around the idea that conflict or confusion is a significant source of human unhappiness. The sceptic aims to alleviate this misery through suspension of judgement (epoche), which allows for tranquility in the face of contradictory impressions and beliefs. This approach was also shared by Eastern philosophies, like Zen Buddhism and Tibetan Dzogchen school.

Sextus Empiricus, a practicing physician from around 200 A.D., is the principal source for Pyrrhonian scepticism in this article. He defines scepticism as an ability to set up oppositions among appearances and thoughts, leading to epoche (suspension of judgement) and subsequent tranquility. Sceptics question various conflicting accounts in the world without adhering to a specific procedure or methodology.

The epoche is crucial for Pyrrhonian scepticism as it helps suspend judgement by recognizing equipollence (balance) among contradictory arguments, resulting in tranquility. Unlike Husserl's phenomenology, where the epoche is a procedure to achieve a transformed state of consciousness, Pyrrhonian scepticism sees it as an ability or know-how rather than a technique or method.

The sceptics avoid dogmatic assertions and instead use avowals (apangelia) that imply no belief about the nature of reality. Their utterances are self-cancelling, not intended to prove anything but merely to demonstrate what can be argued against foundational dogmas. Sceptical arguments do not provide disproof but serve as reminders of potential contradictions within dogmatic claims.

Pyrrhonian scepticism rejects systematic goals and life philosophies, believing they are sources of disturbance. Instead, it encourages living according to appearances guided by nature's impulses without attachment to beliefs or concepts. The sceptic practices various arts and sciences while remaining unaffected by dogmatic convictions about the "nature" of things.

Heaton highlights that Pyrrhonian scepticism is not a therapy with a specific set of instructions for attaining tranquility but rather an approach to life characterized by a basic disposition of wondering, or unanxious questioning. The ultimate aim is not peace and tranquility but self-awareness and helping others if they are in conflict.

In conclusion, Heaton's article sheds light on Pyrrhonian scepticism as a unique therapeutic philosophy emphasizing the recognition and suspension of judgment amidst conflicting impressions and beliefs to achieve tranquility. This ancient approach finds relevance in contemporary psychotherapy, with its focus on self-awareness and unattached perception.


This text is a philosophical exploration of Pyrrhonian Skepticism, an ancient Greek school of thought, and its relevance to contemporary psychotherapy, particularly contrasting it with the theories of Sigmund Freud. 

1. **Skeptical View on Good/Evil**: The skeptic, according to this text, is not apathetic towards all values; instead, they have a nuanced perspective. They recognize the self-controlled sage's commitment to what they perceive as 'supremely good,' but they argue that this is essentially an expression of their own desires, leading to dogmatic beliefs and potential conflict if these goals aren't met. 

2. **Epoche and Ataraxia**: A key concept in Pyrrhonian Skepticism is 'epoche' - the suspension of judgment or withholding assent from claims we cannot definitively know. When one achieves a clear understanding (Ubersicht) of the interplay between desire, expectation, recognition, etc., they can attain 'ataraxia' or tranquility. This tranquility is not something willed; it's a state achieved through recognizing the inherent uncertainty of our judgments.

3. **Critique of Stoic Desire and Action**: The text critiques the Stoics’ view on desire and action, arguing that their normative questions (e.g., "Is it right for me to eat the apple?") are dogmatic. Skeptics, in contrast, act based on what 'appears appropriate' without forming definitive propositions or dogmas.

4. **Wittgenstein's Relevance**: The text references Ludwig Wittgenstein’s views on propositions and their relationship to states of affairs. It suggests that propositions aren't direct representations of reality but are linguistic tools we use in our grammar, and thus don't exclusively guide action.

5. **Skepticism vs. Psychotherapy**: The text then turns to psychotherapy, arguing that many contemporary practices resemble dogmatic belief systems more than skeptical inquiry. It criticizes the instructive style of modern psychotherapists who often present their views as unquestionable truths, akin to the self-controlled sage's dogma.

6. **Freudian Critique**: The author specifically critiques Freud’s theory of the super-ego and his use of word presentations between thought and action, suggesting that Freud lacks a satisfactory account of thoughtful action. 

7. **Skeptical Therapy Approach**: Unlike dogmatic therapies that aim to replace irrational desires with rational ones, skeptical therapy questions all beliefs, including those of the therapist. It uses self-refuting arguments tailored to the individual's specific beliefs and does not diagnose underlying conditions or structures causing mental conflict, unlike psychoanalysis.

8. **Conclusion**: The text concludes by reiterating skepticism as a philosophy of inquiry rather than seeking definitive answers, emphasizing its focus on dissolving arrogance and misunderstanding of time through attention to linguistic practices and their contexts. It suggests that true understanding comes from accepting, not explaining away, the multiplicity and unpredictability of life's experiences.

The author's broader aim seems to be arguing for a more humble, context-sensitive approach to psychotherapy - one that questions its own premises rather than presenting itself as an objective, scientific truth.


### 14-The _in_visibility of others_ a reply to Herschbach

Title: "The (in)visibility of others: A reply to Herschbach" by Dan Zahavi and Shaun Gallagher

In this article, Zahavi and Gallagher respond to Mitchell Herschbach's critique of their phenomenological approach to intersubjectivity in the context of social perception. They agree with Herschbach on some points, such as distinguishing personal and sub-personal accounts of social cognition and acknowledging that our conscious recognition of emotional expressions is supported by various sub-personal mechanisms. However, they argue that Herschbach has missed crucial aspects of their argumentation in criticizing the phenomenological approach.

1. Theory Theory:
   - Zahavi's critique of theory theory is at the personal level, contending that this account considers mental states unobservable and theoretically postulated entities. He argues that this view ignores experiential access to others' minds in their expressive behavior and meaningful action. Herschbach, while acknowledging Zahavi's concern about promiscuity (trivialization of the concept of theory), fails to recognize that Zahavi also addresses the specific aspects of unobservable mental entities and theoretical postulations in his critique.
- The authors suggest that, even if a sub-personal version of theory theory could accommodate direct experience of 'expressive behavior,' it still doesn't solve the core issue: whether there's any aspect of others' minds directly accessible to consciousness. They claim Herschbach endorses an unusual view by maintaining that the explanatory power of sub-personal theory can remain unchanged despite this radical change in the explandum (the phenomenon to be explained).

2. Simulation Theory:
   - Gallagher's critique of simulation theory focuses on its sub-personal version, particularly implicit simulation theory, which involves both instrumental control via use of a model and pretense. Herschbach argues that the brain mechanisms do not employ models or representations in the same way persons understand external representations, but one can still speak of such an instrumental aspect at the sub-personal level.
   - Zahavi and Gallagher respond by pointing out that the kind of pretense required for simulation theory (identifying oneself with another person's state) is difficult to apply on a sub-personal level. They argue that the neuronal systems involved do not take initiative, but are automatically activated by others' actions. Herschbach counters by suggesting a minimal concept of simulation without pretense, where matching states between target and attributor are sufficient for simulation.
   - Zahavi and Gallagher contend that this minimal definition still faces challenges in defining 'matching states' neurally, as brain functions involve neuronal assemblies built with temporal constraints (synchrony of action potentials). They argue that slight delays or variations may lead to different assemblies and functions. Furthermore, evidence from mirror neuron studies suggests that there's no precise match between motor system execution and observed actions, making the notion of simulation unclear when applied to sub-personal processes.

In conclusion, Zahavi and Gallagher advocate for a second-person approach to interpersonal understanding, which emphasizes interaction, context, and narrative rather than accommodating social cognition through theory theory or simulation theory, both of which maintain that social cognition is primarily a matter of inferring invisible minds.


### 15-Phenomenology and De Re Interpretation_ A Critique of Brandom_s Reading of Hegel

In "Phenomenology and De Re Interpretation: A Critique of Brandom's Reading of Hegel," Stephen Houlgate critiques Robert Brandom's interpretation of G.W.F. Hegel in Tales of the Mighty Dead. The crux of Houlgate's argument lies in the distinction between de dicto and de re interpretation, a methodological approach Brandom employs to understand philosophical texts.

1. **De Dicto vs De Re Interpretation**: De dicto interpretation seeks to establish what the author herself would say about the claims made in the text, given her commitments. In contrast, de re interpretation aims to determine what follows from those claims in truth, within the context of the interpreter's own beliefs.

2. **Brandom's De Re Interpretation**: Brandom employs a de re approach to Hegel's Phenomenology, interpreting it through his own commitments and logical principles (like reference dependence and sense dependence). This method, according to Houlgate, fails to capture the essence of Hegel's phenomenological conception.

3. **Hegel's Phenomenology**: For Hegel, phenomenology is a rigorous study of consciousness that aims to determine what follows from its claims within the experience of consciousness itself, without external criteria or commitments. This approach involves setting aside one’s own commitments and understanding the necessities for consciousness as it encounters objects.

4. **Brandom's Misinterpretation**: Houlgate argues that Brandom's de re interpretation neglects Hegel's distinctive phenomenological method, leading to a distorted view of Hegel’s thought. Key misunderstandings include:

   - **Unity and Difference**: Brandom fails to recognize the central role of unity in differences for Hegel's perception, which acknowledges both compatibility (indifferent difference) and exclusivity (material incompatibility) between properties.
   - **Sense Certainty and Perception**: Brandom overlooks the phenomenological progression from sense certainty to perception, where objects are understood as unified plurals—a unity of differences—rather than focusing solely on determinacy or exclusion.

5. **Consequences for Hegel's Thought**: By not accounting for Hegel’s phenomenological method, Brandom's interpretation misses critical aspects of Hegel’s conception of the world and its determinacy. This critique underscores the importance of understanding philosophical texts within their original methodological frameworks to accurately represent their ideas.

Houlgate's argument highlights the significance of interpreting philosophical works, like Hegel's Phenomenology, according to their intended methods (phenomenological in this case) rather than imposing external interpretive frameworks, such as de re interpretation. By doing so, we can better appreciate and understand the nuances and depth of a philosopher's thought.


This text is a philosophical analysis comparing the views of G.W.F. Hegel with those of contemporary philosopher Robert Brandom, particularly focusing on their interpretations of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. The author argues that Brandom misinterprets or oversimplifies Hegel's complex phenomenological method and his views on perception, understanding, and the nature of reality.

1. Perception and Understanding: The text explains that according to Hegel, perception initially attributes different aspects of an object to either the thing itself or the perceiving subject. This leads to a need for correction to maintain self-identity while acknowledging the object's features. Contradictions are first attributed to perception but later understood as inherent within the object, which is divided between its relation to others and its intrinsic distinctness.

2. The Problem of Self-Contradiction: Perception encounters a problem where the thing's determinacy or 'absolute character' that gives it independence simultaneously undermines it by placing it in relation to other things. This contradiction cannot be resolved, and Hegel argues that it is part of the true nature of the object.

3. Comparison with Brandom: The author contends that Brandom's problem of a world of pure relations without relata differs from Hegel's issue. For Brandom, intelligibility is restored by understanding relations between properties with their own immediacy; for Hegel, the object proves to be irreducibly self-contradictory because its determinacy both gives it independence and places it in relation to other things, which ultimately undermines that independence.

4. The Transition from Consciousness to Self-Consciousness: Hegel posits that understanding recognizes the world's inner being as objective. Through explanation, understanding reflects its activity back onto itself as truth and uncovers contradictions within reality. This leads to self-consciousness when consciousness encounters its object explicitly as infinity—a movement of self-cancellation or negation that it recognizes in itself.

5. Objective Idealism: The author challenges Brandom's claim that Hegel endorses objective idealism, a view stating one cannot understand the world determinately without considering the subjective process of acknowledging and removing errors. According to this analysis, understanding does not comprehend its object by reflecting on its own activity but recognizes the object as independently exhibiting contradictory unity.

6. Hegel's Phenomenology vs. Brandomian Interpretation: The text argues that Brandom overlooks Hegel's phenomenological method and misunderstands his views on perception, understanding, and contradictions in reality. It suggests that while there are reciprocal dependencies between the world and our structured processes of understanding it (an 'idealist' principle), this does not imply objective idealism as Brandom defines it.

7. Hegel's Method: The author emphasizes that for Hegel, philosophical understanding involves passively following the immanent development of concepts rather than actively doing something to determine their course—a significant difference from Brandom's conception of experience.

In summary, this analysis highlights the complexities and nuances of Hegel's thought as presented in his Phenomenology of Spirit, arguing that Brandom's interpretation oversimplifies or misconstrues key aspects of Hegel's phenomenological method, contradictions within reality, and the nature of self-consciousness. The author maintains that understanding and recognizing these complexities is crucial for accurately comprehending Hegel's philosophical positions.


### 15-Phenomenology and Meaning Attribution

Max van Manen's review essay critiques John Paley's book "Phenomenology as Qualitative Research: A Critical Analysis of Meaning Attribution." Van Manen argues that Paley misunderstands the philosophical nature of phenomenological meaning and inquiry. Here are the key points of his critique:

1. **Meaning Attribution Inappropriateness**: Van Manen contends that Paley's use of 'meaning attribution' as a tool for critiquing phenomenological method is inappropriate, as it originates from psychology (Fritz Heider) and focuses on the causalities and motives behind meaning perception. Phenomenology, according to van Manen, aims at understanding the essential structures of experiences given in consciousness rather than attributing meanings to texts.

2. **Misinterpretation of Husserl**: Van Manen asserts that Paley misrepresents Edmund Husserl's concept of 'essence' by claiming it equals 'concept.' This misunderstanding undermines the philosophical foundation and qualitative depth of phenomenological meaning.

3. **Ignoring Van Manen's Later Work**: Paley critiques van Manen's earlier work, "Researching Lived Experience" (1990), while disregarding van Manen's subsequent publications that explicate the methodology and themes of phenomenological research more thoroughly.

4. **Paley's Dismissal of Essence**: Van Manen criticizes Paley for claiming that 'essence' is absent from van Manen's writings, despite its explicit discussion in "Researching Lived Experience" and further elaboration in subsequent editions.

5. **Lack of Engagement with Key Phenomenological Concepts**: Van Manen points out that Paley fails to engage with crucial phenomenological concepts like the 'epoché' and 'reduction,' which are central to phenomenology as a methodology for uncovering essential structures of experiences.

6. **Heidegger Misinterpretation**: Van Manen argues that Paley misrepresents Martin Heidegger's perspective on lived experience, claiming it doesn't exist, when Heidegger extensively discusses its significance in his works.

7. **Caution with Lived Experience Concept**: Finally, van Manen cautions against simplistic or reductive interpretations of 'lived experience,' emphasizing that phenomenology aims to investigate primal, eidetic meanings often overlooked in everyday life through the epoché and reduction methods.

In summary, van Manen's review essay highlights several perceived misinterpretations, omissions, and methodological shortcomings in Paley's critique of phenomenological research practices, particularly as it pertains to meaning attribution and understanding lived experiences within the philosophical framework of phenomenology.


The passage discusses the phenomenological approach to understanding experiences, using Martin Heidegger's analysis of boredom as an example. Phenomenology is a method that explores the essence of experiences rather than their conceptual or textual meanings. It aims to return to pre-reflective, lived experience and understand it in its own terms, not through the lens of words or concepts.

Heidegger's study of boredom illustrates this approach. He uses descriptive examples—whether factual, imagined, or real—to explicate the meaning of boredom. These examples are not meant to be taken literally as personal accounts but rather as plausible instances that help illustrate the structure and essence of boredom.

The author emphasizes that phenomenology is not about attributing meanings to texts or interpreting them psychologically, but rather about reflecting on lived experiences to uncover their essential structures and meanings. This reflection involves a process called "epoché" (bracketing), where one suspends judgment about the existence of the experienced phenomenon to focus solely on its structure and essence.

The author critiques John Paley's misunderstanding of this method, arguing that Paley mistakenly equates phenomenology with textual analysis or meaning attribution. The author uses Heidegger's work as evidence that phenomenological studies can use empirical (experiential) examples, even if they are fictionalized or derived from historical events.

Furthermore, the author explains that in phenomenology, all experiential descriptions, whether factually observed or personally experienced, are treated as "fiction" once they're engaged in reflective analysis. This fictionalization allows for a focus on the essence of experiences rather than their factual details.

In summary, phenomenology is a method that seeks to understand the essence and structure of lived experiences by reflecting on them through descriptive examples, bracketing judgments about the existence of these experiences, and focusing on their inherent meanings—not on textual or conceptual interpretations.


The text is a review essay by Max van Manen titled "Phenomenology and Meaning Attribution" published in the Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology (Volume 17, Edition 1, July 2017). Van Manen critiques John Paley's book "Phenomenology as Qualitative Research: A Critical Analysis of Meaning Attribution."

Van Manen begins by explaining the essence of phenomenological analysis (or reflective writing), emphasizing that it aims to understand and describe lived experiences from the perspective of those who have them. The meaning of an experience is determined by the individual experiencing it, not by external interpretations or theories.

Van Manen then discusses his motivation for choosing children's experiences of being left or abandoned as a focus in his research. This interest stems from his pedagogical background and desire to help professionals understand the traumatic impact of such separations, particularly in cases involving foster care, war-related displacement, and adoption issues.

The author expresses disappointment with Paley's work, noting that while Paley promises a phenomenological exploration in his book, it fails to deliver on this promise. Instead of presenting an example of phenomenological research, Paley offers critiques of others' qualitative nursing studies. Van Manen laments the lack of a dissertation or published phenomenological study by Paley, questioning his credibility as an educator and researcher in the field.

Furthermore, Van Manen argues that Paley's critique of empathy in Chapter 7 is misguided because it does not engage with the existing phenomenological literature on empathy, which includes works by Husserl, Stein, Scheler, and Merleau-Ponty. Instead, Paley focuses on a study about medical students' understanding of empathy, which is more aligned with psychological research than phenomenology.

Finally, Van Manen criticizes the tone of Paley's writing as needlessly disrespectful and uninformed, citing comments from six colleagues who describe his critical approach as "lazy," "abusive," and "incorrect." He concludes by stating that while it is easy to criticize research methodologies, Paley's critiques lack constructive value in phenomenological methodology.

References are provided at the end of the essay, citing works from various phenomenological philosophers like Heidegger, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Stein, and Scheler, as well as studies in attribution theory, empathy, and nursing research. 

In summary, Van Manen's essay is a critical analysis of John Paley's book, questioning the author's credibility, methodological approach, and understanding of phenomenological principles. The review praises phenomenology as a valuable tool for understanding lived experiences while criticizing Paley for failing to apply these principles correctly in his work.


### 15-Speaking after the Phenomenon_ the Promise of Things and the Future of Phenomenology

The article "Speaking after the Phenomenon: The Promise of Things and the Future of Phenomenology" by Felix Ó Murchadha explores the nature of phenomenology and its relationship to faith, reason, language, and the concept of transcendentals.

1. Faith: The author argues that perception involves an act of faith in the world. This faith is rooted in love for oneself and others, trusting that things express a promise of being that we can anticipate or fulfill our desires through. Perceiving things means placing faith in their potential to deliver on this promise, which may never be fully realized.

2. Transcendentals: The author introduces the concept of transcendentals from medieval philosophy—beings such as 'being', 'one', 'truth', 'good', and 'beauty'. These are not specific instances but rather the conditions that make appearances possible. They are universal in their ability to apply across all entities, opening up thinking, speaking, and being to the world's totality.

3. Selving: The author suggests a term borrowed from poet Gerald Manley Hopkins—'selving'—to describe how things manifest or unfold their own being in their appearance. This selving is not an abstraction but rather a unique, momentary expression of the thing's existence, which reveals its integrity and uniqueness.

4. Truth: The truth of things is not about propositional accuracy but about appearing as they are—giving themselves to be what they truly are. A true diamond or athlete manifests their nature without deception, revealing the promise of their being in relation to perceiving selves.

5. Promise: Central to this phenomenological perspective is the idea of promise. Things present a promise—a directionality or tendency towards being—which we can anticipate and respond to with our desires. This promise is not merely a human construct but inherent to things themselves, shaping how they appear to us.

6. Relation to experience: Phenomenology, according to the author, moves from the level of specific things (with names) to the level of universal terms (like transcendentals). It speaks "after" the phenomenon—both late in the sense that it comes after initial perception and desiring in the sense of always aiming towards more. This position allows phenomenology to validate its metaphysical insights through experience, avoiding the trap of self-fulfilling philosophical acts.

7. Future of phenomenology: The author suggests that the future of phenomenology lies in remaining focused on experience and the "promise" of things guiding perception. This involves developing a language capable of responding to this promise while allowing for philosophical reflection on it, avoiding reductions to mere images or caricatures.

The article thus proposes that phenomenology's strength lies in its ability to speak about the appearing of things in terms of their promises and the faith we place in them, using a language attuned to the nuances of experience and guided by transcendentals.


The text presented is a philosophical exploration of the nature of perception, emotion, time, and the self. The author, Felix Ó Murchadha, delves into these themes from a phenomenological perspective, emphasizing the importance of empathy, passion, and contingency in understanding our relationship with the world.

1. **Perception and Empathy**: Ó Murchadha posits that perception is not merely an act of objectification but also involves an empathetic response to the thing's self-expression. He critiques the assumption that empathy requires a shared emotional experience, arguing instead for a universal grammar of expression that we gradually lose sensitivity to due to de-animation or disenchantment. The author suggests that things appear as selves, expressing their indoor being and inviting us into their worldliness.

2. **Beauty**: Beauty is described as the mode by which things allure and enrapture us, promising not just pleasure but also a happy world. However, this promise doesn't imply egotism; instead, it challenges us to accept the world as given through the object of beauty. The thing's appearance transforms our phenomenological gaze, reducing us to one among many who find their center in its beauty.

3. **Time and Emotion**: Ó Murchadha argues that perception involves temporality; we perceive things in their past and future, not just present. The self-expression of the thing is temporary and contingent, arising from a relation to other beings and the world, including us as perceivers. This temporality raises metaphysical questions about the nature of time and our place within it.

4. **Emotion**: Emotions are understood as responses to the world's passion rather than auto-affective feelings projected onto objects. The author contends that we can know an emotion through perceiving its expression in things, both animate and inanimate. This perspective challenges traditional views of emotions as first felt subjectively before being projected externally.

5. **Philosophical Reflection**: Ó Murchadha defends phenomenology against claims of idealism or speculative realism, arguing that it recognizes the contingency and passivity inherent in our relationship with things. He asserts that philosophy's task is to think and speak from the passion of being, acknowledging human reason's limitations and the risk involved in seeking understanding amidst the world's fragility and mystery.

In conclusion, Ó Murchadha's work emphasizes the importance of contingency, empathy, and temporality in our perception and experience of the world. By challenging conventional views on perception, emotion, and the self, he offers a nuanced perspective that highlights the interconnectedness between human beings and their environment.


### 15-Using a simulated environment to investigate experiences reported during space travel

Title: Using a Simulated Environment to Investigate Experiences Reported During Space Travel

Authors: Shaun Gallagher, Lauren Reinerman-Jones, Brandon Sollins, and Bruce Janz

Published in Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science (2014)

Summary:

This study aims to replicate the experiences of awe and wonder reported by astronauts during space travel using a simulated environment. The researchers developed a multidisciplinary approach involving simulation construction, physiological assessment, psychological testing, textual analysis, and phenomenological interviews.

1. Textual Analysis:
   - Analyzed 51 accounts of experiences by astronauts during space flight.
   - Identified categories such as awe (A), wonder (W), and awe/wonder (AW).
   - Conducted hermeneutical analysis to derive specific categories from the astronauts' own expressions, leading to a consensus set of 34 categories.

2. Image Interpretation:
   - Chose images for a simulated environment (Virtual Space Lab) based on criteria such as image quality, absence of artifacts, and suitability for spacecraft views.
   - Selected the Blue Marble 2012 composite image as a basis for developing a three-dimensional simulation, modifying it to include a crescent element.

3. VSL Design:
   - Built the Virtual Space Lab in a laboratory at the University of Central Florida.
   - Implemented a seated workstation scenario to minimize differences between weightlessness and one-g conditions.
   - Included convincing auditory effects for launch and landing sequences, along with minimal visual distractions during space views.

4. Method:
   - Recruited 38 participants (13 males, 25 females) from general psychology classes to participate in a simulated space flight experience.
   - Used questionnaires to assess religious/spiritual preferences, need for cognition, openness to abstract concepts, and immersion tendencies.
   - Employed a mixed design (2(earth or deep space) × 2(object or no object)) with repeated measures on the first variable, allowing investigation of experiencers vs. non-experiencers of AW.

5. Physiological Measures:
   - Monitored participants' brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy.
   - Assessed heart rate, heart rate variability, and oxygenation of cortical tissue in the pre-frontal cortex using the Covidien INVOS 5100C Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter System.

6. Phenomenological Interview:
   - Conducted a 30-minute interview using a specific technique developed in Paris to explore participants' experiences during the simulated space flight.
   - Analyzed transcriptions of phenomenological interviews using hermeneutical and syntactic methods, comparing results with astronauts' reports.

Results:
- Preliminary analysis suggests that participants' responses are similar to those expressed in astronauts' reports, including experiences like aesthetic appreciation, scale effects (indicating awe), and perspectival shifts (reﬂecting wonder).
- The study aims to identify relations between experiencers vs. non-experiencers of AW with questionnaire and physiological responses in future analyses.


This research study aimed to replicate and understand experiences reported by astronauts during spaceflight, specifically instances of Awe (AW) and Wonder (W), using simulation technology within an Earth-based laboratory setting. The experiment involved participants viewing immersive visual simulations designed to evoke similar responses to those experienced in outer space.

The study employed a mixed-reality environment that combined physical structures with simulated visuals. Participants were exposed to four different conditions: Earth (without objects), Earth with an object (International Space Station, ISS), Deep Space without objects, and Deep Space with objects (galaxies, stars). The researchers analyzed participants' verbal reports during and after the simulations, using a hermeneutical approach to identify and classify experiences.

The primary findings indicate that the simulation methodology was effective in replicating certain aspects of astronauts' experiences:

1. Perspectival shift (a change in moral or spatial perspective): This was the most frequently reported experience, occurring 42 times in post-simulation interviews. 

2. Interest/inquisitiveness and Contentment: These emotions were also commonly experienced by participants during the simulations.

3. Awe and Wonder correlations with religious/spiritual traits: Experiencers of awe reported lower levels of experiential comforting faith and private religious practices compared to non-experiencers, suggesting that religious or spiritual beliefs may influence the likelihood of experiencing AW. Conversely, participants who experienced awe in the Deep Space with Object condition tended to engage in more frequent religious practices than non-experiencers.

4. Intuition and trance: Participants who experienced awe during the Earth with Object condition reported lower levels of intuition and trance, indicating that these individuals may rely less on abstract, imaginative thinking when interpreting their surroundings. 

5. Need for Cognition (NFC): Higher NFC scores were associated with experiencing awe in the Earth with Object condition, suggesting that people who prefer concrete, logical reasoning may be more prone to AW when provided with specific points of reference within the simulated environment.

6. Sensory-perceptual absorption: Individuals who experienced awe during Deep Space conditions scored higher on this scale, implying that they were more immersed and lost in thought while observing vast cosmic scenes.

7. Physiological response correlations: Participants experiencing awe during the Earth condition showed lower levels of left and right hemisphere theta activity, suggesting heightened engagement and alertness compared to non-experiencers who might have been bored or fatigued.

The research highlights the potential of simulation technology for scientific investigation of complex psychological phenomena such as AW and W. However, it also identifies limitations in the current experimental design, particularly regarding immersion types and the need for further studies to isolate visual stimulation from narrative and mixed-reality components. These findings have implications for entertainment, education, and astronaut training, suggesting that carefully designed simulations can evoke new levels of affective states relevant to space exploration.


### 15-_The Individual in the World - The World in the Individual__ Towards a Human Science Phenomeno

Title: 'The Individual in the World - The World in the Individual': Towards a Human Science Phenomenology that Includes the Social World

Author: Karin Dahlberg

Published in: Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology, Volume 6, Special Edition, August 2006

Summary and Explanation:

Karin Dahlberg's article critiques the perception that phenomenological approaches in human science research are overly individualistic and lack consideration for societal and political influences. She argues against abandoning phenomenology, instead suggesting that it can be reconciled with understanding both individuals and their social contexts. Dahlberg proposes Maurice Merleau-Ponty's philosophy as a solution to this challenge.

1. Connectedness of Existence:
   - The article posits that all existence is interconnected, and nothing exists independently. We are all part of the "flesh of the world," meaning our experiences, thoughts, and actions are enmeshed in this vast network of being.
   - This connectedness implies that individuals cannot be separated from their context; instead, they are inseparably bound to it.

2. The Role of Phenomenology:
   - Dahlberg argues for a phenomenological approach that recognizes this interconnectedness and helps understand how the individual relates to their world. Merleau-Ponty's ontology provides an adequate foundation for understanding human existence comprehensively.

3. The Reversibility of Existence:
   - Dahlberg explains that Merleau-Ponty's concept of reversibility of existence demonstrates no ontological divide between the individual and the social world. Instead, the world is inherently 'in' the individual as much as the individual is in the world.

4. Observation in Human Science Research:
   - The author suggests that phenomenology, particularly Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, can offer an epistemology suitable for human science research, focusing on observation and implicit, bodily-embedded knowledge.
   - To gain this understanding, researchers must adopt a distance from the immediate involvement with the world while also remaining close to its meanings.

5. Participation in Phenomenal Events:
   - Dahlberg illustrates how participating directly in phenomena (observation) can uncover meanings that might otherwise remain hidden, such as in interviews or textual analysis.
   - Examples of empirical studies are provided to demonstrate the value of direct observation in elucidating both individual and social world dimensions.

6. Addressing "The More":
   - Dahlberg acknowledges methodological challenges arising from direct participation, such as dealing with an abundance of intentional objects and the researcher's role in wording experiences.
   - She proposes "bridling" one's understanding to avoid overinterpretation and maintains that phenomenological methods like re-enactment interviewing can help navigate these challenges by capturing embodied experiences more effectively.

In conclusion, Dahlberg's article advocates for a phenomenological approach in human science research, using Merleau-Ponty's philosophy to understand the complex relationship between individuals and their social worlds. It emphasizes the importance of observation and direct participation in phenomenal events to gain insights into the interconnectedness of existence.


Title: Navigating the Surplus of Meaning in Participatory Research: A Phenomenological Perspective

Author: Karin Dahlberg

Key Concepts: Phenomenology, Lifeworld, Participatory Research, Meaning, Words, Bridling Understanding

Summary and Explanation:

The article by Karin Dahlberg explores the challenges of participatory research from a phenomenological perspective, focusing on the surplus of meaning inherent in human experiences. The author argues that this "more" presents both opportunities and difficulties for researchers.

1. **Understanding the Lifeworld**: Dahlberg emphasizes that humans are always situated within a lifeworld, which is rich with meaning prior to any reflection on existence. This understanding stems from Edmund Husserl's and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological theories.

2. **The Surplus of Meaning**: The 'surplus' refers to the wealth of meaning in human experiences that can contribute to developing new understandings in research. However, it also poses a problem, as there is a risk of overwhelming data or including irrelevant information ("too much").

3. **The Role of Words**: As researchers cannot directly observe the full richness of lived experiences (especially in phenomenal participation), they must translate their observations into words. This process, however, involves risks: certain words might lead to a more accurate understanding while others could distort it.

4. **Bridling the Understanding**: Dahlberg introduces the concept of 'bridling' as a means to manage these challenges. Bridling involves critically reflecting on one's evolving understanding, ensuring that meanings are captured without over-simplification or misinterpretation. It is about maintaining a balance between closeness and distance in research.

5. **Merleau-Ponty's Influence**: The author references Merleau-Ponty’s philosophy of "the flesh of the world," which asserts that there is no ontological separation between individuals and their social context. This perspective underscores the complexity of research, as it must account for both personal experiences and broader societal influences.

6. **Maintaining Sensitivity**: Researchers need to be sensitive to nuances within lived experiences while being cautious about imposing their own interpretations. They should aim for a sublimated existence in research, one that goes beyond mere description towards a truer understanding of the phenomena studied.

7. **Continued Engagement**: Finally, Dahlberg stresses the importance of maintaining an ongoing, sensitive engagement with the research subject matter. This involves continuous reflection and adjustment to capture the ever-evolving nature of human experiences accurately.

In essence, this article underscores the complexities inherent in phenomenological participatory research. It highlights the necessity for researchers to carefully navigate the surplus of meaning, skillfully using language while avoiding misinterpretation or over-simplification, all while maintaining a deep engagement with and sensitivity towards the subject matter.


### 16-A psychoanalytical phenomenology of perversion1

The article by Juan Pablo Jiménez titled "A psychoanalytical phenomenology of perversion" explores how perversion manifests in the intersubjective field of the analytical relation, specifically in the analyst's mind. The author begins by acknowledging the crisis of consensus and pluralism in psychoanalysis, which necessitates a shift from metapsychological theory to practice, with a focus on the intimacy of the consulting room.

Jiménez introduces the concept of intersubjective reality, borrowed from phenomenology, defined as the shared world between analyst and patient, expressed and structured in language. He argues that psychical reality has an idiosyncratic aspect (non-communicable) and a communicable aspect, which is accessible to others.

The author then discusses perversion from an intersubjective perspective. Perversion is characterized by difficulties in establishing the basic intersubjective agreement that sustains the psychoanalytical relation due to splitting of the ego, denial of castration, and denial of reality (sexual differences and generation differences). These metapsychological properties translate into the analyst's experiential difficulties in understanding the perverse patient.

Jiménez describes how, from the analyst's point of view, a dual relation arises with perverse patients: they share a common world but also inhabit an idiosyncratic universe, a pseudo-reality, which is inaccessible to others and appears as a secret guarded jealously. Empathy becomes challenging as the analyst discovers that the patient does not share the same perspective on everyday situations.

The author discusses the phenomenon of perverse collusion, an unconscious complicity against the analytical work, and suggests that analyzing a pervert involves lifting bulwarks, emerging from entrapment after a second hearing. He provides examples from his clinical practice to illustrate these points.

Jiménez then delves into the explanatory moment (metapsychology) of the phenomenon, referencing various authors' theories about perversion:

1. Freud's 1927 article on fetishism introduced the idea that denial of castration implies ego-splitting, resulting in a dual attitude towards reality.
2. Khan (1979) proposed that perversion is a compulsive attempt to create an experience to conceal and partially substitute the absence of feeling alive as a human being.
3. McDougall (1978, 1986) suggested that perverse patients have a need to generate neo-sexualities to construct a sense of self at the expense of fragmented, defensive, and unreal sexuality.
4. Chasseguet-Smirgel (1984) highlighted the omnipotent pretension inherent in denying the limits of sexual possibilities as a way of protecting oneself from the terrifying awareness of differences in gender and generation.
5. Riesenberg-Malcolm (1970) emphasized analyzing perverse transference rather than symbolism in perverse acts.
6. Joseph (1971) argued that understanding and interpreting the transference phenomena built on the foundation of the perverse patient's internal world is crucial for resolving perversion.
7. Etchegoyen (1977) introduced the concept of 'transference perversion' characterized by erotisation, peculiar narcissistic object relations, and communication to provoke excitement and impatience in the analyst.
8. Ogden (1996) proposed that analyzing perverse transference is only possible from understanding the intersubjective relation as it unfolds in the analytical situation, focusing on the analyst's countertransference.

Ogden suggests that perversion consists of a compulsive and futile effort to extract life from a dead primary scene (parents) experienced as inaccessible or non-existent. He introduces 'flirting with danger' as a method for infusing life into empty primary scenes, which can be observed in the analyst's countertransference responses to perverse patients.

Finally, Jiménez explores the link between phenomenology and metapsychology through Krause's (1993) ideas about the perverse structure. Krause redefines impulse and affect, integrating ethological and developmental research on early mother-infant relations. Perverse structures are defined as 'impossible combinations' of affects and urges, which disrupt natural levels of relation with self and others. These impossible symmetrisations result from the excitement derived from cynically subverting parental sexual truths experienced as lies and frauds.

In summary, Jiménez's article presents a psychoanalytical phenomenology of perversion, examining how perversion manifests in the intersubjective field between analyst and patient. By integrating phenomenological approaches with metapsychological theories, he offers a comprehensive understanding of the perverse structure and its origins in early mother-


The text presents a psychoanalytical phenomenology of perversion, focusing on the nature of the analytic relationship and its intersubjective character. The author argues that understanding perversion requires recognizing this intersubjective dimension, which involves both symmetrical structural poles (where analyst and patient share a singular world and approach to reality) and asymmetrical functional poles (defining role assignments).

In the analysis of a perverse patient, this simetría-asimetría polarity develops unique characteristics. From the subjective perspective of the analyst, perversion appears as a secret, unexpected violation of the fundamental agreement that enables and structures intersubjective encounters. This violation can extend to altering Aristotelian logic rules.

When an analyst enters contact with a perverse patient's psychic reality, their mind forms a world whose atmosphere is deceptively tinged with an eroticization that eventually takes on violent characteristics. The perverse core remains suspended like a false reality, an experience inaccessible to the analyst's empathy.

The only way for the analyst to access this is from "the periphery" of the patient's psychic reality, indirectly attempting to lead them back to their intersubjective roots. The author aims to explain this intersubjective phenomenon through metapsychological concepts and empirically-based theories.

The text draws on various authors and theories to support its arguments:

1. **Welldon (1993)**: Welldon discusses perverse behavior during psychoanalysis as a reaction to therapeutic empathy failure, causing temporary disruptions in the established patient-therapist bond. He argues that understanding perversion requires considering a perverse mother-child relationship, with mothers who abuse their children as if they were an extension of herself.

2. **Krause (1993)**: Krause's research suggests that patients use impossible combinations of affects, urges, and terminal actions to protect and preserve identity. These processes, which involve sexualizing the body image, are uncontrollable, unconscious, and frequent. Pavlovian conditioning leads to stimulation of the genital region being dominated by negative emotions like disgust, causing a disconnect between the genitals and the overall body scheme—a phenomenon known as 'fetish.'

3. **Ogden (1996)**: Ogden asserts that understanding perversion involves more than interpreting fantasies, anxiety, or unconscious defenses; it primarily concerns grasping transference phenomena. This aligns with the text's argument for a phenomenological approach to describe psychopathological structures impacting the analyst's mind explicitly.

4. **Fonagy (1999, 2001)**: Fonagy argues that the relationship between actual experiences and their representation is complicated by individual differences in how infants perceive caregiver behavior. He emphasizes the role of internal states like fantasies, affects, and conflicts in shaping these perceptions. This supports the idea of pluralism and intersubjectivity in psychoanalytic understanding.

The text ultimately advocates for phenomenology as a discipline that can describe clinical phenomena while acknowledging the existence of an objective world. By employing this approach, analysts can better understand and address perverse structures without being overshadowed by metapsychological speculations or ideological group dynamics.


### 16-Phenomenology Without Correlationism_ Husserl_s Hyletic Material

The article "Phenomenology Without Correlationism: Husserl's Hyletic Material" by Patrick Whitehead argues that phenomenological ontology can survive the critique of correlationism from speculative realism. 

1. **Correlationism and Its Critique**: Correlationism is a position attributed to phenomenology, suggesting that subject and object are collapsed into a human-subject correlate. This implies that phenomenology can only understand phenomena through the lens of human consciousness. Speculative realism criticizes this as limiting phenomenology's offerings to critical studies and humanities.

2. **Phenomenological Ontology's Historical Context**: Phenomenology emerged in response to 19th-century mechanical realism, which reduced the world to its smallest parts governed by predictable physical rules. Phenomenologists like Husserl and Merleau-Ponty critiqued this reductionist approach, arguing for a more nuanced understanding of subjectivity and objectivity.

3. **Husserl's Twofold Task**: Husserl proposed a twofold task for phenomenology: hyletic (material) and noetic (mental) phenomenology. The paper suggests that phenomenology can shift its emphasis by de-emphasizing its anti-realist position against the mechanization of humans, moving beyond the 19th-century realism debate.

4. **Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception**: The author uses Merleau-Ponty's seminal work to illustrate how phenomenological ontology can evolve without becoming correlationist. Despite criticisms from Merleau-Ponty himself and others, the paper argues that this text offers a phenomenology that isn't exclusively human-centered.

5. **Hyletic Phenomenology**: The paper advocates for hyletic phenomenology as a way to broaden phenomenological ontology post-correlationism critique. Hyletic phenomenology recognizes the "unhuman" elements in things, allowing for ontological reversibility and understanding non-human aspects of experience.

6. **Conclusion**: The paper concludes by stating that phenomenological ontology can continue to inform philosophy beyond correlationism by embracing a broader emphasis that includes both subjective and objective aspects, without privileging either over the other. This approach allows for an exploration of the world that goes beyond human experience alone.


The text discusses the philosophical concepts of correlationism, phenomenology, and the ontological status of entities before they become differentiated as subjects or objects. It begins by outlining two contrasting views: a critical philosophy that sees nature as an objective unity existing prior to consciousness, and science that places consciousness within nature, understanding their relationship in terms of causality. 

The author argues that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's "Phenomenology of Perception" offers a phenomenological ontology capable of avoiding correlationism. This ontology suggests that non-specific event-entities coalesce into a co-constitutional subject-object relationship, with subjects and objects becoming differentiated only through their mutual relationship. 

The author then introduces Edouard Barbaras' critique of Merleau-Ponty's work, highlighting the philosopher's oscillation between unitary conceptions of the body and dualistic views that treat the body as a means for consciousness. This dualism, according to Barbaras, stems from Merleau-Ponty's failure to fully break away from the Cartesian ambiguity that prioritizes the subject over the object.

The text goes on to explore Edmund Husserl's concept of hylé (material data), which refers to ontologically neutral entities that could become either subjects or objects, depending on their intentional transformation. Hylé is distinguished from psychical objects, which are perceived as empirical realities awaiting human consciousness.

Merleau-Ponty's concept of the "event" serves as an illustrative example in understanding pre-differentiated entities. An event marks a particular relationship between entities—a subject and object—which only becomes clear after the event has unfolded. This event demonstrates that subjectivity and objectivity are not prior conditions but co-emerge within the event, challenging correlationist views that privilege human consciousness as the starting point for understanding reality.

Finally, the text suggests that Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological ontology provides a framework to investigate non-human or posthuman subjectivities and objectivities, which is a position further developed in his work "The Visible and the Invisible." The author argues for an expanded understanding of phenomenology that embraces both hyletic (material) and noetic (intentional) phenomena, thereby moving beyond correlationist stances.


Title: Phenomenology without Correlationism: Husserl's Hyletic Material

Author: Patrick Whitehead

Journal: Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology (Volume 15, Edition 2, October 2015)

In this article, Whitehead explores the concept of hyletic material in phenomenology as a means to critique correlationism and expand phenomenological ontology beyond the mid-20th century intentional subject. Correlationism, according to speculative realists like Graham Harman, limits philosophy by assuming that objects can only be understood through human perception or experience.

Whitehead focuses on Edmund Husserl's concept of hyletic material (hylè) and its relation to Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology. Hylè refers to the passive, receptive, and material aspect of our perception that underlies conscious experience but is not directly accessible to introspection. 

1. Husserl's Hyletic Material: Whitehead delves into Husserl’s (1913/2002) concept of hyletic material, which represents the raw, pre-reflective sensory data that forms the basis for perception and intentionality. He argues that this material aspect is crucial to understanding phenomenology without falling into correlationism because it acknowledges an objective realm separate from consciousness.

2. Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology: The author connects Husserl’s hyletic material with Merleau-Ponty’s (1945/1962) perception, where the body is seen as an active and engaged entity in the world. He suggests that for Merleau-Ponty, the "thing" or hylè remains aloof from human understanding, resisting complete capture by consciousness, thus preserving a non-anthropocentric perspective.

3. The Antinomy of Matter and Form: Whitehead discusses the age-old philosophical problem of the antinomy between matter (hylè) and form (morphe). He explains how both Husserl and Merleau-Ponty grapple with this duality. Husserl attempts to reconcile it through speculative metaphysics, suggesting a fusion of hylè and morphe in an ultimate consciousness. In contrast, Merleau-Ponty refuses to allow a "primordial I" that would unify them, dissolving the categories instead.

4. Phenomenological Ontology and Correlationism: The author asserts that phenomenology should not be limited by correlationism, which assumes human perception as the sole means of understanding reality. By exploring hyletic material, phenomenology can transcend this limitation, allowing for a broader ontology that includes non-human elements.

5. Conclusion: Ultimately, Whitehead contends that phenomenological ontology must evolve to accommodate speculative realism's critique of correlationism. By revisiting Husserl’s hyletic material and Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology, he argues for a richer phenomenological understanding that respects the autonomy of objects beyond human experience.

Key terms:
1. Correlationism: A philosophical viewpoint limiting reality to what is accessible through human perception or consciousness.
2. Hyletic Material (Hylè): The passive, receptive, and material aspect of sensory data that forms the basis for perception and intentionality according to Husserl.
3. Morphe: The active, organizing principle in Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology, representing the form or structure of our experiences.
4. Speculative Realism: A philosophical movement that critiques correlationism and seeks to explore objects' ontological depth independently from human perception.
5. Phenomenological Ontology: The branch of phenomenology concerned with the study of being, existence, or reality.


### 16-Phenomenology as a Potential Methodology for Subjective Knowing in Science Education Research

The author, Oscar Koopman, discusses his journey towards adopting phenomenology as a methodology for science education research. Initially, he sought to explore the lived experiences of black Physical Science teachers when introduced to a new curriculum, focusing on their genealogy (how their scientific knowledge developed) and portraiture (how personal events influenced their teaching journey).

Koopman initially considered ethnography but soon realized it wouldn't allow for an authentic exploration of the teachers' inner experiences. His search led him to Max van Manen's "Researching Lived Experience" (1990), which introduced him to phenomenology as a suitable methodology. Van Manen emphasized that educational research is a caring act requiring deep thoughtfulness and empathy, aiming to express the essence of being human without needing further explanation.

Koopman found phenomenology compelling due to its focus on subjective knowing, pure perception, and lifeworld experiences. He criticized positivistic methods for often ignoring human aspects in favor of mathematical quantification, which he believed eliminated essential sensory experiences. Inspired by Husserl's philosophy, Koopman saw phenomenology as a way to uncover the essence of teachers' challenges with curriculum changes, content knowledge, and pedagogical praxis.

Phenomenology, according to Husserl, involves returning to "things themselves" by suspending preconceived ideas or notions derived from personal experiences or perceptions. This approach generates "pure presentations" or uninterpreted sense data based on experience. Koopman learned that a phenomenologist must watch and enjoy the lived experiences of participants without analysis, only later carrying out objective analysis devoid of emotional involvement or unsubstantiated criticism.

Heidegger's Being and Time (1926/1967) further developed phenomenological ideas, focusing on the nature of being rather than becoming to know. He asserted that consciousness is not separate from the world but formed by historically lived experiences. This philosophy aided Koopman in representing participants' essence accurately by meticulously scrutinizing interview transcripts, revealing fundamental reasons for their behaviors and uncovering tangible structures of their experiences.

Ultimately, Koopman advocates for phenomenology as an essential methodology for science education research, shifting the focus from object-oriented positivism to subjective human experiences. By understanding teachers' lived realities, policy makers, curriculum designers, and educators can gain new insights into curriculum change within Physical Sciences, enriching their perspectives with authentic, contextually grounded knowledge.


The text discusses phenomenology as a research methodology, focusing on its unique aspects and its application in understanding human behavior, particularly in the context of science education. 

Phenomenology is presented as both a theory and a method that centers around lived experiences (dasein). It aims to understand what it means to be by engaging with individuals' perceptions of their world. This approach contrasts with traditional scientific methods, which often focus on objective observation and measurement.

Key points of phenomenology include:

1. **Epistemological and ontological disposition**: Phenomenology is rooted in the lived experiences of individuals, seeking to understand their subjective reality. It emphasizes existence over objects, viewing existence as interconnected with past, present, and future.

2. **Non-methodological journey**: The researcher enters a personal space (domain) of understanding another's perspective. This requires participants to describe their world in their own words. 

3. **Validity check**: Participants are involved in verifying the accuracy of the researcher’s description, ensuring that the essence of their experiences is captured without distortion.

4. **Subjective disposition**: Phenomenology is fundamentally interested in understanding individuals' epistemological and ontological stance. It aims to express truth about a phenomenon in an unbiased way, reflecting both participants' and researchers' understandings using "lived-through data."

5. **The concept of Dasein**: In Heidegger's philosophy, dasein refers to human existence as it is lived out, providing the richest and most revelatory way to engage with a phenomenon in fundamental ontology. 

6. **Limitations of language**: The text acknowledges that language has limitations in accurately representing lived experiences, especially for subjective states like mood or fear. It suggests 'summoning' as a concept to bridge this gap, enabling the medium of language to reveal absent realities.

7. **Consideration of past and present**: To understand human existence comprehensively, phenomenology embraces both past and present experiences. This contrasts with traditional scientific methods that often focus solely on the present object pole.

8. **Unique research methodology**: Phenomenology is described as a 'science of the unique' due to its focus on intuition—a pre-theoretical phenomenon describing directedness towards an object. It treats experiential data (first-person accounts) as pure, uninterpreted phenomena, aiming for a science of pure phenomena.

9. **Consciousness-centered approach**: Phenomenology prioritizes consciousness and human experience, viewing it as a self-transcendent reflection of the participant's perception within their lifeworld. It seeks to understand human existence without objectifying or reducing participants to mere objects of study.

10. **Potential in science education**: The text argues for phenomenology's value in science education, suggesting it can provide deeper insights into teachers' and learners' experiences by focusing on their subjective realities rather than fragmented objective observations.

In summary, the paper advocates for phenomenology as a powerful research methodology for understanding human experiences in their rich complexity, especially in fields like science education where subjective perspectives are crucial to understanding educational dynamics. It emphasizes the importance of bracketing one's preconceived notions and embracing a non-judgmental attitude towards participants' unique worlds to gain profound insights into human behavior and consciousness.

Here's a summary and explanation of some key authors and their contributions to phenomenological thought:

1. **Max van Manen**: Van Manen is a prominent figure in phenomenological research, especially in educational contexts. His works, such as "Researching Lived Experience: Human Science for an Action Sensitive Pedagogy" (1990), emphasize the importance of understanding human experiences and lived realities within pedagogical practices.

2. **Husserl, Edmund**: Husserl is considered one of the founding fathers of phenomenology. His seminal work "Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology" (1913) introduces key concepts like intentionality and epoché (bracketing), which are fundamental to phenomenological methodology. Other works by Husserl, such as "The Crisis of European Sciences" (1936) and "Logical Investigations" (1901), further explore his philosophical views on logic, consciousness, and perception.

3. **Heidegger, Martin**: A central figure in 20th-century European thought, Heidegger's "Being and Time" (1927) is a landmark work in existential phenomenology. It explores the question of Being (Sein), focusing on Dasein (human existence) and its relationship with time, understanding, and authenticity. His later works, such as "The Essence of Truth" (1932), delve into hermeneutics and the nature of truth.

4. **Merleau-Ponty, Maurice**: Merleau-Ponty's "Phenomenology of Perception" (1945) presents a first-person perspective on perception and embodiment, challenging traditional Cartesian dualism. His work emphasizes the primacy of bodily experience in understanding our existence within the world.

5. **Gadamer, Hans-Georg**: Gadamer's "Truth and Method" (1960) introduces the concept of hermeneutic fusion of horizons, which describes how our understanding is always dialogical and influenced by our historical and cultural contexts. This work has significantly impacted phenomenological research methodologies, particularly in qualitative social sciences.

6. **Moustakas, Constantine**: Moustakas' "Phenomenological Research Methods" (1994) provides a comprehensive guide to applying phenomenology in social science research, emphasizing the importance of understanding human experiences and their subjective meanings.

7. **Sartre, Jean-Paul**: Sartre's existential phenomenology is outlined in "Being and Nothingness" (1943), where he discusses concepts like bad faith, authenticity, and freedom. His work has influenced various disciplines, including education, psychology, and sociology.

These authors, along with others listed in the bibliography, have significantly contributed to phenomenological thought by developing philosophical foundations, methodological guidelines, and practical applications of phenomenology across different fields. Their works provide essential theoretical frameworks for researchers seeking to understand human experiences and realities through a phenomenological lens.


### 16-Simone Weil_s Phenomenology of the Body

Simone Weil, a French philosopher, was a pioneering phenomenologist who centered her early thinking on the foundational role of the body in structuring thought and ordering the world. Her ideas diverged significantly from René Descartes' subject-object bifurcation and the dualistic Cartesian model that characterized modern philosophy.

Weil's 1930 dissertation, "Science and Perception in Descartes," aimed to demonstrate that ordinary people already employ fundamental principles of science in their perception and daily work without realizing it. To achieve this, she used the Cartesian method of doubting but with a key difference: instead of doubting the body, sensation, movement, and place as chimeras, Weil maintained that pure sensation cannot be doubted due to its immediacy and irreducibility.

Weil's fictitious thinker starts with sensation alone, devoid of any knowledge or preconceptions about the world. This hypothetical subject perceives the world through an unselfconscious "sentient I" that exists solely through a sensorium of mixed pleasure-pain responses. In this initial state, the thinker cannot distinguish between sensation and thought, as both are bound by chance and givenness.

The thinker's power lies in the ability to withhold belief (doubt), which reveals self-knowledge and knowledge of an external reality. Through this negative power, the thinker discovers a realm of freedom that is heterogeneous to the realms of sensation and random thought. The act of doubting causes existence by creating an obstacle for the mind to overcome.

However, Weil argues that the mind alone cannot effectively reconcile sensation and thought. Instead, it requires concerted bodily action or work as the instrument through which the mind can engage with the world's obstacles. The body acts as a pincer for the mind to grasp and handle the world, turning sensations into ordered perceptions.

Weil's unique perspective emerged in her lectures on philosophy from 1933-1934, delivered at a girls' lycée in Roanne. She reaffirmed that the senses are passive and present an infinite variety of sensations teaching us nothing about the world without movement. Perception is the construal of sensation by the imagination through active bodily movements. These movements allow for the reduction of infinite sensory data into a limited number of generalizations, enabling the body to grasp wholes in relationship and order the world accordingly.

Weil's ideas diverge from Descartes' cogito, as she posits that imagination is not separate from the human body but its primary instrument for knowledge about the world. Although she does not systematically analyze this identity of body-imagination, her bold claim asserts that there seems to be no contradiction in reducing the imagination to the human body and making it the only instrument of knowledge concerning the world.

In summary, Simone Weil's phenomenology of the body emphasizes the primacy of bodily movement as the foundation for ordered spatial-temporal perception. This perception, in turn, serves as a basis for abstract thought and language. By grounding thinking in the body, Weil offers a perspective that reconfigures the very origination of thought itself, aligning her ideas with those of Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception but predating his work by more than a decade.


Simone Weil's philosophy of the body posits a profound interdependence between mind, body, and the world, which she explores through her phenomenological approach. She argues that order is fundamental to human existence and perception, with our bodies serving as the primary medium for experiencing and understanding this order.

In her early work, Weil contends that the geometry of the body-imagination underlies normal perception; our minds unconsciously apply geometric principles when we think about points, lines, and angles. She emphasizes the "bodily primacy of all order in human life," warning against the detrimental effects of modern civilization that have led to a disconnection between mind and body.

This loss of contact, according to Weil, has resulted in an intellectual culture characterized by absurdity and irrationality, as people have abandoned essential concepts like limit, measure, proportion, relation, comparison, contingency, interdependence, and interrelation of means and ends. She believes that restoring the mind-body equilibrium can help reunify and revitalize scientific and philosophical knowledge by grounding these pursuits in the body-imagination.

In her later religious reflections, Weil extends this body-centric perspective to faith, emphasizing the importance of incarnation within Christianity and non-Christian traditions. She posits that our bodies' needs and proportions define the world in a certain way by predisposing us towards specific perceptions and correspondences. The human universe is, thus, a section cut out of the greater universe based on our body's dimensions and structure.

Weil argues for amor fati (love of fate) as the unifying force between the macrocosm and microcosm orders. She contends that learning about the world involves bodily engagement with it, obediently submitting to its strict discipline, and understanding that thought is merely illusory until it applies itself to bodily knowledge of reality.

In her philosophy, the human body is a "little world" that corresponds to a larger universe due to our primal need for order. This correspondence is manifest through relationships between things that touch our body and evoke an emotional response. Weil identifies music as a prime example of this phenomenon, where specific relationships of tone, timbre, and measure elicit emotions directly through the bodily imagination.

Carnal love, for Weil, is a quest for incarnation, expressing our longing to love beauty in another human being. Her later thinking introduces the concept of detachment as a means to purify attachment from willed desire, thereby transmuting erotic energy into a form suitable for love of God. This transformation allows us to extend our love universally and regard all things as part of ourselves, embodying the mystery of the Incarnation in daily life.

Weil's philosophy of the body ultimately emphasizes the fundamental role of bodily mediation in shaping our worldview, thought processes, and spiritual experiences. By integrating mind and body, she provides a comprehensive framework for understanding human existence within the context of both reality and faith.

The works in this volume reflect Foucault's intellectual evolution during his early career, offering insights into the development of his later, more recognized ideas on power/knowledge, discourse analysis, and historical methodology.

2. **Alfred North Whitehead's "Science and the Modern World"**

   - Published in 1925: This book was written by Alfred North Whitehead, an eminent British mathematician and philosopher, and published by Free Press (now a part of Simon & Schuster) in New York.
   
   - Content Overview: "Science and the Modern World" is a foundational text that explores the relationship between science and Western society, particularly in the context of modernity. Whitehead critiques what he perceives as the narrow understanding of scientific methodology dominant at his time. He argues for an organic and historical approach to science, emphasizing its cultural embeddedness rather than viewing it as a purely objective, value-free pursuit. 

   Key Points:
   - Whitehead posits that science is inherently connected with human values and philosophical perspectives, which are often overlooked or dismissed in traditional scientific methodology.
   - He introduces his concept of "creative evolution," a philosophical perspective on the development of the universe that integrates both biological evolution and historical change. This concept significantly influenced later thinkers such as Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and influenced process philosophy more broadly.
   - The book also contains Whitehead's reflections on the role of mathematics in science, critiquing what he sees as over-reliance on mathematical formalism at the expense of intuition and conceptual understanding. 

Both works contribute significantly to their respective fields – Foucault's "PEP" offers a foundational collection of early philosophical writings that chart his intellectual development, while Whitehead's "Science and the Modern World" provides a critique of scientific methodology and presents an alternative, holistic perspective on science and its place in society.


### 16-The role of embodiment and intersubjectivity in clinical reasoning

The article "The role of embodiment and intersubjectivity in clinical reasoning" by Shaun Gallagher and Helen Payne explores how embodied cognition and intersubjective interactions contribute to the process of clinical reasoning in psychotherapy. The authors argue against traditional views that consider clinical reasoning as primarily mental or intellectual processes, focusing on thinking, reflecting, evaluating, identifying problems, and establishing goals. Instead, they propose a phenomenologically informed enactive conception of clinical reasoning as an ongoing embodied, embedded, and intersubjective process.

The authors distinguish between the objective body (body-as-object) and the lived body (body-as-subject), emphasizing the body's active role in perceiving, experiencing, and acting upon the world. They assert that embodied cognition approaches, informed by phenomenology, view the mind as distributed across brain, body, and environment, with bodily processes and environmental factors contributing irreducibly to the constitution of cognition.

In clinical settings, this perspective implies that clinical reasoning involves hands-on practice, manipulation of the environment, and interaction with patients. The authors highlight that visual observation of a patient at rest may differ from judgments made during dynamic action or physical interaction between clinician and patient. They also emphasize the importance of intercorporeity – a dynamic intersubjective embodied interaction involving proprioception and kinaesthesia, where the first-person experience of the body is modulated by a second-person experience of interacting with others.

The authors provide examples from dance movement psychotherapy to illustrate how embodied interaction contributes to clinical reasoning through shared 'dances' or movement dialogues between therapist and patient, where nonverbal communication and kinaesthetic intersubjectivity create new perceptions and meanings.

The authors further distinguish between processes of coordination "to" (individual unidirectional embodied actions) and "with" (interactive coordination involving both parties). Coordination with implies two active participants—the therapist, using multidimensional professional knowledge, and the patient, who expresses themselves in various bodily ways. This shared enactive coupling supports an embodied clinical reasoning accomplished through joint attention and joint action, often resulting in a shared agency and participatory sense-making.

In conclusion, Gallagher and Payne propose that clinical reasoning is not solely an 'in the head' intellectual process but rather involves non-conceptual, non-propositional, extra-neural factors of body and environment. Decision-making in therapeutic practice is thus co-constituted by a meeting of eye-gaze and gesture as the therapist interacts with the patient, feeling resistance or accommodation. They argue that successful clinical reasoning requires a multidimensional knowledge, integrating theory and research, embodied techne (technical knowledge), and intersubjective phronesis (practical wisdom) in a co-constructed meaning. This approach emphasizes the importance of primary intersubjectivity, contextual factors (secondary intersubjectivity), and narratives brought by both therapist and patient to the clinical setting for participatory sense-making and mutual understanding.


The provided references touch upon the concept of embodied cognition, clinical reasoning, and the role of body and movement in various therapeutic settings. Here's a detailed summary and explanation of these topics:

1. **Embodied Cognition**: This interdisciplinary field explores how our mind and body are intrinsically connected, challenging the traditional view of cognition as purely mental or computational processes isolated from the body (Varela et al., 1991). Key scholars in this area include Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Andy Clark. Embodied cognition suggests that our perception, understanding, and interaction with the world are deeply rooted in our bodily experiences (Thompson, 2007).

   - Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception (1962) emphasizes the first-person perspective and the role of the body schema – a dynamic and flexible representation of one's body – in shaping our perceptual experiences.
   - Noë (2004) proposes that action and perception are intertwined, arguing that perceiving is always a form of action and understanding is grounded in bodily experience.
   - Thompson and Varela's Radical Embodiment (2001) suggests that consciousness emerges from the dynamic interactions between an organism and its environment, highlighting the role of neural dynamics in shaping our experiences.

2. **Clinical Reasoning**: Clinical reasoning refers to the cognitive processes used by healthcare professionals to diagnose and manage patient care (Levett-Jones et al., 2009). The authors emphasize that clinical reasoning is a complex, multidimensional process involving both explicit (rule-based) and tacit (experiential) forms of knowledge. Key elements include pattern recognition, hypothesis generation, problem solving, and the integration of diverse information sources.

   - Øberg et al. (in press) explore embodied clinical reasoning in neurological physical therapy, arguing that bodily experiences and sensorimotor expertise play a crucial role in understanding patients' conditions and developing effective treatment plans.
   - Ofri (2010) highlights the significance of touch – an often overlooked aspect of clinical reasoning – in establishing rapport, gathering information, and informing diagnostic decisions.

3. **Body, Movement, and Dance in Psychotherapy**: Scholars like Payne (2006a) argue that body-centered approaches to psychotherapy (e.g., dance movement therapy, authentic movement groups) can facilitate self-awareness, emotional expression, and interpersonal connection by engaging clients' bodily experiences and sensorimotor processes (Payne, 2006b). These methods challenge languaged ways of knowing and emphasize the role of nonverbal communication in fostering wellbeing.

   - Scho¨n's Reflective Practitioner (1991) advocates for a reflective stance that integrates bodily experiences with cognitive and theoretical knowledge, allowing practitioners to continually adapt and improve their practice.
   - Rucinska & Reijmers (2014) apply embodied and enactive cognition frameworks to systemic play therapy, highlighting the role of intersubjective synchronization in fostering shared understanding and empathy between clients and therapists.

4. **Physical Examination**: The value of physical examinations in healthcare is recognized by scholars like Verghese & Horwitz (2009), who argue that they provide essential reasoning frameworks, foster professional identity, and facilitate a holistic understanding of patients' conditions beyond laboratory tests alone.

5. **Intersubjectivity**: Concepts of primary and secondary intersubjectivity, introduced by Trevarthen (1979) and Trevarthen & Hubley (1978), highlight the development of shared understanding between individuals through pre-linguistic, embodied means – essential for building therapeutic relationships and fostering wellbeing.

6. **Kinaesthetic Intersubjectivity**: Samaritter & Payne (2013) propose kinaesthetic intersubjectivity as a dance-informed approach to nonverbal psychotherapy, emphasizing the importance of shared sensorimotor experiences in facilitating mutual understanding and connection between therapists and clients.

In summary, these references collectively underscore the significance of embodied cognition in various therapeutic contexts – recognizing that our perceptions, understandings, and interactions are deeply rooted in bodily experiences – and advocate for integrating body-centered approaches into clinical reasoning processes.


### 17-Interpretive Hermeneutic Phenomenology_ Clarifying Understanding

Title: Interpretive Hermeneutic Phenomenology: Clarifying Understanding

Author: Ann E. McManus Holroyd

Journal: Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology (IPJP)

Published: September 2007, Volume 7, Issue 2

Overview:

This article explores the philosophical orientation of Gadamerian hermeneutic phenomenology as an alternative to traditional scientific methodologies in understanding human experiences. The author argues that hermeneutics, rooted in existential understanding and interpretive procedures, offers a different mode of being before it is a mode of knowing.

Key Concepts:

1. Hermeneutics: A philosophical approach to interpretation, dating back to the 17th century, with origins in biblical studies. Its central concern is understanding, defined as an encounter with texts and non-texts that are initially strange and distant from the interpreter.

2. Phenomenology of Existential Understanding: This domain of hermeneutics emphasizes personal experiences of being in the world, focusing on language as a crucial aspect of human existence and understanding.

3. Fore-Structure of Understanding: Heidegger's concept referring to an innate capacity that exists in all individuals to intuit the meaning of being, guiding our encounters with the world through preconceived notions (fore-having, fore-sight, fore-conception). 

4. Hermeneutic Circle: The process by which understanding moves beyond subjective or objective interpretations and instead involves the interplay between tradition and interpretation, allowing for the examination of fore-conceptions reduced to popular conceptions.

5. Art of Understanding (Verstehen): Gadamer's term for the hermeneutic process, likened to a game with to-and-fro movement in encountering that which we seek to understand. It starts with reflecting on one's own fore-projections or pre-understandings and their meanings before containing their influence on new understanding.

6. Interpretation from a Hermeneutic Perspective: Always begins with the interpreter's fore-projections, influenced by their history, culture, language, and sociopolitical experiences, which shape familiar horizons of one's lifeworld.

7. Gaps in Inter-Subjectivity: Arising when illness is constructed in a technical and highly epistemological way, context or story is often overlooked, leading to obscurity in meaning and difficulties in understanding the individual's experience.

The article argues that interpretive hermeneutic phenomenology offers an alternative to traditional scientific methodologies by focusing on encounters, lifeworlds, and personal experiences of being in the world, rather than attempting to control or eliminate natural unpredictable human experiences. It emphasizes the importance of language as a structural aspect of human-being-in-the-world and encourages individuals to recognize the limitations within their dominant ideologies when understanding human phenomena.


The text discusses the philosophical underpinnings of hermeneutic understanding, particularly focusing on the work of Martin Heidegger and Hans-Georg Gadamer. It argues that health professionals' limited understanding of individuals, especially in relation to illness, stems from clinical literalism—a focus on facts, truths, and clinical details rather than a deeper, more personal connection with the patient's subjective experience.

The authors propose moving beyond this clinical literalism by merging health professionals' own history and culture with that of their patients. This approach is rooted in hermeneutics, which posits that understanding arises from the fusion of the familiar (the health professional's lifeworld) with the unfamiliar (the patient's lifeworld). 

Language plays a crucial role in this process, as it is where our world—our lifeworld—is disclosed. Unlike the classic view that sees language as an instrument of thought and communication, Heidegger and Gadamer argue that we are born into language, and our thinking and knowing are inherently biased due to our linguistic interpretation. 

Understanding, according to these philosophers, is not a purely individual, intra-psychic activity but occurs through dialogue between individuals, mediated by language. It involves a loss of self and transcends subjectivist and objectivist stances, moving between tradition and interpretation.

Gadamer further introduces the concept of horizons, which refers to the range of vision from a particular vantage point. He emphasizes the importance of gaining an appropriate historical horizon for understanding something in its true dimensions. Gadamer argues that there are no closed horizons; instead, understanding is always a fusion of these moving horizons.

The text also critiques the dominance of methodology in research, suggesting that this approach can limit understanding by creating fixed standpoints and solitary horizons of meaning. It advocates for an openness to the social, historical, and temporal nature of life and the role of language in all understanding, aligning with Gadamer's humanist tradition and concept of Bildung—the properly human way of developing one's natural talents and capacities.

In essence, the text underscores the need for health professionals to engage in interpretive hermeneutic inquiry, which transcends method as we typically understand it. It calls for a phenomenological approach that recognizes the philosophical underpinnings of understanding and values what happens beyond our wanting and doing—the unexpected insights that emerge from dialogue with research participants. This approach acknowledges the limitations of one's own understanding, resists oversimplifying complex experiences like chronic illness, and avoids imposing predetermined categories or realities onto patients' lived experiences.


The text discusses the philosophical perspectives of realism and interpretivism, specifically within the context of understanding illness and healthcare. 

1. Realist Perspective: This perspective assumes that knowledge about objects (including diseases) is obtained through an objective distance from the world. The individual's subjective experience and personal narrative are de-emphasized, and the focus shifts to the disease itself as the object of investigation. Validity in this context heavily relies on methodology, with careful specification thought to be the key to certain knowledge.

2. Interpretivist Perspective: In contrast, interpretivists argue that truth is not based on a one-to-one correspondence to objective reality but rather emerges from social discourses and interactions. Understanding is seen as dynamic, influenced by past and present engagements with the world. This approach values inspiration over methodological calculation, emphasizing intimate relationships between patients and healthcare staff that involve shared time, personal history, and recognition of differences.

3. Gadamer's Hermeneutic Experience: Gadamer introduces a learning experience concept where truth is not merely an accumulation of experiences but a transformative process. A "negative dialectical experience" (Warnke, 1987) occurs when one's previous views are negated due to new insights or disappointments, leading to a profound shift in consciousness.

4. Experience as Learning: Gadamer’s hermeneutic experience is distinct from everyday understanding, as it involves a radical transformation of the individual rather than just expanding their awareness passively. This transformative learning process (Warnke, 1987) leads to recognizing that one's previous notions about reality might be partial or erroneous.

5. Dialectical Experience: Gadamer posits that experiences create a rupture between self and world, stimulating a reevaluation of prior understandings. This dialectical experience (Gadamer, 1960/1989) is central to hermeneutics; it highlights how our understanding evolves through questioning previously held beliefs and uncovering new perspectives.

6. Hermeneutic Phenomenology in Research: The paper concludes by discussing interpretive hermeneutic phenomenological research, which is challenging due to its philosophical underpinnings but crucial for understanding human experiences, including illness. It requires an openness to life experiences and a willingness to question one's own understanding, recognizing that there are no absolute truths. This approach encourages health professionals to engage in the science of interpretation and fosters dialogical encounters with those they seek to understand.

In summary, this text contrasts realist and interpretivist perspectives in understanding illness, highlighting Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy as an alternative that emphasizes learning from experiences, dialectical relationships, and the continuous revision of understanding within a temporal structure of one's lifeworld.


### 17-Making sense of the libertarian_s semantic claim about agential phenomenology

Title: Making sense of the libertarian's semantic claim about agential phenomenology

Author: Andrew Sims

Journal: Philosophical Explorations, 2019, Vol. 22, No. 1, 16-32

Summary and Explanation:

Andrew Sims presents an argument in favor of the plausibility of the libertarian's semantic claim regarding agential phenomenology—our conscious experience as agents—in this paper. The central issue is whether our agential phenomenology can be compatible with determinism, which leads to a debate between compatibilists (who argue for compatibility) and libertarians (who argue for incompatibility).

1. Libertarian Argument L: Sims outlines the argument (L) by O'Connor, stating that if our experience of freedom has libertarian content, then it would be veridical only if libertarianism is true, thereby providing a pro tanto reason to endorse libertarianism. The main objection to this argument lies in the semantic claim (2), which suggests that agential phenomenology has libertarian content.

2. Compatibility of experience with determinism: Sims argues against the notion that our perceptual processes can deliver knowledge about metaphysical facts, as it seems unlikely we could have experiences contradicting determinism due to its requirement for immediate access to facts beyond our perceptual capacities. However, he posits that having an experience in contradiction with determinism is possible if the experience depicts a world with more than one physically possible future.

3. Modest pragmatism about perception: Sims relies on recent work in the study of perception to support his argument. He introduces Gibson's (1979) theory that we sometimes perceive possibilities for action ("affordances") independently from objects or environmental features. Although this radical view is not widely endorsed, a "modest pragmatism" about perception has become commonplace in recent literature. This modest pragmatism suggests that our perceptions are inferential, representational, action-oriented, and include affordances.

4. Libertarian satisfaction conditions: Sims defines the necessary experience for libertarian free will as (LE*), where it is physically possible for an agent to perform an action w and also not perform that same action at a given time t. This experience's satisfaction conditions are in contradiction with determinism, which entails only one physically possible future.

5. Evidence from perceptual research: Sims presents evidence supporting the view that we consciously perceive modal properties, such as possibilities for action (affordances). He describes modest pragmatism and empirical studies on vision-for-action, showing how our visual system processes information related to action possibilities. Furthermore, he discusses Goodale and Milner's Two Visual Systems Hypothesis, which suggests that the dorsal pathway of the visual system is involved in perceiving affordances for action, while the ventral pathway focuses on object recognition and properties.

6. Modal properties in our phenomenology: Sims argues that, based on modest pragmatism about perception, we indeed have experiences with modal contents—particularly possibilities for action (affordances). These experiences can be interpreted as having libertarian satisfaction conditions because they present us with the world as having more than one physically possible future.

7. Addressing phenomenological concerns: Sims acknowledges potential criticisms regarding the conscious experience of modal properties and affordances, but he maintains that our perceptual systems can represent these modal properties. He suggests that even if we do not consciously experience modality directly, there is empirical evidence supporting the integration of modal representations in perception.

8. Implications: Sims concludes by stating that understanding agential phenomenology as having libertarian satisfaction conditions does not necessarily entail endorsing libertarianism itself but provides a plausible account for how our experience could support such an interpretation. However, he acknowledges limitations and open questions in the debate regarding the relationship between perception, consciousness, and free will.

In summary, Sims presents a detailed argument that our agential phenomenology can have libertarian satisfaction conditions by showing that we experience possibilities for action—affordances—which are integrated into our perceptual processes according to modest pragmatism about perception. This perspective challenges the notion that our conscious experiences must be compatible with determinism and provides a nuanced approach to understanding free will in relation to phenomenology.


The text presented is an excerpt from a philosophical paper discussing the nature of agency, perception, and free will, specifically focusing on the concept of affordances - action possibilities offered by the environment. The author aims to argue that conscious experiences involving affordances contradict determinism, supporting libertarian satisfaction conditions for our agential phenomenology (the experience of agency).

1. **Affordances and Perception**: The paper asserts that when we perceive an affordance, such as a bike being rideable, we are consciously experiencing two physical possibilities - the possibility to act (riding the bike) and its negation (not riding the bike). This interpretation is grounded in the semantic content of these experiences.

2. **Modal Content of Affordances**: The author addresses potential objections regarding the modal content of affordance-involving perceptual episodes:
   - *Affordances do not have modal content*: Some might argue that seeing an opportunity for action (e.g., climbing a wall) is simply a conditional or means-end relationship without actual modal content. However, the author counters this by suggesting that such accounts fail to capture the self-involvement necessary for affordances to guide behavior, contradicting their explanatory function.
   - *Affordances have modal content, but it's not physical*: Critics may claim that the possibility in question is metaphysical (incompatible with laws of nature) or nomic (compatible with laws but different from actual outcomes). The author responds by asserting that both are implausible contents for conscious experience. Physical possibilities, on the other hand, align well with our understanding of perception as delivering facts about the physical world and are more compatible with the explanatory role of affordances.
   - *Perceiving ◊w does not entail that I perceive ◊¬w*: Another objection suggests that seeing a possibility for action only involves perceiving one future (actual) alongside cognitive judgment about another possibility. The author argues this doesn't apply to non-conceptual, syntactically unstructured affordance-involving experiences, which likely perceive multiple simultaneous possibilities due to their "here-and-now" centered structure.

3. **Conclusion and Limitations**: Despite the presented argument, the author clarifies that it does not establish libertarianism's truth but rather argues for a libertarian content in our agential phenomenology. To further support libertarianism, an additional argument from presumptive veridicality (assuming experiences accurately reflect reality) would be required. The author also mentions Deery's suggestion of multiple contents within experiences, where one content could correspond to non-actualizable properties while the other content tracks instantiated relevant properties during free will experiences, allowing for a libertarian experience without committing to libertarianism as metaphysical truth.

The author concludes that our agential phenomenology might involve representations of action possibilities conflicting with determinism, suggesting it warrants more rigorous consideration in philosophical debates about free will and perception.


### 17-Simulation trouble

Title: Simulation Trouble - Shaun Gallagher

The article "Simulation Trouble" by Shaun Gallagher, published in Social Neuroscience (2007), presents arguments against both explicit and implicit versions of the simulation theory for intersubjective understanding. 

1. Explicit Simulation:
Gallagher argues that this version of simulation theory faces logical and phenomenological challenges. Logically, it's questioned how a simulation based on one's own narrow experience can reliably represent diverse behaviors in others. Phenomenologically, there's no evidence from everyday experiences showing that we consciously employ such imaginative, introspective simulation routines when understanding others. 

2. Implicit (Subpersonal) Simulation:
Implicit ST, based on neuroscience, particularly mirror neuron research, suggests that understanding others involves subconscious, automatic processes. While this version doesn't violate phenomenological observations as it posits unconscious mental operations, Gallagher argues it fails to meet crucial constraints of simulation theory. 

Key points about implicit simulation:
- Neuroscience evidence shows that when we observe others performing intentional actions, our motor system 'resonates' or mimics the observed action (mirror neuron activity). 
- These processes are automatic, unconscious, and non-reflective, suggesting an immediate, reflex-like understanding of observed actions. 

Criticisms against implicit simulation:
- Despite strong neuroscientific evidence, Gallagher questions whether it's appropriate to characterize these subpersonal mechanisms as 'simulations.' 
- Even if they are, the theory struggles to explain how we attribute mental states different from our own to others, which is a fundamental aspect of intersubjective understanding. 

Gallagher proposes an alternative view, based on developmental psychology, neuroscience, and phenomenology: 
- From infancy, humans understand conspecifics directly through perception of emotional expressions, actions, gestures without needing to infer hidden mental states (primary intersubjectivity).
- Around age 1, we develop capacities for shared attention, understanding others within pragmatic contexts (secondary intersubjectivity), engaging in second-person interactions.
- Narrative competence from around age 3 or 4 further enhances our understanding of others by framing interpretations using proto-narratives or narrative practices. 

This alternative approach suggests that perceptual, emotional, pragmatic capacities for interaction, alongside narrative competence, are sufficient to explain everyday social understanding without resorting to mental state theories (theory theory) or simulation theories.


The text discusses criticisms of the Theory of Mind (ToM), specifically the implicit version that relies on subpersonal simulation, such as mirror neuron activation. The author argues against the claim that these neural processes constitute genuine simulation according to the standard definition in Theory of Mind (ToM) literature.

1. **Pretense and Instrumental Use**: ToM theory posits that simulation involves a first-person, controlled use of a model to understand another person's mental state. However, subpersonal mirror neuron activation lacks this control and instrumentality because it is not something we consciously initiate or manipulate. These neural activations are passively elicited by the other person's actions, not actively 'used' in the way ST requires.

2. **Lack of Pretense**: Mirror neuron activity does not involve pretending to be in another’s situation (pretense). ST's definition necessitates that simulators 'put themselves in someone else's shoes,' which mirror neurons do not do. They fire neutrally, without differentiating between self and other.

3. **Minimal Simulation Condition**: Goldman and Sripada propose a minimal condition for simulation: the state ascribed to another must be instantiated, experienced, or undergone by the observer. Yet, even this minimal condition isn't met by mirror neuron activation alone; additional processes of 'classification' and 'projection' are needed for full-fledged mind reading (attributing mental states).

4. **Discrepancy with Observed Behavior**: We often understand and attribute different feelings or actions to others without matching our own states, contradicting the notion that understanding another's mental state requires simulating it closely. 

The author concludes by suggesting there is no necessary isomorphism between phenomenological experience, functional processes, and neuronal activity. This challenge to the implicit simulation view argues that mirror neuron activation doesn't fit the ST definition of simulation and may better be understood as part of a direct perceptual process rather than an implicit simulation. 

This debate highlights the complexity in understanding human social cognition, particularly how we attribute mental states to others, and underscores the challenges in translating neuroscientific findings into psychological theory.


The provided text is a scholarly discussion on the Simulation Theory (ST) of mindreading, focusing on the arguments against implicit simulation processes being sufficient for understanding others' mental states. The author, Susan Gallagher, presents several points to challenge the idea that motor resonance systems—which are involved in perceiving and understanding other people's actions—constitute simulations as required by ST.

1. **Cognitive Load Problem**: The author argues that simulating another person's mental state would require an impractical amount of cognitive work, especially when dealing with multiple individuals or complex interpersonal interactions. This is due to the need for a concrete similarity between the simulator's and the simulated subject's states, which leads to an infinite regress if one attempts to understand others through simulation.

2. **Distinction Between Simulation and Emulation**: The text distinguishes between simulation (ST) and motor emulation processes in neuroscience. While the latter are used for action planning and prediction, they do not meet the criteria of ST as they lack an "as if" component that signifies pretending to be in another's shoes. Instead, motor emulations merely activate shared representations within one's own neural system.

3. **Example of Woman Reaching for a Snake**: The author uses this example to illustrate the contrast between her repulsion and the woman's enthusiasm for handling snakes. According to Gallagher, this difference in reactions suggests that understanding others is not solely based on simulating their mental states but may involve enactive perceptual processes that activate shared representations. These shared representations could generate a motoric emulation of the observed action within one's own neural system, which contributes to personal feelings rather than direct simulation of another's mental state.

4. **Implicit vs. Explicit Simulation**: The author contends that implicit ST cannot fully account for our primary and pervasive ability to understand others since it is a relatively rare phenomenon. In contrast, explicit simulations might be redundant if implicit processes were sufficient. Moreover, relying solely on implicit simulation would mean that we lack an adequate mechanism for dealing with situations requiring higher-order understanding or narrative competence.

5. **Role of Perception and Narrative**: Gallagher suggests that our perceptual access to the contextualized bodily movements, gestures, facial expressions, etc., provides a partial understanding of others' intentions. However, this understanding is still relatively elemental. A fuller account of intersubjectivity requires considering language and narrative competencies alongside these perceptual processes.

In conclusion, the author argues that implicit simulation processes do not meet the criteria required by ST to explain our ability to understand others' mental states. Instead, she proposes a more nuanced view that incorporates enactive perceptual processes and narrative competencies in accounting for intersubjectivity. The primary role of motor resonance systems is to contribute to the constitution of perceptual access to others' intentions rather than to perform simulations as required by ST.


### 17-The Phenomenology of Attention in Julian of Norwich_s A Revelation of Love

In Julian of Norwich's "A Revelation of Love," attention is portrayed as a crucial aspect of spiritual experience, encompassing both beseeching (anticipating) and beholding (retaining). The essay by Michael Raby examines these two forms of attentiveness in the context of Julian's mystical theology.

1. Beseeching: This form of attention involves seeking or yearning for God, an act that is voluntary yet rooted in divine will. Julian's desire to remain in her "deadly body" signifies her refusal to subordinate bodily sight to spiritual sight. The necessity of clearing space for the arrival of God is echoed in Augustine's teachings on intentio (attention) as a leather purse stretched by desire. Prayer and beseeching loosen and stretch the soul, making it receptive to God's grace. This process entails vulnerability, as Julian experiences pain while suffering with Christ and must discern whether her "sterings" (arousals or changes of direction) are from God or other sources.

2. Beholding: In contrast to beseeching, which looks forward, beholding activates the retentional aspect of attention. It involves holding onto recent perceptions and memories while still being actively attentive in the present moment. Julian's attention stretches to keep both ghostly and bodily visions in mind simultaneously, creating a sense of "coincidence and overlap." Beholding is generative, as present perceptions activate sedimented or forgotten retentions based on similarities (associative awakening). For example, Julian's beholding of Christ's dripping blood leads to analogical associations with other objects.

In both forms of attention, Julian practices a phenomenological approach that foregrounds her own attentiveness and the process by which she receives revelations. She emphasizes the gratuity of God's appearing and the importance of discernment in distinguishing divine from non-divine stirrings or arousals. Julian's understanding of attention highlights the complex interplay between will, desire, and divine intervention, challenging simplistic oppositions between premodern contemplation and modern distraction.


The passage discusses Michael Raby's essay titled "The Phenomenology of Attention in Julian of Norwich's A Revelation of Love," which explores the concept of attention in the context of Julian of Norwich's mystical writings. The author argues that Norwich's work demonstrates a nuanced understanding of attention, emphasizing its role in spiritual growth and communion with the divine.

1. **Two-stage understanding of memory**: Raby suggests that Norwich implies a two-stage process of memory. Initially, there is the mere storage of sensory details (like the color or placement of objects). The second stage involves an emotional and symbolic interpretation of these details. In the case of Julian's vision of the lord and servant, while the visual elements remain constant, her understanding of their significance evolves over time.

2. **Mental networks and beholding**: Raby uses Mary Carruthers' framework to explain how Julian constructs 'mental networks' or patterns of association through repeated contemplation and divine assistance. This process allows her to imbue "misty" images with deeper meaning, akin to bringing a spark to life by striking flint against steel.

3. **Reciprocal structure of beholding**: The essay notes the reciprocal nature of Julian's beholding – she is both passive (held by what she sees) and active (choosing to look upon Christ). This dynamic highlights the interplay between divine guidance and human intentionality in her spiritual journey.

4. **Pain as a distraction**: The essay delves into Julian's struggle with pain, both physical and emotional. It argues that while she advocates setting aside such discomforts, she acknowledges their potency in drawing attention away from spiritual contemplation. Raby suggests that Julian's inability to ignore bodily pain during her revelations is a critical factor in her lapses of focus.

5. **Unpredictable nature of revelations**: The essay also discusses how the discontinuous and unpredictable nature of Norwich's visions challenges the gathering movement of attention. Unexpected shifts can leave her behind, requiring her to catch up with Christ's teachings or movements within the vision.

6. **Attention as a balancing act**: Raby emphasizes Julian's awareness of the limitations of human attention compared to divine omniscience. She models attentiveness by focusing on what is given and patiently waiting for further revelation, encouraging her readers to do the same.

7. **Historical context and influences**: The essay situates Norwich's understanding of attention within broader medieval contexts, referencing phenomenological philosophers like Heidegger and Augustine. It also discusses how Norwich navigates tensions between the 'bodily' and 'ghostly' aspects of her visions, blending them in a complex interplay of sensory detail and spiritual insight.

In summary, Raby's essay elucidates Julian of Norwich's sophisticated understanding of attention as it manifests in her mystical experiences and writings. It highlights the dynamic interplay between passive reception and active engagement, the role of memory and interpretation, and the challenges posed by physical and emotional distractions (especially pain) to sustained spiritual contemplation. The essay also underscores Norwich's innovative approach to attention within broader philosophical and religious traditions of her time.

### 17-Toward a phenomenology of taking care

Title: Toward a phenomenology of taking care

Authors: Christophe Coupé & Magali Ollagnier-Beldame

Journal: International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being

The article focuses on understanding the subjective experience of caregivers during their initial encounter with a patient, with the aim of developing a comprehensive "phenomenology of care." The authors argue that despite extensive training for healthcare professionals, there is limited exploration of the lived experiences involved in providing care.

Key Points:

1. The importance of understanding the subjective experience of caregivers: By examining the lived experience of caregiving, one can build stronger relationships with patients and improve overall care quality. This is particularly relevant amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted the critical role of healthcare workers and the challenges they face.

2. Micro-phenomenological interviews: To investigate the lived experience of caregivers during their first meeting with a patient, the authors employ micro-phenomenological interviews—a method that focuses on fine-grained, first-person descriptions of holistic experiences in specific situations.

3. Structuring the subjective experience: The study reveals how the lived experience of meeting a new patient can be structured into categories of micro-experiential acts (such as gathering information and assessing/performing actions), their scopes involving inner and outer perceptions, various elaborations, regulations, and interventions, and a range of experiential modalities.

4. Relevance of the caregiver-patient relationship: The authors emphasize that establishing and maintaining an effective intersubjective relationship between the caregiver and patient is crucial for successful care delivery across various healthcare professions. This relationship is linked to medical outcomes, adherence to treatment, and therapeutic efficacy.

5. First-person perspective and epistemology: The article highlights that studying lived experiences requires a specific epistemology. A first-person approach considers subjectivity as experienced by the individual and embraces both first-person (direct, immediate) and second-person perspectives. This allows for precise description and reflexive analysis of experiences, fostering learning that can transform caregivers' perceptions and attitudes towards future patients.

6. Micro-phenomenological interview method: To collect data, the authors employed micro-phenomenological interviews (also known as explicitation interviews), a technique developed by Pierre Vermersch that focuses on lived experience rather than social representations. This method relies on guided retrospective introspection and the Husserlian epoché, which involves suspending one's "realist" prejudice about the world to better access past experiences.

In summary, this research aims to deepen understanding of caregivers' subjective experiences during initial patient encounters through micro-phenomenological interviews. The study seeks to outline a phenomenology of care that transcends professional boundaries and could lead to improved care delivery by emphasizing the importance of reflexive practice, experiential knowledge, and the intersubjective relationship between caregivers and patients.


The text describes a qualitative research study conducted by C. Coupé and M. Ollagnier-Beldame on the experience of healthcare professionals during their first encounter with a new patient. The methodology used is micro-phenomenological interviews, which aim to collect detailed, first-person descriptions of singular lived experiences.

The researchers collected data from 13 healthcare professionals (speech therapists, family medicine practitioners, dentist, physiotherapist, and psychotherapists) through audio-recorded interviews conducted in their workplaces or research institution meeting rooms. The interviews were around 45 to 90 minutes long, with a total recording duration of 14 hours, 7 minutes, and 42 seconds. Out of these, 10 interviews were fully transcribed.

The interview technique emphasizes introspection and the "embodied posture of speech" to facilitate recall of past experiences without inducing false or distorted memories. The researchers used a limited set of question frames focusing on feelings, perceptions, actions, and temporal articulations to encourage detailed descriptions of experiences rather than generalizations or opinions.

The analytical approach involves several steps: inserting identifiers before interviewer and interviewee's interventions in the transcriptions, removing aborted sentences and repetitions, keeping experiential descriptions, discarding non-experiential pieces of information, organizing content chronologically into key moments, and finally shifting from the chronology of the interview to that of the experience.

The researchers used a model of action (Faingold, 1997; Vermersch, 1994) as a guide to describe the caregiver's experience in four steps: gathering information, identifying the situation, making a decision, and carrying out actions. However, they found that the third step was often implicit and decided to focus on three categories of acts performed by the caregiver: 'Gathering Information', 'Assessing', and 'Performing Actions'.

These categories were further broken down into scopes or dimensions, such as sources (outer information about the patient, inner information about oneself or the other), and modalities (visual, auditory, tactile, extra-sensory, feelings, inner speech, outer speech, motor activity, embodied judgements).

The study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the micro-components of the caregivers' experience during their first meeting with a patient. This detailed characterization of possible micro-experiences serves as the foundation for a deeper exploration and investigation of these phenomena in healthcare contexts.


The text presents a study on the subjective experience of caregivers during their initial meetings with patients, employing micro-phenomenology as the research method. This approach aims to understand the pre-reflective aspects of consciousness, which are not yet conscious but accessible through careful guidance by a trained interviewer.

The study identifies various dimensions and objects of attention in these caregiver-patient interactions:

1. **Acts**: These refer to the actions or behaviors exhibited by the caregiver during the encounter. They include gathering outer information, assessing, regulating one's activity, etc. The list of acts is not exhaustive but rather illustrative of the diversity in caregiver behavior.

2. **Experiential Modalities**: These are the ways in which caregivers perceive and process the information gathered from their patients. Examples include inner speech (e.g., "ah, there's going to be something dynamic"), motor activity (e.g., opening a door), embodied judgment (e.g., sensing a good impression), and others.

3. **Objects of Attention**: These are the aspects of the patient and the situation that the caregiver focuses on. They include identity markers (like names, appearance), physical and vocal expressions, dynamism, internal states, motives for consultation, setting, relationship to the other, etc.

The study reveals that caregivers project various things onto their patients within the clinical relationship, a process similar to countertransference in psychotherapy. This projection can influence diagnosis and therapeutic alliance formation. 

Moreover, the authors emphasize that caregiving is a finalized activity, meaning it's focused on achieving specific goals (like making a diagnosis or building a therapeutic alliance). The process involves both productive and constructive aspects: gathering information, assessing, and constructing professional expertise over time.

The research also underscores the challenges caregivers face in today's hyper-regulated healthcare systems, which can negatively impact their ability to 'truly encounter' patients due to time constraints, stress, and routine-based interactions. 

Finally, the study suggests that fostering reflexivity in caregivers—encouraging them to reflect on their experiences, sensations, feelings, and thoughts—could enhance the quality of care and support caregivers' wellbeing. This could involve using analytical data from experiential research during training to help caregivers understand their behavior patterns better and fine-tune their skills. 

In conclusion, this micro-phenomenological study provides valuable insights into the subtle, pre-reflective aspects of caregiver-patient interactions, offering potential avenues for improving caregiving practices and training programs.


This text presents a study on the caregiver's experience during encounters with patients, focusing on their actions, experiential modalities, and the application of a Focusing and Person-centered Approach. The research was conducted by Christophe Coupé and Magali Ollagnier-Beldame, with contributions from Anne Cazemajou in interview analysis.

**Key findings:**
1. **Categories of acts**: Caregivers perform several types of acts during encounters:
   - Gathering information: Both outer (about the patient) and inner (on themselves or the other). Examples include noticing a person's demeanor or feeling an internal heat in one's head.
   - Assessing: Self-evaluation, evaluation of others, the relationship between caregiver and patient, and the overall situation. For instance, assessing that the upcoming interaction will be dynamic based on initial impressions.
   - Performing actions: Regulating their behavior (e.g., maintaining a reassuring attitude) and intervening in the encounter by actively listening or noticing non-verbal cues like handshakes.

2. **Experiential modalities**: Caregivers use various experiential channels to gather information about patients:
   - Visual: Noting facial expressions, eye contact, and overall appearance. Example: "His gaze was alert with clear, bright eyes; it wasn't lifeless."
   - Auditory: Perceiving speech patterns or articulation issues. Example: "I perceived at that moment that he had a severe articulatory disorder."
   - Tactile: Observing non-verbal gestures like handshakes. Example: "I actually pay attention to the handshake."
   - Extra-sensory: Sensing intangible qualities, such as the absence of substance or physical presence in others. Example: "He doesn't exist... If I tried to touch him there would be no texture; it would fall apart or be a ghost, and I would pass through it."
   - Feelings: Internal sensations related to patients' physical states, like relaxation or tension. Example: "I feel that the arms relax, and even that the shoulders relax, with an opening near the clavicles."
   - Inner speech: Self-talk during encounters. Example: "I tell myself 'ah' there's going to be something dynamic."
   - Outer speech: Verbal communication with patients. Example: "I say ok I am ready to work with you about the rape."
   - Motor activity: Physical actions like opening doors, which can reflect caregivers' attitudes or intentions.
   - Embodied judgment: Global impressions of others based on non-verbal cues and intuition.

3. **Application of Focusing and Person-centered Approach**: The study highlights the importance of understanding and valuing caregivers' experiential processes in their encounters with patients. This approach encourages empathy, self-awareness, and a patient-centered focus on caregiver-patient relationships, which can lead to better therapeutic outcomes.

**Implications**: By integrating these findings into healthcare training and practice, clinicians may develop more attuned, effective, and empathetic approaches in their interactions with patients, ultimately improving the quality of care and support provided during challenging situations like managing dementia or coping with crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.


### 18-Calculativeness and trust_ A view from phenomenology

Title: Calculativeness and trust: A view from phenomenology
Author: Morten Frederiksen
Published in: Journal of Trust Research (2014)

The article examines the relationship between calculativeness and trust, focusing on Oliver Williamson's perspective and contrasting it with Knud Ejler Løgstrup's phenomenological theory of trust. The main arguments are as follows:

1. Williamson vs. Løgstrup on trust and calculativeness:
   - Williamson argues that trust is a residual notion, applicable only when risk and calculativeness are minimal or absent in decision-making processes (Williamson, 1993). He considers calculativeness as the default attitude, with trust arising in rare instances.
   - Løgstrup posits that trust is a fundamental category of social existence, functioning as an ongoing process rather than an outcome or level of reflexivity (Løgstrup, 1997). Trust emerges spontaneously from interaction when suspicion is absent.

2. Familiarity and trust:
   - Løgstrup's theory highlights the importance of familiarity in everyday social interactions, suggesting that people often engage without calculating risks due to established, habitual patterns of behavior (Løgstrup, 1997). This differs from Williamson’s view that trust is primarily present in highly familiar relationships.

3. Institutional context and trust/calculativeness:
   - Løgstrup's analysis acknowledges the role of institutions and governance structures, which can be experienced as taken-for-granted, familiarity-inducing features within social interactions (Løgstrup, 1995; Schütz & Luckmann, 1973).
   - Williamson's argument for extending calculativeness into non-market relationships overlooks the influence of networks, culture, and regulation in shaping familiarity, potentially allowing trust to emerge within market contexts (Beckert, 2003; Granovetter, 1985).

4. Concluding thoughts:
   - The article argues that both Williamson's and Løgstrup’s perspectives offer valuable insights into the relationship between calculativeness and trust. A comprehensive understanding requires considering subjective experience, familiarity, and institutional contexts.
   - Future research should focus on empirical investigations of tipping points and phases of transition between calculativeness and trust across various situations, institutions, and previous experiences to better understand the embedded nature of market relations at the level of individual subjectivity.

In summary, this article critically evaluates Williamson's claim that calculativeness is inimical to trust by integrating Løgstrup's phenomenological theory of trust. It highlights how familiarity and institutional contexts play crucial roles in understanding the nature of social interactions, emphasizing the importance of subjective experience when examining trust and calculativeness.


### 18-Mosaic or kaleidoscope_ tensions between mereology and etiology

The article "Mosaic or Kaleidoscope: Tensions between Mereology and Etiology" by Shaun Gallagher discusses the challenges faced by new mechanistic accounts in explaining embodied cognitive neuroscience, particularly concerning the relationship between mereology (the study of parts and wholes) and etiology (causal relations).

Gallagher begins by acknowledging Mougenot & Matheson's argument for the relevance of new mechanist explanations in embodied cognitive neuroscience. However, he focuses on one specific tension within these accounts – the separation between mereological constitution and causal etiology.

In new mechanistic theory, there is a strict distinction made between constitution (where parts compose a whole without causing it) and causality (intra-level processes where parts cause changes in one another). This division is problematic for theories that endorse dynamical causality, as found in ecological and enactive approaches to embodied cognition.

Gallagher identifies two key issues arising from this tension: methodology and the nature of causality itself. The first issue pertains to how interventions or 'interference' tests are used to determine constitutive relations, as suggested by Craver's mutual manipulability approach. However, these methods were initially designed to test for causal relations based on James Woodward’s interventionist theory. This creates a conflict because applying such tests for constitutive relations implies causality between levels (part-whole), which is prohibited in new mechanistic accounts.

The second issue concerns the understanding of causality itself. Traditional linear causality suggests that A causes B if A occurs before and influences B, with time being irreversible. However, some embodied cognition theories propose dynamical, non-linear causality where wholes recursively alter their causing processes, leading to circular or reciprocal causal relations across levels (Kirchhoff, 2017; Krickel, 2017).

Gallagher argues that the conflict between mereology and etiology in new mechanistic accounts becomes more pronounced when considering dynamical constitutive causality. This brings up two main questions: whether explanations require hierarchical mechanistic levels (mosaic view) or can be modeled as level-free, dynamic mechanisms (kaleidoscope view). The latter approach eliminates the need for delineating different levels and treats the mechanism as a complex set of interacting causal factors.

In conclusion, Gallagher highlights the tension between mereological constitution and etiological causality within new mechanistic accounts. He suggests that embracing dynamical causality in embodied cognition theories conflicts with the strict separation of these concepts in new mechanistic theory. Resolving this tension may require either relaxing the mereological assumption of synchrony or redefining constitution as an interlevel, dynamical process that involves causal interactions across different levels.


### 18-Phenomenology and phenomenography in educational research_ A critique

The article by Steven A. Stolz critiques phenomenography as an educational research method, arguing that it departs from its parent philosophical tradition, phenomenology, leading to conceptual confusion and weakening its legitimacy. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Phenomenology**: Stolz begins by outlining the historical context of phenomenology, introduced by Edmund Husserl as a response to the limitations of traditional philosophical inquiry. Phenomenology aims to clarify how the world comes to exist for us through intentional acts of consciousness. It involves bracketing or suspending natural attitudes and assumptions about the world, allowing researchers to reveal the essence of experiences (essences). Husserl's method of reduction helps overcome potential distortions in perception by isolating central structures of consciousness.

2. **Phenomenography**: Marton introduced phenomenography as a distinct research approach, focusing on second-order descriptions (i.e., people's conceptions or experiences of the world) rather than first-order perspectives. Stolz highlights four main differences between phenomenology and phenomenography:

   - **Second-order perspective**: Phenomenography investigates how people experience and conceptualize aspects of the world, while phenomenology focuses on the first-person point of view.
   - **Essence**: Both share an interest in essence but apply it differently; phenomenography aims to uncover qualitatively different ways of experiencing phenomena (modes of experience), whereas phenomenology seeks to reveal the essence of consciousness to understand objects intelligibly.
   - **Subject matter**: Phenomenography investigates the relational, experiential, content-oriented, and qualitative categories of understanding from a second-order perspective, while phenomenology examines the intentional structure of conscious acts.
   - **Data analysis**: Phenomenography relies on the researcher's categorization of subjects' descriptions into modes of experience or outcomes spaces, whereas phenomenology emphasizes bracketing and reduction to uncover essences directly from experiences.

3. **Critique of Phenomenography**: Stolz argues that phenomenography departs from phenomenology in crucial ways, leading to conceptual confusion:

   - **Bracketing and Reduction**: Phenomenography does not employ Husserl's reduction or bracketing method, which is essential for eliminating researcher bias. Stolz contends that phenomenography's failure to bracket assumptions distorts the interpretation of participants' experiences.
   - **Assumptions about human experience**: Phenomenography assumes a limited number of ways people experience phenomena, leading to potential misinterpretations and oversimplifications of complex human experiences.
   - **Researcher's role**: Phenomenography places excessive emphasis on the researcher's interpretation of data, which Stolz argues undermines the participant's authority in shaping their own experience's understanding.

4. **Consolidation within Phenomenology**: To strengthen phenomenography, Stolz suggests aligning it more closely with phenomenological principles and methods:

   - Embrace Husserl's reduction and bracketing to minimize researcher bias and enhance the rigor of interpretations.
   - Adopt a more nuanced understanding of human experience, acknowledging its complexity and avoiding oversimplification into predetermined categories.
   - Encourage interdisciplinary dialogue between phenomenography and other phenomenological traditions to refine methods and deepen theoretical foundations.

In conclusion, Stolz argues that phenomenography should be more closely integrated with its philosophical roots in phenomenology to enhance its legitimacy as an educational research method. By incorporating essential phenomenological principles like reduction and bracketing, phenomenography can better capture the complexity of human experiences while minimizing researcher bias.


The text discusses a critical perspective on phenomenography, an educational research approach developed by Finnish educational psychologist Etienne W. Marton. Phenomenography aims to describe different ways individuals experience or conceive a particular concept or phenomenon, often within the context of learning. The author argues that phenomenography has deviated from its philosophical roots in phenomenology and suffers from several conceptual flaws, which can lead to misinterpretations and confusion in educational research.

The main criticisms raised by the author include:

1. Phenomenography's tendency to use second-order perspectives, where researchers interpret students' experiences rather than directly observing them. This methodology allows personal biases and assumptions of the researcher to influence findings, which contradicts phenomenology's emphasis on bracketing (suspending one's preconceptions) during data analysis.
2. Phenomenography's reliance on "authoritative sources" like textbooks or expert opinions to determine similarity and differences in students' experiences. This can lead to over-reliance on external criteria, resulting in research findings that may appear contrived rather than authentic descriptions of students' lived experiences.
3. Phenomenography's focus on categorizing and hierarchically ordering generalizations about students' conceptions, which the author argues ignores or downplays the first-person perspective and subjective experiences central to phenomenology.
4. The author also points out that phenomenography emphasizes second-order perspectives instead of the first-order (first-person) perspectives typical in phenomenological research, focusing on the variants and modes surrounding intuition (transcendent, eidetic, and immanent).

The author proposes that phenomenography would be strengthened by aligning itself more closely with phenomenological principles, especially regarding methods like bracketing. This alignment could help phenomenographic researchers avoid importing their own beliefs and biases into the analysis of students' experiences. The text offers a detailed summary of phenomenology's methodology as outlined by Edmund Husserl, which emphasizes rigorous steps to access subjective experience, such as phenomenological intuiting, eidetic intuition, essential relationships, and constitution.

In conclusion, the author advocates for phenomenography to either modify its approach or abandon it altogether in favor of integrating it within the broader research agenda of phenomenology, thus benefitting from a disciplined methodology that can analyze lived experiences intersubjectively while ensuring objectivity. The aim is to foster a more accurate understanding of human experience in educational contexts and beyond.


Title: Phenomenological Tools for Educational Research

Phenomenology is a research approach that aims to understand subjective experiences, focusing on how people perceive and make sense of their world. This methodology has been applied in various fields, including education. The following are ten phenomenological tools utilized by phenomenologists:

1. Phenomenological Reduction: This process involves suspending or "bracketing" preconceived notions and assumptions about a particular phenomenon to focus solely on the individual's subjective experience. By doing so, researchers can better understand the essence of an experience without being influenced by external biases.

2. Investigating Particular Phenomena ("Description"): In this tool, phenomenologists meticulously describe and analyze specific experiences or events to uncover their unique characteristics and meanings for individuals. This method aims to capture the nuances of subjective reality by focusing on particular instances rather than generalized concepts.

3. Mereological Analysis: Derived from Aristotle's concept, mereological analysis involves examining wholes (objects or experiences) in terms of their parts and the relationships between these parts. In phenomenology, this tool is used to explore how different components of an experience interrelate and shape overall understanding.

4. Investigating Invariant Structures and Relationships: This method focuses on identifying commonalities or patterns within subjective experiences across individuals. By uncovering invariant structures, researchers can develop a more comprehensive understanding of human phenomena that transcend individual differences.

5. Analyzing Typical/Invariant Modes of Appearing: Phenomenologists study the ways in which phenomena present themselves consistently across experiences to identify the essential features and modes of appearance. This approach can help uncover fundamental characteristics of subjective experiences shared by many individuals.

6. Analyzing Static (Embodied/Kinaesthetic) Constitution of Objects/Experiences: Researchers explore how objects or experiences are perceived in a static, present moment. This includes examining the bodily sensations and kinaesthetic awareness that contribute to an individual's subjective understanding of phenomena.

7. Analyzing Genetic (Embodied/Kinaesthetic) Constitution of Objects/Experience: This tool involves investigating how experiences evolve or develop over time, tracing their origins and progression through the bodily and kinaesthetic dimensions of subjective reality.

8. Hermeneutic Interpretation of the Meaning of Existential Phenomena: Drawing from hermeneutics, phenomenologists interpret the meaning behind existential experiences by considering their cultural, historical, and personal contexts. This method acknowledges that understanding an experience often requires interpreting it within a broader framework of human existence.

9. Interpreting Experimental (Dysfunctional) Data and Explanations: Phenomenologists can analyze experimental data to identify deviations or dysfunctions in subjective experiences. By examining these anomalies, researchers can gain insights into the complexities and nuances of human experience.

10. Interpreting Vicarious Experience and Second-Person Methods in General: This tool involves studying experiences not directly lived by the researcher through second-person methods such as participant observation or interviews with others. These methods enable phenomenologists to explore diverse perspectives on human experience, enriching their understanding of subjective realities.

The contestable nature of phenomenological inquiry has led to ongoing debates among its practitioners, such as the recent discussions between Van Manen (2017) and Smith (2018). These debates highlight the unresolved issues surrounding the application and interpretation of phenomenology within educational research. Therefore, when utilizing phenomenological methods in educational contexts, it is essential to maintain caution and consider the complexities associated with this approach.


### 18-Second Nature_ Critical Theory and Hegel_s Phenomenology

Title: Second Nature, Critical Theory, and Hegel's Phenomenology

In this article, Michael A. Becker explores the concept of 'second nature' in Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's works, focusing on its role in his 1807 Phenomenology of Spirit (PhG). While second nature has been widely discussed in Hegel scholarship, particularly concerning the Encyclopedia and Philosophy of Right, its significance in the PhG remains underexplored.

Becker argues that the phrases 'natural consciousness', 'natural notion', and 'inorganic nature' in the PhG are integral to understanding Hegel's concept of second nature. He proposes that these expressions reveal an 'unoﬃcial' version of second nature, which anticipates its use in critical theory, particularly the Frankfurt School.

1. Introduction: Hegel and Second Nature
Becker discusses the existing literature on second nature, highlighting two main interests: (i) non-reductive situating of human mindedness within a natural order, focusing on habit; and (ii) critical theory's interpretation of second nature as expressing both spirit's socio-historical constitution and its estrangement or 'naturalization' into something seemingly unalterable.

2. Second Nature and Habit (Philosophy of Spirit)
Becker provides an overview of Hegel's official account of second nature from §410 in the Philosophy of Spirit. Here, habit is portrayed as a mechanism that allows a relatively undeveloped self ('soul') to acquire stability against distracting sensations by appropriating and reforming its initial 'first nature' (animal embodiment). This second nature embodies norms and rules through practical repetition, which may eventually become instinctive.

3. Second Nature in Critical Theory
Becker discusses the Frankfurt School's interpretation of second nature, emphasizing their focus on exposing socially constructed 'second natures' that appear as unchangeable 'first natures.' This interpretation, according to Becker, diverges from Hegel's original concept by attributing a critical function to second nature—revealing its false appearance as natural.

4. Natural Consciousness and Non-philosophy (Phenomenology of Spirit)
Becker argues that 'natural consciousness' in the PhG refers to unreflective, spontaneous attitudes with a determinate ground-norm (essence or criterion). These norms are integral to natural consciousness and manifest in observable behavior. Becker suggests that each shape of natural consciousness embodies its ground-norm as instinctively expressed conduct, similar to Hegel's official concept of second nature.

5. Second Nature and Natural Notions
Becker proposes that every 'natural notion' is a deeply held value or belief unaware of its prehistory—its origin in the collapse of another shape's value. This perspective, exclusive to the reader, reveals natural consciousness as misrepresenting its second nature as an abrupt immediacy, hiding its social and historical genesis.

6. The Inorganic Nature of Natural Consciousness
Becker discusses Hegel's use of 'inorganic nature,' suggesting it refers to the way natural consciousness misrepresents its second nature as fixed and unchanging, obscuring its development from other shapes' collapses in the wider cultural context.

In summary, Becker argues that the PhG presents an 'unoﬃcial' version of second nature that diverges from Hegel's official account and prefigures critical theory's interpretations. This concept highlights natural consciousness as embodying norms and misrepresenting them as unchanging, ultimately revealing socially constructed and historically evolving 'second natures.'


The paper by M.A. Becker delves into the concept of "second nature" as presented in Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's Philosophy of Spirit (PhG). The author argues that Hegel's account of second nature encompasses both personal and cultural dimensions, which are part of a broader project of defetishizing critique.

1. **Natural Consciousness**: Becker first introduces the concept of natural consciousness, which identifies with and mistakes its "natural notions" for a given, unmediated reality (first nature). These notions are essentially second nature – habits, norms, or ways of thinking that have been internalized but are not yet subjected to reflective examination.

2. **Second Nature as Habit**: The paper highlights Hegel's use of the term "habit" and "second nature," which denote the internalization of cultural norms and societal expectations. These habits, though often unconscious, are nonetheless real and shape an individual's consciousness and behavior.

3. **Defetishizing Critique**: Becker contends that Hegel employs second nature as part of a broader defetishizing critique, which aims to reveal the historical, cultural underpinnings of what appears immediate or given. This approach unmasks the arbitrary and conditional nature of seemingly natural facts, thereby challenging illusory self-identifications and enabling genuine self-understanding.

4. **Cultural Second Nature**: The author further expands Hegel's conception of second nature to include the full range of culturally-pervasive notions (natürliche Vorstellungen) that characterize a given society. These notions, though habitually compelling for individuals, are ultimately aspects of the universal spirit's past existence and have become "acquired possessions" or inorganic nature.

5. **Externality of Second Nature**: A central question addressed is why second nature initially appears external to consciousness, despite being one's own internalized habits. Becker suggests that this externality stems from the habitual, unreflective identification with these norms – a state Hegel refers to as "self-deception." Only through philosophical self-reflection and critique can individuals recognize their second nature as historically conditioned, thereby internalizing it in a more authentic sense.

6. **Historical Dimension**: The paper also explores the historical dimension of second nature, arguing that contemporary culture preserves characteristics from its past stages, which then influence and shape individual consciousness. This diachronic aspect of second nature highlights the ongoing evolution of cultural norms over time.

In summary, Becker's interpretation of Hegel's PhG reveals a nuanced understanding of second nature that encompasses both personal habits and broader cultural norms. Through this lens, individuals gradually come to recognize their internalized ways of thinking and behaving as historically conditioned, thereby transcending self-deception and achieving genuine self-understanding. This defetishizing critique is central to Hegel's broader philosophical project, which aims to reveal the underlying historical and cultural dimensions of apparent immediacies.


The text appears to be a part of an academic paper or book chapter, specifically discussing Hegel's philosophy as interpreted by Michael A. Becker (2018). Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Self-Understanding and Rationality**: The author argues that self-understandings in Hegel's Phenomenology are rational because they can be articulated as normative truth-claims, i.e., statements about how things ought to be or are meant to be. This rationality increases over time, as each subsequent self-understanding retains the 'truth-content' of its predecessors (para. 52).

2. **Inheritance from Goethe's Faust**: Förster (2012) reveals that Hegel borrowed the concept of 'inheritance' or 'taking possession' from Goethe's Faust I (para. 53), implying an intertextual relationship between these works.

3. **Supporting Argument**: The author cites his own article ('On Immanent Critique in Hegel's Phenomenology', Becker, 2018) for a detailed justification of this interpretation (para. 54). This suggests that the current text is a part of a broader argument developed in the cited paper.

4. **Acknowledgements and Disclosure**: The author acknowledges Jay Bernstein, two anonymous reviewers from International Journal of Philosophical Studies, Thomas Khurana, Frederick Neuhouser, Andreja Novakovic, and Cæcilie Varslev-Pedersen for their contributions to the paper (para. 52). They also declare no potential conflict of interest (para. 54).

The references provided are scholarly works related to Hegel's philosophy, Adorno's critical theory, and other relevant philosophical texts, demonstrating the academic context of this discussion.

In summary, Becker is exploring how self-understandings in Hegel's Phenomenology evolve rationally while retaining elements from previous stages. This evolution and its rationality are linked to Goethe's Faust through an argument made by Förster. The current text is part of a larger argument developed in Becker's 2018 article, and it places Hegel's thought within broader philosophical discussions.


### 18-The Existential Phenomenology of Transactional Analysis

The article by John Nuttall explores the existential phenomenology of Transactional Analysis (TA) as proposed by its founder, Eric Berne. While Berne did not explicitly reference existential philosophy in his popular writings, Nuttall argues that TA's core concepts can be seen as reflecting an existential-phenomenological attitude.

1. **Existential Phenomenology**: This school of thought combines existential philosophy and phenomenological inquiry. Its origins can be traced back to the pre-Socratics, I Ching, Upanishads, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and Jaspers. Existential phenomenology aims to understand human experience in order to make sense of it, emphasizing freedom, responsibility, and the anxiety that comes with these aspects.

2. **Heidegger's Dasein**: Martin Heidegger introduced the ontological concept of "Being-there" (Dasein), characterized by being thrown into the world, having to cope with life's vicissitudes, and being entangled with others. He described this state as 'Being-with' others, leading to mediocrity and everydayness (fallen-ness) when Dasein evades autonomous, responsible interaction.

3. **Capacities of Dasein**: Dasein has several capacities that allow it to manage existence: mood or emotional state, self-reflection, and discourse or the articulation of intelligibility. These capacities help formulate actions and plans for the future, shaping one's project or possibilities-for-Being-in-the-world.

4. **Daseinsanalysis and Logo-Therapy**: Heidegger's ideas influenced European psychotherapies like Daseinsanalysis (Binswanger and Boss) and logo-therapy (Frankl). These approaches were later popularized in the US by Rollo May, resulting in existential therapies that focus on confronting existential anxiety to achieve authenticity.

5. **TA's Existential Phenomenological Connections**:

   - **Transactions and Intersubjectivity**: TA views transactions as basic units of recognition (strokes) between individuals, highlighting the intersubjective nature of human existence from the start. This aligns with Merleau-Ponty's concept of intersubjectivity and Heidegger's Being-in-the-world-with-others.
   
   - **Ego States and Being-in-the-World**: TA's ego states (Parent, Adult, Child) can be seen as representations of Heidegger's 'Being-in-the-world.' These states reflect how individuals cope with life forces and relationships.
   
   - **Games and Inauthenticity**: In TA, games are patterns that mask inauthentic Being or bad faith (Sartre), revealing how people avoid taking responsibility for their lives.
   
   - **Script and Existential Project**: The TA concept of script can be linked to the existential project, representing an individual's chosen life direction based on possibilities-for-Being-in-the-world.

6. **Therapeutic Relationship**: Both TA and existential therapies value an I-Thou relationship (Buber), emphasizing authenticity and openness to the experience of meeting others, allowing clients to move towards living more authentically within their existential reality.

In conclusion, Nuttall argues that Transactional Analysis can be understood as a systematic phenomenology embracing an existential outlook, describing human existence at both ontic (individual) and ontological levels.


The text discusses the application of existential phenomenology to transactional analysis (TA), focusing on the concepts of strokes, life positions, ego states, and scripts. 

1. Strokes: These are units of recognition or acknowledgment that humans seek from others. They can be verbal or nonverbal, such as a greeting, an inquiry about well-being, or a simple touch. In TA, strokes are crucial for mental and physical health, as they validate our existence and foster interpersonal connections.

2. Life Positions: These are fundamental ways of viewing oneself and others that develop during early childhood. Eric Berne (1972/1992) identified four basic life positions: "I'm OK, You're OK," "I'm Not OK, You're OK," "I'm OK, You're Not OK," and "I'm Not OK, You're Not OK." These positions shape our relating patterns and influence how we perceive ourselves in relation to others.

3. Ego States: TA posits three ego states—Parent, Adult, and Child—that represent learned patterns of feeling, thinking, and behaving, based on significant relationships from early life. The Parent state embodies ingrained attitudes from caregivers; the Child state reflects childhood experiences and adaptations; and the Adult state represents rational, logical thought and decision-making. These ego states can manifest in games—repetitive ulterior transactions aimed at reinforcing one's life position to gain approval or manipulate outcomes.

4. Scripts: Scripts are life plans based on childhood decisions that are reinforced by parents, justified by subsequent events, and culminate in chosen alternatives. They represent an individual's way of being-in-the-world and can limit personal growth if they're inauthentic or self-limiting. The script is influenced by one's life position and ego states, as well as the cultural context in which it develops.

5. Games: These are repetitive, ulterior transactions played out of awareness to affirm a person's life position and ego states. They involve a con (ostensible intention), gimmick (hidden agenda), response (action taken based on the con), switch (change in the interaction), cross-up (misunderstanding or confusion), and payoff (emotional reward). Games often reinforce inauthenticity, as individuals play them to avoid existential anxiety.

6. Bad Faith: Drawing from Jean-Paul Sartre's concept, TA recognizes bad faith as a form of inauthenticity where individuals deny their freedom and responsibility by pretending to be something they are not. This is exemplified through games played from the Child or Parent ego states to maintain control over interpersonal relationships.

7. Therapeutic Process: The therapeutic process in TA aims to help clients reflect on their life positions, ego states, and scripts so that they can recognize patterns of bad faith and inauthenticity. By becoming aware of these dynamics, individuals can work towards more authentic ways of being-in-the-world, leading to improved mental and physical health.

In summary, this text elucidates the connections between existential phenomenology and transactional analysis by exploring how life positions, ego states, scripts, and games shape an individual's way of relating to others and coping with existence. The central theme is that understanding these dynamics can facilitate personal growth and well-being.


The text provided is a scholarly article discussing the intersection of existential philosophy and transactional analysis, specifically focusing on the case of a client named Peter. 

Existential therapy emphasizes four fundamental givens that are central to human existence: death, freedom, isolation, and meaninglessness. These concepts resonate deeply with individuals living with HIV, as described by Milton (1997). The article argues that existential therapy is particularly pertinent for such clients due to the pervasive experience of these givens in their lives.

The case study presented focuses on Peter, who initially presents with depressive anxiety. This anxiety stems from his existential predicament - a sense of 'not-Being-its-self', which is rooted in his life script and fear of making decisions about the future. His history of losing loved ones and starting antiviral therapy serve as reminders of this facetiousness (Shelby, 1995).

As therapy progresses, the author describes how therapeutic techniques from both transactional analysis and existential therapy are employed. The therapist aims to foster a genuine I-Thou relationship with Peter, characterized by mutuality and authenticity. This is in line with Buber's (1970) concept of I-Thou relationships, which prioritize the unique, individual experience over objectification.

The therapeutic process involves helping Peter become more aware of his life position and script, leading to anxiety as he confronts fundamental existential questions about identity and meaning. The therapist's role is to support this exploration without trying to 'fix' or change the client directly, adhering to Deurzen-Smith's (1990) assertion that existential therapists resist changing the client. Instead, growth comes from within the client as they begin to recognize their inner aspirations and freedom.

The author also highlights similarities between Berne's transactional analysis and existential philosophy. Both approaches appreciate the phenomenological aspect of understanding individual experience subjectively. However, unlike some other therapeutic systems, existential therapy does not impose specific models or techniques but encourages flexibility and adaptation based on the unique situation of each client.

In conclusion, this article posits that transactional analysis has an inherent existential underpinning, with its ontological framework and focus on understanding human being-in-the-world aligning closely with key principles of existential philosophy. The author suggests that further exploration could lead to a richer integration between these two perspectives within psychotherapy practice.


### 19-Conscious thinking and cognitive phenomenology_ topics_ views and future developments

The article by Marta Jorba and Dermot Moran discusses the topic of cognitive phenomenology, which focuses on understanding the experiential or phenomenal character of conscious thinking. The authors explore this question within philosophy (both analytic and phenomenological traditions), cognitive psychology, and consciousness studies.

1. **Historical context**: While the nature of conscious thought has been explored in philosophical discussions for centuries, the specific focus on its phenomenal character (cognitive phenomenology) is relatively recent. It emerged as a distinct debate in the 1990s and gained traction with edited volumes in 2011 and 2016.

2. **Topics and views**:

   - **Phenomenal contrast argument**: This approach presents cases where varying specific elements while keeping others constant reveals a distinct phenomenological feature, suggesting the existence of cognitive phenomenology. For instance, understanding an ambiguous sentence or intuiting a mathematical proof might not be explained by sensory or emotional experiences alone.

   - **Epistemic arguments**: These arguments propose that a distinctive phenomenal character is necessary for certain cognitive functions, like distinguishing between thoughts and other mental states, identifying the thought that p from q, and recognizing sudden realizations (insights). Critics argue that alternative accounts can explain these capacities without invoking cognitive phenomenology.

   - **Introspection**: The debate on cognitive phenomenology often hinges on introspective evidence regarding the contents or attitudes of thoughts. However, skepticism about the reliability of introspection has grown, questioning whether introspection can definitively reveal cognitive phenomenology.

   - **Ontology and temporal character**: Some argue that thoughts lack the processive character required to be part of the stream of consciousness, suggesting they might not bear phenomenal characteristics. Others contend that this ontological argument is flawed or misunderstands the nature of cognitive experiences.

   - **Intentionality**: Cognitive phenomenology also intersects with discussions on intentionality in thought and language. Some propose that certain aspects of judgment, such as conviction or certainty, have a specific phenomenal character, while others argue these attitudinal features can be explained by sensory, emotional, or epistemic feelings.

   - **Inner speech**: Debates also revolve around the role of inner speech in conscious thinking and its associated phenomenology. Some propose that inner speech accounts for most conscious thinking's phenomenal character, while others argue that non-linguistic thought processes might also exhibit distinct phenomenal features.

   - **Agency**: The agential aspect of conscious thinking is another area of interest. Questions arise about the nature and extent of a sense of agency in cognitive experiences and how this relates to broader epistemological and metaphysical issues concerning consciousness.

3. **Future developments**: Jorba and Moran propose four areas for future research:
   - The self and self-awareness
   - Attention
   - Emotions and their relation to cognitive phenomenology
   - General theories of consciousness, including how cognitive phenomenology fits within broader accounts of experiential character

The authors also introduce six articles in this special issue that engage with various aspects of the cognitive phenomenology debate and connect it to different areas of philosophical investigation.


The provided text is a section of a scholarly article discussing the phenomenology of cognitive experiences, focusing on thought, within the broader context of philosophical debates about consciousness and its phenomenal character. The authors, Marta Jorba and Dermot Moran, outline various perspectives and arguments related to cognitive phenomenology, which explores whether thoughts or mental states have a distinct phenomenal character, similar to sensory experiences.

1. **Conceptual Contribution of Thought in Phenomenology**: Anders Nes (2012) posits that conceptual content plays a constitutive role in phenomenology by providing thematic unity across sensory, cognitive, and affective states associated with thoughts.

2. **Holistic Cognitive Experience**: Chudnoff (2013) suggests that the experience of mathematical thought is dependent on the holistic cognitive experience of grasping a proof. This perspective highlights the interconnectedness of various mental processes involved in understanding and engaging with abstract concepts.

3. **Cognitive Phenomenology Across Domains**: Jorba (2016) expands on Husserlian insights to argue that cognitive phenomenology can encompass broader domains of mental experiences, such as episodes of thinking and the horizons of possibilities they open. Similarly, Hopp (2016) examines "horizons" and "empty intentions," which are mental acts pointing towards other aspects or perspectives of an experience, thus being considered part of cognitive phenomenology.

4. **Cognitive Phenomenology in Perception**: Bayne and Montague (2011) discuss the possibility of high-level perceptual properties (e.g., recognizing objects like a tree) having a phenomenal character similar to thought processes. Chudnoff (2016) explores moral perceptions as instances of low-level intuition, contributing an argument for cognitive phenomenology views in this domain.

5. **Phenomenological Description**: Smith (2011) outlines three types of consciously thinking based on the object directed at: thinking about seen objects, everyday thoughts regarding current events, and thinking about abstract objects. This work focuses on key structures such as intentionality, phenomenal character, inner awareness, spatiotemporality, and embodiment in cognitive experiences. Crowell (2016), drawing on Heidegger, presents a phenomenology of thinking as a way of being in which meaning is experienced as at issue.

6. **Value and Conscious Thought**: Siewert (1998) suggests a connection between value and conscious thought, while Strawson (2011) constructs an argument for the existence of cognitive phenomenology by claiming that life's interestingness implies the presence of cognitive experiences. Chudnoff (2015) argues there is a gap in Strawson's argument and proposes additional premises on value differences to support cognitive phenomenology.

7. **Future Developments**: Jorba and Moran identify several under-explored topics related to cognitive phenomenology: (i) The self and self-awareness, including the mineness of thought; (ii) Attention's role in conscious thinking; (iii) Emotions and epistemic feelings with a distinct phenomenal character; and (iv) Relation to general theories of consciousness.

The provided text sets the stage for a Special Issue focusing on cognitive phenomenology, discussing various aspects such as phenomenal character in thought, connections with self-awareness, attention, emotions, and general theories of consciousness. The authors then introduce individual articles from that issue, each contributing to these debates through diverse perspectives and methodologies.


The provided references encompass a range of scholarly works that delve into the philosophical study of consciousness, particularly focusing on cognitive phenomenology. Here's a detailed summary of each author's contribution:

1. **Galen Strawson (2008) - Real Materialism and Other Essays**
   In this book, Strawson argues for a form of materialism regarding consciousness, maintaining that mental states are identical to brain states. He rejects dualistic views which posit a non-physical mind and challenges certain aspects of reductive physicalism, particularly the idea of 'inner' versus 'outer'. Instead, Strawson proposes "Real Materialism," asserting that consciousness is simply a part of the physical world, albeit one we're not yet fully able to scientifically explain.

2. **Galen Strawson (2011) - "Cognitive Phenomenology: Real Life"**
   This essay appears in the edited volume "Cognitive Phenomenology." Here, Strawson discusses cognitive phenomenology, which is concerned with the experiential aspects of thinking. He argues for a view that mental images are not necessary for thought and that much cognition occurs without explicit imagery or inner speech. He contends that our everyday experiences of thinking can be accounted for by real materialism—the idea that thoughts are brain processes.

3. **Giulio Tononi (2007) - "The Information Integration Theory of Consciousness"**
   In this chapter from the 'Blackwell Companion to Consciousness', Tononi presents his Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness. According to IIT, consciousness arises from the integrated information within a system—the more information a system integrates, the higher its level of consciousness. This theory attempts to provide an objective, quantifiable measure for understanding and comparing levels of consciousness in various entities, from simple brain regions to complex systems like humans.

4. **Michael Tye (1995) - Ten Problems of Consciousness: A Representational Theory of the Phenomenal Mind**
   In this book, Tye proposes a representational theory of consciousness. He argues that mental states are essentially representational—they depict or stand for aspects of the world. Consciousness, according to Tye, is a form of representation with phenomenal character (qualia). He tackles ten key problems in understanding consciousness from this perspective, exploring topics like the nature of experience, introspection, and the hard problem of consciousness.

5. **Michael Tye and Briggs Wright (2011) - "Is There a Phenomenology of Thought?"**
   This chapter, also from "Cognitive Phenomenology," questions whether thoughts have phenomenal content—whether they feel like something subjectively. Tye and Wright argue that while thought might seem 'imageless' in introspection, this doesn't imply the absence of phenomenality. They suggest that even without vivid images or inner speech, thoughts could still have a subtle, non-visual phenomenology.

6. **Robert S. Woodworth (1906) - "Imageless Thought"**
   In this classic paper from the Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods, Woodworth challenges the notion that thinking always involves mental images or inner speech. He presents anecdotal evidence and introspective reports suggesting that many thoughts occur without such visual or verbal components, supporting what's now called 'imageless thought.'

7. **Max Velmans and Susan Schneider (2007) - The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness**
   This comprehensive volume provides an overview of consciousness studies, covering topics from philosophical theories to neuroscience perspectives. Edited by Velmans and Schneider, it includes contributions from numerous scholars, offering a broad, multidisciplinary exploration of consciousness's nature, phenomenology, and underlying mechanisms.

8. **Edward N. Zalta (2014) - "Consciousness" in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy**
   This entry offers an extensive overview of contemporary philosophical debates surrounding consciousness, covering topics like the nature and definition of consciousness, its relation to the mind-body problem, the hard problem of consciousness, and various theoretical approaches (such as physicalism, dualism, and representationalism). It's a valuable resource for understanding the current state of philosophical discussions on this topic.


### 19-Queering digital media spatiality_ a phenomenology of bodies being stopped

Title: Queering digital media spatiality: a phenomenology of bodies being stopped
Author: Matilda Tudor
Journal: Feminist Media Studies, Volume 23, Issue 3, 2023

This article by Matilda Tudor explores the politics of location in our digitally interconnected world and argues for a more nuanced understanding of digital media spatiality. The author critiques dominant tropes within current media studies paradigms, such as the online/offline collapse, flow, and the disappearance of media. She proposes that further examination of these concepts is needed to grasp how diverse bodies navigate digital mediaspace.

Tudor's argument is rooted in a case study on queer digital media use in Russia, focusing on same-sex desiring men who maintain a strict separation between their "ordinary" and "queer" lives due to societal pressures. This duality leads the informants to employ various strategies to keep their online and offline worlds separate:

1. Digital compartmentalization: Informants use multiple profiles on social networks, one for their "normal" life and another for their queer activities. They consciously manage these profiles to prevent connections between them through algorithmic bleeding.

2. Selective sharing and control: Informants employ practices such as using different browsers or devices for separate profiles, untagging themselves from photos, editing content, and selectively sharing information to maintain privacy and minimize risks associated with their queer dispositions.

3. Gradual and cautious online/offline transitions: To avoid potential exposure and danger, informants slow down the transition from online interactions to offline meetings. This might involve weeks of online communication before meeting in person, using video calls for initial face-to-face encounters, and meeting in public places with supportive friends.

Tudor aligns her discussion with queer phenomenology by introducing the concept of "moments of shifting," as proposed by Sara Ahmed (2006). These moments highlight disruptions or ruptures experienced when navigating through different spaces, particularly relevant for marginalized individuals.

In summary, this article challenges the notion of seamlessness in digital mediaspace and argues that the lived experiences of diverse bodies are characterized by ongoing negotiations and navigations across various landscapes. It advocates for a media phenomenology that acknowledges power relations and unequal access to space, which has often been overlooked due to essentialist assumptions about embodied practices in relation to media use.


The text presented is a scholarly article by Matilda Tudor that explores the concept of queer digital media phenomenology, focusing on how spatialities intersect with digital practices among sexual minorities, particularly in Russia. Tudor combines theories from Shaun Moores and Sara Ahmed to challenge traditional understandings of flow and primacy of practice in media use.

Moores' work is highlighted for its focus on how place-constituting movements become pre-conscious, habitual 'body schemes,' essentially becoming invisible as they become familiar. This aligns with the broader media studies paradigm that views media as ubiquitous and often unnoticed due to its integration into everyday life (Moores 2012). Tudor emphasizes that while this model applies broadly to various media habits, it should not be assumed that habituation directly correlates with the primacy of a particular practice.

Ahmed's perspective is introduced to counter this assumption by discussing how queer bodies navigate mainstream geographies, internalizing orientations and expectations through their bodily travels (2006). Ahmed terms this "queer failure," as these bodies cannot escape the weight of 'standing out,' unlike heteronormative ones that can blend into the background. 

Tudor applies Ahmed's concept to digital media use, arguing that queer individuals often stand out in their digital practices due to the necessity for calculated management of situational geography and potential discrimination. Using Grindr as an illustration, she highlights how even seemingly invisible apps can be a point of contention, requiring careful usage to avoid negative consequences.

The article also introduces the concept of 'existential media studies,' pioneered by Amanda Lagerkvist, which places the vulnerable human being at the core of media research. It emphasizes the uncertainty and vulnerability of digital existence, challenging assumptions of savviness and skill in favor of a focus on thrownness - our condition as existers navigating digital spaces in search of meaning and security.

Tudor's work underscores the importance of considering power dynamics and contextual factors when analyzing media use, particularly for marginalized groups. It encourages a queer digital media phenomenology that acknowledges disruptions, ruptures, and shifts in digital space rather than assuming seamless flow or primacy of practice. This perspective can contribute to broader discussions on existential media studies by shedding light on the nuanced experiences of lived existence within digital realms.

### 19-The Multidimensionality and Context Dependency of Selves

Title: The Multidimensionality and Context Dependency of Selves

Authors: Leon de Bruin (Free University Amsterdam), Roy Dings (Radboud University Nijmegen), and Shaun Gallagher (University of Memphis)

Published in AJOB Neuroscience, 2017

Summary and Explanation:

The authors discuss the limitations of a minimal Strawsonian concept of self, as applied by Gilbert et al. (2017), to explain phenomenological changes following Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) treatment for psychiatric disorders, specifically Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The Strawsonian perspective focuses on the subject of one's phenomenological experiences, which de Bruin et al. argue fails to capture the multidimensionality and context dependency of self-experience.

1. Multidimensional Self:
The authors propose that a more comprehensive understanding of self can be achieved through Pattern Theory of Self (PTS). This theory posits that a self is not merely a subject of experiences, but a pattern of dynamically related characteristic features or aspects, which may include minimal experiential and embodied aspects, affective, intersubjective, cognitive, narrative, and extended/situated aspects. These aspects are intricately connected and context-dependent.

2. Context Dependency:
PTS acknowledges that the configuration of a self-pattern varies depending on situational factors and contexts (social, work, or private). As such, different aspects of self may become more prominent based on the environment. For instance, intersubjective and affective elements might be accentuated in demanding social environments, while cognitive/psychological factors may play a significant role in work or academic contexts.

3. Implications for DBS-induced changes:
Applying PTS to Gilbert et al.'s (2017) findings allows for a more nuanced interpretation of self-estrangement following DBS treatment. The authors argue that self-estrangement cannot be understood in isolation, as it is closely connected with one's sense of agency and various aspects such as embodiment, motor control processes, reflective evaluation, task-related elements, situatedness, intersubjectivity, social context, narrative, and environmental factors.

4. Contextualizing patient reports:
The authors point out that many patient reports refer to behavioral, embodied, emotional, social, and narrative aspects of self not captured by the minimal Strawsonian perspective. These additional dimensions are essential for understanding the full range of DBS-induced changes. Moreover, several patients' reports highlight the context dependency of their self-experiences—the impact of DBS on their activities, social interactions, and daily life.

5. Critique of Gilbert et al.'s interpretation:
De Bruin et al. argue that Gilbert et al.'s (2017) interpretations of self-estrangement as a loss of control and distorted perception of capacities lack contextualization and acknowledge the multidimensionality of self-experience. They suggest that PTS offers a more suitable framework for capturing these complex phenomena, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between various aspects of self and environmental factors.

In conclusion, de Bruin et al. (2017) propose Pattern Theory of Self as an alternative to the minimal Strawsonian concept of self to better understand phenomenological changes following DBS treatment for psychiatric disorders. They highlight the multidimensionality and context dependency of selves, arguing that a comprehensive understanding requires acknowledging the intricate connections between various aspects of self and environmental factors.


### 19-The Remarkable Logic of Autism_ Developing and Describing an Embedded Curriculum Based in Semi

The article "The Remarkable Logic of Autism: Developing and Describing an Embedded Curriculum Based in Semiotic Phenomenology" by Maureen Connolly presents a unique approach to understanding and addressing the needs of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The author proposes a movement-education-based embedded curriculum that is grounded in semiotic phenomenology, an interdisciplinary framework combining phenomenology and semiotics.

**Semiotic Phenomenology:**

This theoretical lens emphasizes the lived experiences of individuals with ASD by considering their bodies as sites of cultural expression and meaning-making. It acknowledges that people with ASD have unique sensory experiences, interpretations, and ways of navigating the world. The framework also recognizes that these experiences are shaped by societal norms, expectations, and contexts, which can lead to stress and challenges in everyday life.

**Movement Education:**

Central to Connolly's approach is movement education, an educational methodology focusing on the body's themes of self (body), space, quality (effort), and relationship. This thematic approach enables inclusive programming, tailored to individual learners' abilities and interests, fostering adaptability and resourcefulness. Movement education has therapeutic benefits as well, aiding in muscle relaxation and re-patterning for managing stress related to ASD symptoms.

**Challenges of ASD:**

ASD is characterized by impairments in social interaction, language development, and repetitive behaviors or interests. These manifestations vary widely across individuals, leading to heterogeneity in the disorder's presentation. Chronic management strategies are often employed, focusing on behavioral training programs, environmental adaptations, and support for families and caregivers.

**Current Management Approaches:**

Behavioral interventions, including Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), are widely used due to ASD's overt symptoms. These approaches aim to shape desired behaviors through positive reinforcement while reducing undesired ones using consistent routines, schedules, and environmental modifications. Physical activity and exercise programs have also emerged as complementary strategies for improving quality of life and addressing challenging behaviors.

**The Embedded Curriculum:**

Connolly's embedded curriculum integrates semiotic phenomenology with movement education to create a customized, holistic approach for individuals with ASD. By observing and understanding each person's unique sensory experiences and embodied expressions, the curriculum can be tailored to their specific needs and preferences. The program emphasizes:

1. **Movement Profiling:** Systematic observation of participants' motor patterns and habits to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for development.
2. **Sensory Awareness and Integration:** Addressing sensory processing challenges by exploring tactile input, body awareness, and stress management techniques.
3. **Contextualized Learning:** Adapting activities based on individual preferences and skill levels to facilitate engagement and meaningful learning experiences.
4. **Relational Development:** Fostering social connections through collaborative movement exercises, promoting reciprocal interactions and communication skills.
5. **Environmental Accommodations:** Modifying physical spaces to reduce sensory overload and enhance comfort for participants.

**Conclusion:**

Connolly's work highlights the potential of semiotic phenomenology in understanding ASD's complexities and designing effective, individualized interventions. By embracing a bodily-centered approach that respects each person's unique experiences, this embedded curriculum offers a promising alternative to traditional behavioral models for improving quality of life and functional outcomes for individuals with autism spectrum disorder.


The text discusses an embedded curriculum developed by Maureen Connolly for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This curriculum, based on her observations over ten years across various contexts, aims to address the unique challenges faced by people with ASD through a phenomenological and semiotic lens.

Key components of this embedded curriculum include:

1. **Environment**: The environment is designed to minimize excess stimulation while promoting body involvement. It features absorptive surfaces for sustained foot contact, unstable surfaces for balance challenges, dim lighting, and contrasting heights and textures between activities to facilitate distinct transitions. Objects used are heavy and non-bouncy, requiring more gross motor activity, and there are multiple entry/exit points and equipment options for problem-solving and play.

2. **Content and Process**: The program includes structured activities with visual schedules, social stories, scripting, and re-directing to manage potential frustration or anxiety. Activities focus on body awareness, core-distal relationships, spinal flexibility, pushing/pulling, lifting, carrying, midline crossing, intense gross motor activity, landings, weight transfers, and balance regain.

3. **Instructional Strategies**: Given the tendency of individuals with ASD to not initiate or conclude activities independently, instruction is ongoing, vigilant, and calm. Direct instruction or low teacher-student ratios are employed for concept learning across physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development dimensions.

The curriculum's goals are to identify individual strengths and weaknesses, refine strengths, address weaknesses, enable meaningful interaction with peer groups, and continue developing programs based on individuals' profiles. The gymnasium space is strategically arranged to cater to the tendencies within ASD, such as noise sensitivity, vertical/horizontal tracking selectivity, and vestibular, tactile, and kinaesthetic needs.

Observed outcomes include improved sleep patterns, expanded movement repertoires, better motor milestones, reduced 'stimming' behaviors, enhanced redirection skills, and increased social awareness. The curriculum positively impacts not only participants but also their families and professionals involved in their care by promoting stress management, reflective practice, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

This embedded curriculum embodies a socially conscious research approach, generating theory from the lived experiences of individuals with ASD. It challenges traditional epistemological assumptions about the body and consciousness, advocating for a bodily-based, culturally sensitive human science approach to understanding and supporting people with ASD.

### 20-Inference by Analogy and the Progress of Knowledge_ From Reflection to Determination in Judgem

Preston Stovall's article "Inference by Analogy and the Progress of Knowledge: From Reflection to Determination in Judgments of Natural Purpose" explores how Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" can be interpreted as an example of Kant's "reflecting power of judgment," which Hegel associates with inference by analogy, and Peirce relates to abduction or hypothesis. Stovall argues that Darwin's theory of natural selection provided a new way of understanding the purposive character of organic generation and growth without relying on an analogy with intentional agency.

To support this argument, Stovall first examines Kant's concept of teleological judgments in his Critique of the Power of Judgment. According to Kant, while we are obligated to use mechanistic explanation for objects in space and time, complex organic phenomena force us to adopt a purposive frame by analogy with agency. Purposive explanation is incompatible with mechanistic explanation for Kant; it merely serves as a heuristic device to understand the coordination of organic activities towards self-maintenance and species propagation.

Next, Stovall discusses Hegel's interpretation of syllogistic inference in his Science of Logic, demonstrating that Hegel associates third figure (hypothetical) inference with inference by analogy. In this context, inferences enlarge a kind term's sphere of extension and potentially explain properties an individual exhibits. In contrast, analogical inference uses the commonality between two kinds to hypothesize new properties for one or both kinds.

Stovall then connects Kant, Hegel, and Peirce by showing how Darwin's theory represents a shift in our understanding of natural purpose. While Kant's teleology is source-to-target (intentional agency as the source guiding target organic processes), Darwin's work allows us to reconceive the categorial frame within which we understand natural purposes, turning organic activity into a model for explaining other domains.

In essence, Stovall posits that Darwin's hypothesis can be understood as an abductive inference arising from an exercise of the reflecting power of judgment, as reconstructed through Kant, Hegel, and Peirce. By demonstrating how this reconceptualization of organic purpose impacted subsequent reasoning about mind and society in American intellectual circles during the second half of the 19th century, Stovall suggests that Darwin's work dissolved certain problems related to mechanistic and purposive explanations.

This interpretation highlights how scientific progress involves refining our understanding of nature by revising conceptual frameworks, moving from reflective judgment (Kant) to determinative reasoning through abductive inference (Peirce), with Darwin's work illustrating this transition in action. By reinterpreting organic purpose without relying on intentional agency analogy, Darwin provided a new foundation for understanding biological phenomena and, consequently, expanded the possibilities for applying such reasoning to other domains.


This passage discusses the evolution of scientific understanding regarding the purposive nature of organic things, focusing on Immanuel Kant's perspective and how it was challenged and reoriented by Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection.

Kant believed that purpose in organisms could be understood through an analogy with human-made artifacts or artefacts. He saw the purposive explanation of nature modeled on purpose within the human domain, specifically in the creation of artefacts by an artiﬁcer who has a design in mind. This design guides how the work unfolds, representing the whole as an end that causally influences the operations leading to that end.

Similarly, Kant viewed organic things as if they were designed with an internal regulation that appropriates external forces for survival and wards off those threatening destruction. However, he maintained that non-intentional purposes in nature are insufficient, as attempts to explain them using idealist ideas do not solve the question of their first ground but rather nullify it by reducing purpose to a mere ontological concept with no real existence.

The text then moves on to describe how researchers like Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and Carl von Linnaeus contributed to biological classification in the 18th century, focusing on their methods of grouping plants based on similarities or "habits" (Tournefort) and reproductive organs (Linnaeus). Both emphasized the importance of understanding an organism's genealogy for its identity.

The passage also highlights how Linnaeus' work influenced future researchers, despite difficulties in classifying plants according to a unified system, especially when it came to higher taxonomic levels (genus and above). This laid the groundwork for debates about species fixism during the 19th century.

The text then discusses comparative morphology as a guide to species classification in the early 19th century, with figures like Étienne Geoffroy St.-Hilaire and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe making significant contributions. The debate centered on distinguishing morphological features revealing common classifications from those indicating only superficial similarities.

Richard Owen's work on vertebrates, using comparative morphology to classify organisms based on structural homologies (similar structures performing different functions) and analogues (structures with the same function but different structure), is also mentioned. By the 1850s, functional definitions were considered suspicious, while structural aspects became observationally unproblematic.

The passage concludes by discussing Darwin's hypothesis as an extended operation of reflective judgment culminating in abductive inference (inference to the best explanation). It argues that Darwin's theory can be understood as reorganizing our understanding of organic purpose, shifting from a prospective view (looking forward towards given outcomes) to a retrospective perspective (focusing on ancestry and survival traits' role in species preservation). This reorganization challenges Kant's prospective intentional understanding of natural purposes.

The text concludes by suggesting that Darwin's hypothesis, which allows for a non-intentional explanation of organic purpose based on retrospective genealogical understanding, offers an alternative to Kant's conception and has significantly impacted the way we understand mind's place in nature. American pragmatists, such as John Dewey, Chauncey Wright, Edward Drinker Cope, John Fiske, Lester F. Ward, and James Mark Baldwin, adopted Darwinian principles to explain various domains, including mind, society, and culture, showcasing the progressive character of Darwin's conception of organic teleology compared to Kant's views.


The paper by Preston Stovall explores the evolution of conceptual understanding in biology, specifically focusing on the shift from a reﬂective to a determining employment of judgements concerning organic purpose. The author argues that Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" exemplifies this conceptual revolution and serves as an instance of a particular form of reasoning discussed in previous sections.

Stovall begins by discussing abduction, inference by analogy, and Kant's reflection on the limits of human cognition. He posits that Darwin's work represents a case where our rational faculties were compelled into reﬂection due to insufficient concepts for understanding organic phenomena. Through this process of reﬂection, new concepts and modes of explanation emerged.

The author then delves into Kant's philosophy, critiquing his view that the distinction between mind and mechanistic nature lies in mental activity being governed by representations of laws (rules). According to Kant, purposive explanations are merely reflective judgements, not determinative ones, because they do not claim to describe how things actually are but rather represent how organisms seem to behave given their cognitive limitations.

Stovall argues that Darwin's hypothesis—natural selection—allowed for a rethinking of purposive language in the organic world. This new understanding posits that teleological explanations are not attributions of intentionality to objects but rather modes of reasoning that structure our subjunctive suppositions and interpretations of objects within a web of possibility.

In essence, Stovall's argument contends that Darwin's work demonstrates how our capacity for making judgements about organic purpose evolved from a reﬂective to a determining mode. This evolution was facilitated by the development of explanatory resources allowing us to understand organic purposes without relying on an analogy with intentional agency.

The paper concludes by addressing the long-standing apparent incompatibility between mechanistic and purposive explanation, suggesting that this dichotomy can be resolved within a Darwinian framework when teleological explanations are understood as modes of reasoning rather than attributions of intentionality to objects. This perspective allows for the consistent application of mechanical causation alongside teleological interpretations in understanding the organic world.

In summary, Stovall's paper offers an analysis of conceptual shifts in biology and philosophy by examining the evolution of our understanding of organic purpose. By exploring the limitations of Kantian thought and the groundbreaking work of Darwin, he demonstrates how a reevaluation of judgement and analogical reasoning can lead to profound changes in scientific understanding.


### 20-Mimetic Phantasia in Action_ Marc Richir_s Phenomenology of Intersubjectivity

Mauro Senatore's article, "Mimetic Phantasia in Action: Marc Richir's Phenomenology of Intersubjectivity," published in the Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology (55:2, 149-166), explores the genetic analyses of intersubjective apperception developed by French phenomenologist Marc Richir. Senatore's reading hypothesis is that these analyses constitute an original contribution to the standard Husserlian account of empathy within Richir's broader project of revising/refounding genetic phenomenology.

Richir's approach centers on the poorly explored phenomenological field of phantasia and its temporalization in presence, which he posits as more archaic than symbolical institutions such as the real I (Ich) and living body (Leibkörper). Senatore traces Richir's reinterpretation of two texts from Husserl's phenomenology of intersubjectivity (Hua XIII, n.10 and n.13), demonstrating that Richir finds in these texts the phenomenological attestation of nomadic and presubjective phantasia that Husserl had discovered earlier in his 1904-05 lectures on phantasy.

The article is divided into two main sections: (1) "The Phenomenological Attestation of Phantasia" and (2) "Non-standard Genetic Analyses." In Section I, Senatore summarizes Husserl's arguments regarding the implication of the actual I and living body in phantasy, and how this relates to the representation of other lived experiences. Richir argues that Husserl's analysis reveals a more archaic vitality of consciousness—phantasia—that challenges the standard phenomenological epoché by suspending all symbolical institutions and relocating perceptual apperception within its corresponding architectonic site.

In Section II, Senatore presents Richir's non-standard genetic account of intersubjective apperception based on his reinterpretation of Husserl's texts. Richir interprets Husserl's description of the apprehension of a stranger body as another's living body (Leib) to sketch out an original phenomenological analysis of the mimetic play of phantasia at work in apperception. This mimesis, according to Richir, is non-specular and active, involving the implication of the Phantasieleib (the living body prior to its symbolical institution) in the representation of other lived experiences without directly engaging the empirical I or Leibkörper.

Richir's reinterpretation of Husserl's texts aims to demonstrate that phantasia is more archaic than the Stiftung (symbolical institution) of the real I and living body, and that it enables the apperception of other lived experiences by constituting a nomadic circulation that transcends the actual subject. This analysis ultimately repositions the standard phenomenological ideas of togetherness and expressivity within an archaic play of phantasia, revealing their implications for intersubjective understanding.


The text discusses Marc Richir's interpretation of Edmund Husserl's phenomenology of intersubjectivity, focusing on Richir's book "Phénoménologie en esquisses - Nouvelles fondations" (2000). Richir offers a non-standard approach to understanding how we apprehend the other as a subject with lived experiences.

1. **Richir's Phenomenological Framework**: Richir's phenomenology is rooted in Husserl's work but expands on it, particularly focusing on the role of imagination (phantasia) in consciousness. He emphasizes that our understanding of others is not intuitive but rather a result of imaginative processes.

2. **Apperception of the Other**: Richir argues that our apprehension of another person's body and experiences is facilitated by the "Stiftung" (foundation) of our own Leibkörper, which includes our physical body and its symbolic institution within our consciousness. This Stiftung allows us to recognize aspects of others as part of their living bodies rather than external objects.

3. **Mimetic Phantasia**: Richir highlights the role of mimetic phantasia in this process. Mimetic phantasia is not a simple imitation or representation but an active, living process that operates nomadically and presubjectively. It's through this phantasia that we can "presentify" (make present) aspects of others' experiences that are not immediately intuitive to us.

4. **Architectonic Transpositions**: Richir introduces the concept of architectonic transpositions, which refers to how our consciousness is organized into a spatial and temporal structure. These transpositions help explain how we can apprehend others as subjects with lived experiences within our own consciousness.

5. **Symbolical Institutions**: Richir also discusses the role of symbolical institutions, which are the ways our consciousness categorizes and structures experiences. The Leibkörper, for instance, is a symbolical institution that allows us to perceive ourselves as subjects with a body and experiences.

6. **Intersubjectivity**: Richir's interpretation of intersubjectivity moves away from traditional notions of empathy or shared experiences. Instead, he suggests that our understanding of others is mediated by our own imaginative processes and the symbolical institutions within our consciousness. This perspective challenges the idea that intersubjectivity is a direct, intuitive perception of others' experiences.

7. **Phenomenological Blinking**: Richir introduces the concept of "phenomenological blinking" to describe how elements of our consciousness fleetingly appear or disappear in awareness. This concept helps explain how we can apprehend aspects of others that are not immediately present within our own consciousness.

In summary, Richir's interpretation of Husserl's phenomenology emphasizes the role of imagination and symbolical institutions in understanding others as subjects with lived experiences. It moves away from traditional notions of intersubjectivity as direct perception or empathy, instead proposing a complex process mediated by our own consciousness' organization and active imaginative processes.


### 20-The meaning and feasibility of engaging in physical activity while being employed in people wi

Title: The Meaning and Feasibility of Engaging in Physical Activity while Employed for People with Mild to Moderate Disability due to Multiple Sclerosis: A Qualitative Study

The study published in the European Journal of Physiotherapy explores the perceptions of employed individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) regarding the meaning and feasibility of engaging in physical activity (PA) during their work hours. The research aimed to understand how these participants view PA's role in their professional lives and the challenges they encounter when trying to incorporate PA into their daily routines.

**Methods:**

- **Design:** A qualitative study using individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews.
- **Context:** The research was part of a larger pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing CoreDISTparticipation (a new complex intervention linking healthcare levels and sectors to optimize sensorimotor function, PA, and employment) with usual care for MS patients.
- **Sample:** 26 participants diagnosed with MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] ≤ 3.5), aged 18 or older, employed, and registered at the MS-OP clinic at Nordland Hospital Trust. Interviews were conducted with both intervention group members (n=15) and control group participants (n=11).
- **Data Collection:** Interviews were guided by open-ended questions focusing on experiences with employment, work-related follow-up, exercise, physical activity, perceived health, the work situation, and thoughts about future employment. The interviews lasted between 51 and 97 minutes, resulting in a total of 30 hours and 39 minutes of audio recordings and 556 pages of transcription.
- **Analysis:** Systematic text condensation was used to analyze the data within a phenomenological hermeneutic framework informed by pattern theory of self (PTS). Four analytical steps were employed: total impression, identification and sorting of meaning units, condensation, and synthesis.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Meaningfulness of PA for Work:** Participants recognized that PA can enhance their alertness, strength, and overall satisfaction at work, contributing to better performance and self-perception.
2. **Balancing Daily Life, PA, and Work when Energy is Low:** The study found that managing fatigue, cognitive challenges, and prioritizing tasks are crucial for incorporating PA into daily life while working.
3. **Leisure PA during Work Hours is Beneficial but Challenging to Implement:** Participants saw the potential advantages of engaging in leisure-based physical activities (PA) during work hours, such as improved focus and reduced fatigue; however, they also highlighted various obstacles like limited time, colleague expectations, and lack of support from management or line managers.

**Implications:**

This study contributes to the understanding that employed individuals with mild to moderate MS perceive PA as meaningful for their health, function, and work, influencing self-perception and perceived capabilities at work. The feasibility of PA is influenced by individual, environmental, and/or social factors. Therefore, tailoring work adjustments—like accommodating leisure PA during working hours—can facilitate both PA and employment for MS patients with low disability levels.

**Pattern Theory of Self (PTS):** The research incorporated PTS to better understand the participants' self-related aspects and meaning in relation to their experiences with MS, PA, and work. Ten distinguishing features of the self-pattern were analyzed, including bodily processes, prereflective experiential processes, affective processes, behavioral/action processes, social/intersubjective processes, and others—to reveal the complex interplay between these factors in shaping the participants' experiences.


This text presents a research study on the role of physical activity (PA) in the lives of individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) who are employed. The study is grounded in a phenomenological theory, Phenomenology of the Taken-for-Granted Self (PTS), which emphasizes cognitive, ecological, normative, and reflective processes in shaping personal identity.

The research findings highlight several key aspects:

1. **Meaningfulness of physical activity for work**: PA was perceived as crucial for maintaining or improving work capacity, performance, satisfaction, and retention. It impacted participants' self-esteem, quality of life, and sense of identity as employees. Improved physical and mental capabilities through PA led to better contact with the floor, balance, less dizziness, and increased energy levels during work hours.

2. **Balancing daily life, physical activity, and work when energy is low**: Balancing work, PA, and daily life was challenging due to limited energy and time. Participants had to prioritize these aspects wisely, often leading them to adjust their work schedules or reduce working hours to accommodate PA.

3. **Leisure physical activity during work hours is beneficial but challenging to implement**: Most participants believed that arranging for leisure-time PA during work hours could benefit employment, especially when energy or leisure time was limited. However, implementing such an arrangement was difficult due to social and normative practices, organizational structures, and a reluctance to discuss one's illness or limitations at work.

The study underscores the importance of PA in shaping self-perception, identity, and employment among pwMS. It also highlights the complex interplay between individual, environmental, and social factors that influence the feasibility of engaging in PA while employed. The findings suggest that improving action processes (behaviors, actions, habits, and skills) through PA can strengthen one's sense of agency, self-identity, and possibilities for handling work situations, thereby facilitating employment.

The study's strengths include its holistic phenomenological approach, which integrates cognitive, ecological, normative, and reflective processes in understanding personal identity, and the use of first-person experiences from pwMS. Limitations might include potential biases due to authors' backgrounds and preconceptions, although they attempted to be aware of these and sought external perspectives for validation.

In conclusion, this research provides valuable insights into how PA can be a powerful tool in shaping self-perception and identity among employed individuals with MS, influencing their perceived capabilities and opportunities for work. It underscores the need for individualized, reasonable work adjustments to facilitate PA, potentially benefiting both employees' health and productivity.


Title: "Physical Activity, Employment, and Self-Management Strategies in Multiple Sclerosis: A Qualitative Study"

This study explores the experiences of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) regarding physical activity (PA), employment, and self-management strategies. The research aimed to provide insights into how emphasizing PA, fostering dialog about it in the workplace, and considering work-life balance could facilitate PA and employment for people living with MS.

Methodology:
The study applied a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis based on a pattern theory of self. The researchers conducted 20 interviews with individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, focusing on their experiences related to PA, employment, and self-management strategies.

Key Findings:
1. Physical activity was perceived as vital for managing MS symptoms, improving overall health, and maintaining independence.
2. Participants highlighted the importance of tailoring exercise programs to individual needs, preferences, and abilities, considering factors such as fatigue management, mobility issues, and cognitive challenges.
3. Workplace support was crucial for engaging in PA, including flexible work arrangements, understanding from colleagues, and accommodations (e.g., ergonomic equipment or modified duties).
4. Participants discussed the complex relationship between MS symptoms, fatigue, and employment, noting that managing these factors together was essential for maintaining sustainable work engagement.
5. Self-management strategies involved self-awareness of one's capabilities and limitations, goal setting, and continuous monitoring and adjustment of activities to optimize outcomes.
6. The study found that early implementation of PA and employment support could help individuals better adapt to MS symptoms over time.

Implications:
1. Emphasizing the benefits of tailored physical activity programs in managing MS symptoms can encourage engagement and potentially lead to improved quality of life.
2. Workplaces should promote open dialog about PA, provide supportive environments (e.g., flexible work arrangements), and offer reasonable accommodations for individuals with MS.
3. Health professionals such as physiotherapists could play a significant role in facilitating communication between patients and employers regarding PA and providing individualized solutions to enhance the feasibility of engaging in physical activities at an early stage.
4. Further research is needed on work-related outcomes from physical activity for individuals with MS and the involvement of health professionals in facilitating sustained PA combined with employment.

This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how emphasizing PA, fostering workplace dialog about PA, and considering work-life balance can help manage MS symptoms, maintain employability, and improve overall well-being for those living with the condition.


### 20-Why _getting_ the phenomenology of recognition _right_ matters for epistemology

Title: Why (Getting) the Phenomenology of Recognition Right Matters for Epistemology

Author: Hagit Benbaji

Journal: Philosophical Explorations

Year: 2022

Summary:

Hagit Benbaji explores the relationship between phenomenology and epistemology in the context of recognizing kind properties (e.g., being a eucalyptus tree) within visual experience. The paper addresses two conflicting intuitions regarding how kind properties are presented in our visual experiences:

1. Difference Intuition: Acquiring the capacity to recognize an object as belonging to a specific kind (eucalyptus, for example) changes one's visual experience of that object.
2. Sameness Intuition: Despite acquiring recognitional capacities, the way objects are visually presented remains unchanged; the difference is in how we see or interpret these objects based on our knowledge.

Benbaji argues that uniform theories of visual experience (content view and object view) fail to account for both intuitions adequately:

- Content View: Kinds cannot be part of the content of visual experience without violating the Sameness Intuition, as acquiring new concepts would alter the content.
- Object View: The notion of 'two looks' (thin and thick) does not accurately represent how visual experiences change with recognitional capacities, as it conflates sensory and conceptual aspects of experience.

To reconcile these conflicting intuitions, Benbaji proposes a hybrid view that combines elements from both the content and object views:

1. K-properties are not part of how visual experience represents objects but are recognized through an extra-sensory act of recognition (object view aspect).
2. Concepts of colors and shapes are part of the content of visual experience, which can be altered by recognitional capacities (content view aspect).
3. The application of K-concepts affects the phenomenology of visual experience itself—the way we see or interpret objects based on their kind properties (addressing both intuitions).

This hybrid account maintains that visual experiences are conceptual and that recognitional capacities change the phenomenological appearance of objects, without introducing a separate 'look' or layer of content. Benbaji argues that this view is epistemically significant because it provides a coherent framework for understanding how perceptual knowledge develops through the acquisition of recognitional capacities.

The paper ultimately emphasizes that phenomenology and epistemology are interconnected, as our intuitions about visual experiences carry important implications for our understanding of perceptual knowledge. By getting the phenomenology of recognition right, we can better comprehend how we acquire knowledge through perception.


The text discusses a philosophical debate about the nature of visual experience and perceptual knowledge, specifically concerning "K-properties" – properties of kinds like 'eucalyptus' or 'male chick'. Two key intuitions are considered: the difference intuition and the sameness intuition.

1. The Difference Intuition: This intuition asserts that there is a phenomenological difference between how visual experiences present different kinds of properties. For instance, when a botanist sees a tree and recognizes it as an eucalyptus, the experience itself changes—the tree now looks like an eucalyptus. In contrast, a chicken-sexer can reliably identify the gender of a chick without having any distinct visual experience related to gender. The chicken-sexer's knowledge is inferential, not immediate; she doesn't have a specific way the chick 'looks' male.

2. The Sameness Intuition: This intuition posits that when we see an object with K-properties (like an eucalyptus), our visual experience represents these properties directly, just like it does for sensory properties (color, shape). If this were not the case, then recognizing a kind would simply be a reliable inclination to judge, without any distinctive phenomenology.

The text argues that both intuitions are crucial for understanding perceptual knowledge:

- The Difference Intuition supports the idea that recognitional capacities for K-properties affect our experience, making it a reason for our beliefs about those properties. Without this difference, justification by experience would be too hard—there'd be no appropriate relation between the experience and the corresponding judgment, and the experience would lose its rational force.

- The Sameness Intuition suggests that K-properties are represented in visual experience just like sensory properties. If we can't account for this sameness, justification by experience becomes too easy—we'd merely say 'it looks that way', without any epistemic distinction from saying 'it looks green'.

The text also introduces a hybrid view to resolve the dilemma presented by these intuitions. This view posits two kinds of reasons:

1. Content Model: Experience justifies beliefs by sharing its content. When we see an object, our visual experience places it in our field of vision with certain colors and shapes. However, recognizing a kind isn't merely about the object's sensory properties; it involves applying a concept to that object, changing how we see it.

2. Object-Awareness Model: This model draws from the 'object view' in philosophy of mind. It argues that acquaintance with an object (grasping its concept) makes applying that concept to the object evidently correct. In the case of K-properties, recognizing an eucalyptus changes our phenomenological experience—we now see it as a eucalyptus. This change in how we perceive the object is a reason for judging it as such.

The hybrid view claims that recognition isn't seeing or believing; instead, it's an "in-between mode of awareness" (seeing-as), where we become aware of how what we see is a reason for our judgment about the object's kind. This awareness is passive—it doesn't involve active application of concepts but rather makes concept-application evidently correct due to our acquaintance with the object.


### 21-Habit_ sedimentation and institutions

Title: Habit, Sedimentation, and Institutions by Shaun Gallagher

In this article, philosopher Shaun Gallagher explores the concept of habit from an enactivist perspective, emphasizing its contextualized intelligence rather than rigid repetition. He argues that recent enactivist discussions align with pragmatist views, offering a nuanced understanding of habits in everyday actions and skilled performances.

1. Introduction: Gallagher distinguishes between intellectualist and behaviorist conceptions of habit, which view it as blindly repetitive, rigid behaviors. Instead, he focuses on the enactivist anti-intellectualist perspective, which considers habits as intelligent, context-sensitive modes of response. He also introduces phenomenology's concept of sedimentation to understand how habits relate to social, cultural, and institutional factors, building upon Pierre Bourdieu's habitus theory despite their differences.

2. Intellectualism, pragmatism, and enactive accounts of habit: Gallagher reviews enactivist theorists (e.g., Cappuccio et al., 2021; Di Paolo et al., 2017; Hutto & Robertson, 2020; Ilundáin-Agurruza et al., 2020) who argue that habits are flexible and adaptive processes, unlike intellectualist (e.g., Stanley, 2011) and behaviorist views that deem habits as mechanical routines. Enactivists view habits as intelligent dispositions, heedful of the environment, and responsive to changes in circumstances. This perspective draws on pragmatist John Dewey's concept of habit as a predisposition towards ways of responding, which is open and adaptive rather than rigidly automatic.

3. The phenomenology of habit: Gallagher introduces the phenomenological concept of sedimentation, which describes how experiences become embedded in our unconscious past while retaining operative influence on perception and ongoing experience. Husserl's analysis of intrinsic temporality reveals that sensory impressions can sediment as memories, potentially reactivated and shaping future perceptions. This process is not entirely rigid; instead, habits allow for flexible adjustments in response to varying environmental conditions, as observed in skilled performances like a baseball batter's swing.

4. Habitus: Bourdieu's misguided critique of Husserl: Gallagher argues that Bourdieu's critique of Husserl's concepts of habit and sedimentation is flawed, as both share similarities in their understanding of the social origins of habits. While Bourdieu views habitus as an anonymous collective system instituting and stabilizing practices within a society, he overlooks Husserl's later generative phenomenology that acknowledges the social, particularly through tradition. Gallagher suggests that both concepts allow for flexibility in habitual performance while also introducing stability through sedimentation.

5. Habit from an institutional perspective: Gallagher illustrates how habits are relational and environmentally dependent by using a morning routine of grabbing a cup to make tea as an example. He highlights that even seemingly automatic habits rely on stable environmental features (e.g., cabinet positioning) for their execution, demonstrating the interdependence between habits, individuals, material goods, ecological factors, social institutions, and normative structures.

6. Conclusion: Gallagher summarizes his argument, emphasizing four key aspects of habit and sedimentation: (1) the tension between structural stability in sedimented meanings/customs and flexible performance; (2) reciprocal effects of habits, shaping both individuals and their environment; (3) relational nature of habits, not confined to individual agents; and (4) the inclusion of social, cultural, and institutional dimensions inhabiting sedimentation processes. He acknowledges that further research is needed to develop a more precise understanding of sedimentation and its role in bridging habitual practices with institutions while addressing the complexities of bricolage and potential pathologies within institutional structures.

The article contributes to the philosophical discussion on habit by integrating enactivist, pragmatist, and phenomenological perspectives. Gallagher's work highlights the importance of contextualized intelligence in understanding habits while also acknowledging their relational nature and dependence on environmental factors, which are crucial for a comprehensive analysis of habit formation and its role in institutions.


The text is a scholarly essay discussing the concept of 'habit' from various philosophical, psychological, and sociological perspectives. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Habit as Mechanical vs. Sensitive Responses**: The essay begins by noting that while some view habits as blindly mechanical reactions, others argue they can involve complex sensitivities to context and intentions (Montero, 2016). This reflects the diverse interpretations of habit in philosophy and psychology literature.

2. **Adaptive Flexibility of Reflexes**: The essay highlights that reflexive reactions may not be as straightforward as they seem due to the adaptive flexibility of long-latency reflexes (Kurtzer, 2014). These reflexes allow for rapid adjustments in muscle movements based on varying loads and limb dynamics.

3. **Husserl's Sedimentation**: The author delves into Edmund Husserl's concept of 'sedimentation', which he uses to describe the build-up of habitual dispositions over time. This process involves a transformation rather than just an addition, where initial rules gradually change into know-how or habit (Husserl, 1972).

4. **Unconscious as Limit-Mode of Consciousness**: Husserl posits that the 'unconscious', often thought of as a nothingness in phenomenology, is actually a limit-mode of consciousness—a concept related to sedimentation (Husserl, 1969).

5. **Bourdieu's Habitus**: The essay compares Husserl's account with Pierre Bourdieu's concept of 'habitus'. While Bourdieu stresses the anonymous and passive nature of habitus, Husserl's view is part of his overall genetic phenomenology, appreciating individual agency in generating habits (Moran, 2011).

6. **Pragmatism and Habit**: The author suggests that resources exist in pragmatism—like Peirce's semiotics or Dewey's emphasis on social existence—that could support a broader institutional conception of habit (Gronow, 2012). However, this perspective is currently underdeveloped in pragmatic social theory.

7. **Sedimentation as Additive and Transformative Process**: The essay notes that sedimentation isn't merely an additive process (like geological sedimentary layers), but also involves transformation—as seen in Andy Clark's work on skill development, where initial rules become embedded or embodied in readiness to act (Clark & Chalmers, 1998).

In essence, the essay argues that habit is a multifaceted concept that transcends simple definitions. It explores how different philosophers and psychologists interpret habits, emphasizing their complexity and dynamic nature—involving both mechanical responses and sensitive adjustments based on context and intentions. The essay also highlights the historical and contemporary debates surrounding habit, drawing connections between phenomenology, pragmatism, and cognitive sciences.


### 21-Kant_s Anti-Scientism and the Origins of Phenomenology

Richard McDonough's article "Kant's Anti-Scientism and the Origins of Phenomenology" explores Kant's views on psychology and their influence on phenomenology, particularly Husserl's work. The author argues against the mechanistic interpretation of Kant, which posits that Kant's philosophy can be seen as a precursor to contemporary cognitive science.

1. **Kant's Anti-Scientism and Psychology:**

   - McDonough asserts that Kant's primary reason for denying psychology as a science is not the inapplicability of mathematics to inner sense, but rather the limitation of substance to bodies in space.
   - Kant's view is that cognitions are not substances and cannot be reidentified over time, which makes experimentation impossible—a crucial requirement for natural sciences.

2. **Kemp Smith's Argument for Mechanistic Interpretation:**

   - McDonough critiques Kemp Smith's claim that Kant reconciles the unitary system of phenomena with the principle of substance by maintaining that categories acquire meaning through outer appearances.
   - He argues that this interpretation misrepresents Kant, as it overlooks Kant's qualification in saying cognitions are "affected" rather than causally interacted with light.

3. **Kant and the Foundations of Phenomenology:**

   - McDonough highlights five reasons Kant gives for why psychology cannot be a science, all stemming from his denial that cognitions can be treated as substances.
   - These reasons include: (i) Psychology not being an experimental doctrine due to the one-dimensionality of time; (ii) Cognitions not being subject to analysis because they are not composed of substantial parts; (iii) The ineliminability of subjectivity, as another thinking subject does not conform to our purposes; (iv) Psychical being not independent from observation, altering the observed state.

4. **Kant's Positive Account of the Empirical Self:**

   - McDonough notes Kant's seemingly contradictory statement that while one cannot quantify items in inner sense, perhaps one can quantify the flow of changes.
   - On this interpretation, Kant allows for a phenomenological account of the 'flow' or sequence of cognitions within inner sense—a concept later developed by Husserl into an account of psychical processes.

5. **Continuity with Phenomenology:**

   - McDonough underscores how Kant's denial that cognitions are composed of substances suggests a form of externalism, where the identity and unity of mental states depend on their temporal relations within a sequence or 'flow.'
   - This view prefigures Husserl’s selsamen (essences) and noema-noesis distinction in phenomenology.

In conclusion, McDonough's article contends that Kant's philosophy is more aligned with the phenomenological tradition than mechanistic cognitive science. His views on the self and psychology highlight a fundamental difference from materialist perspectives—the self is not reducible to substances in space but should be understood as a diachronic, processual entity. This understanding paved the way for phenomenological explorations of consciousness and subjectivity by thinkers like Husserl.


The passage discusses the philosophical views of Immanuel Kant and Edmund Husserl regarding mental states, emphasizing their relational nature and historical embeddedness. 

1. **Relational Nature of Mental States**: Both Kant and Husserl argue that mental states are not isolated entities but are interconnected in a logical system or holistic structure. This means that mental perceptions are embedded in a continuous process, where the same object appears in different orientations over time, forming a logical connection rather than causal ones. 

2. **Historical Embeddedness**: The passage highlights the temporal aspect of this continuity. Perceptions are not disconnected instances but are linked in an inner sense that evolves over time, displaying an internal connectedness. This flow cannot be explained by causality; instead, it's characterized as a species of logical connection or holism. 

3. **Critique of Causal/Mechanical Models**: Kant and Husserl reject the mechanistic model of mind. They argue that mental states should not be viewed as reidentifiable substance subject to conservation principles, but rather as a vital process with an organic structure, akin to biological growth. 

4. **Kant's Influence on Husserl**: The author suggests Kant's philosophy lays the groundwork for what becomes the phenomenological tradition. This includes themes like holism and temporal embeddedness of mental states, denial of scientific status to psychology, and the view that the self is a vital phenomenon rather than a mechanical entity. 

5. **Kant's Rejection of Naturalism**: Kant's opposition to naturalism (as expressed in his Prolegomena) and 'soulless materialism' informs this perspective. This rejection, carried forward by Husserl, forms part of a broader European philosophical tradition critical of scientistic and mechanistic views of mind. 

6. **Significance in the Contemporary Context**: The author argues that understanding Kant correctly is crucial today due to the prevalence of mechanistic cognitive science. They assert this because, despite its popularity, contemporary mechanistic models fail to adequately explain mental phenomena without distortion, echoing Kant's critique of attempting to explain organic beings using merely mechanical principles. 

In essence, the passage discusses how Kant and Husserl challenge traditional mechanistic views of mind, advocating instead for a vitalist, holistic model that rejects reductionism. It underscores the importance of these philosophical perspectives in critiquing current scientific approaches to understanding consciousness and mental processes.


### 21-Perception beyond Inference

Title: Perception beyond Inference - A Book Review by Frank Scalambrino

In "Perception beyond Inference," edited by Liliana Albertazzi, Gert J. van Tonder, and Dhanraj Vishwanath, the authors explore various aspects of perception from a perspective that transcends traditional inference-based approaches. The book is organized around five sections, each focusing on different dimensions of perceptual experience: Time and Dynamics, Color, Shape, and Space, Language and Perception, and Perception in Art, Design, and Computation.

1. Introduction: The editors introduce the reader to a perception-centric theory of vision, emphasizing that perception is not merely a re-presentation of an objective external reality or a direct reflection of the physical environment but instead involves complex, dynamic processes.

2. Time and Dynamics (Chapters 2-5): This section focuses on critiquing naive realism and exploring alternative approaches rooted in Brentano's and Gestalt psychology. Key concepts introduced include:

   a. Dynamic Space: Perception is seen as actively constructing meaning from the environment rather than passively mirroring it, allowing for multiple interpretations of space based on perceptual primitives.
   
   b. Praegnanz: A principle describing the tendency to perceive stimuli as regular, simple, and symmetrical, which helps explain how our minds make sense of ambiguous visual information without relying on explicit inference or external reality as a foundation.

3. Color, Shape, and Space (Chapters 6-9): The authors investigate phenomena related to material appearances, picture interpretation, and perceptual organization, emphasizing the explanatory gap between sensory input and meaningful perception. They propose biologically plausible computational frameworks that integrate perceptual experience, computation, and neural organization.

4. Language and Perception (Chapters 10-11): This section discusses the relationship between language, meaning, and perception, with a focus on establishing a foundation of meaning based on perceptual processes rather than linguistic ones. Singer and Albertazzi propose models that connect phenomenal and conceptual filling, such as figure completion illusions and poetic content.

5. Perception in Art, Design, and Computation (Chapters 12-13): The final section explores the role of perception in artistic practices, design, and computational models. It highlights how artists like Paul Cézanne utilize principles akin to Gestalt psychology to create meaningful works that defy easy quantification. Additionally, it discusses generative art as an example of information discovery through perceptual processes independent of explicit knowledge or direct sensory input.

Overall, "Perception beyond Inference" offers a multidisciplinary exploration of perceptual experience, emphasizing its foundational role in shaping our understanding of the world. The book's contributors challenge naive realism by illustrating how perception actively constructs meaning from the environment, rather than passively reflecting it. By integrating perspectives from philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, and art, this work serves as a valuable resource for both experts and those new to the field, providing insights into the complexities of human perception and its role in our quest for meaning.


### 21-The Gestural Imagination_ Toward a Phenomenology of Duration in the Art of Chinese Writing

Title: The Gestural Imagination: Toward a Phenomenology of Duration in the Art of Chinese Writing

Author: Stephen J. Goldberg

Journal: Comparative and Continental Philosophy, Volume 1, Issue 2, 2009

This essay by Stephen J. Goldberg explores the nature of shufa, or Chinese "art of writing," emphasizing its unique ontological grounding as a durational transcription of an inscriptional event. It distinguishes this from ordinary writing (xiezi), where attention is focused on lexical meaning rather than the viewing process.

1. Distinction between shufa and xiezi:
   - Shufa, or Chinese art of writing, refers to a specific aesthetic practice that focuses on the visual expression and form of characters, while ordinary writing (xiezi) prioritizes lexical meaning.
   - The pervasiveness of Chinese characters across various social spaces in China makes defining shufa as an aesthetic object complex.

2. Durational Transcription and Indexical Trace:
   - Shufa is characterized by its continuous, durational transcription of brushstrokes that directly transform ink, creating indexical traces of the calligrapher's gestural expression.
   - This analog medium (writing brush) captures subtle nuances of movement and pressure as a continuous transformation, forming an autographical record in space of a temporal event.

3. Time Consciousness in Aesthetic Reception:
   - Viewing a calligraphic inscription unfolding in time raises questions about the dual aspects of duration and unity in temporal consciousness.
   - Husserl's theory of time consciousness is applied, suggesting that our perceptual awareness of an inscription involves three elements: immediate impression (current stage), retention (previous stages), and protention (anticipation of future stages).

4. Dynamical Systems Theory Model:
   - A dynamical systems theory-based model of cognitive processes and affective response is proposed to explain the perception of Chinese calligraphy in time.
   - This model suggests that momentary awareness of an inscription is shaped by retention of past stages, while protention (anticipation) is conditioned by current state and intrinsic dynamics of the inscription structure.

5. Affectual Response and Emotional Tone:
   - The force of the indeterminate and contingent nature within calligraphy appeals to viewers' affectual response, engaging their sensorimotor and proprioceptive imagination.
   - As we engage with a calligraphic work, our emotions are evoked by its visual experience and felt responses, creating an interplay between the seer (viewer) and the seen (calligraphy).

Goldberg argues that understanding shufa requires a phenomenological approach focused on perception and cognition. He suggests that this durational transcription model of Chinese writing reveals its unique expressive and evocative qualities, distinguishing it from ordinary writing practices. This essay highlights the importance of considering cultural contexts and historical developments in defining aesthetic practices, thus promoting a nuanced understanding of Chinese calligraphy as an art form.


### 22-Heidegger_s Phenomenology as Transcendental Philosophy

The article "Heidegger's Phenomenology as Transcendental Philosophy" by Paul Gorner discusses Heidegger's unique interpretation of phenomenology, contrasting it with Edmund Husserl's conception. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Heidegger's Phenomenology**: Gorner presents Heidegger's phenomenology as focused on the "way of being" (Seinweise) of entities, rather than the entities themselves. This method is called "phenomenology of Dasein," where Dasein refers to human beings, emphasizing their unique understanding of being. Heidegger's primary concern is with how things show themselves in our practical engagement (Besorgen) with them.

2. **Realist Phenomenology**: The article contrasts Heidegger's phenomenology with Husserl's realist phenomenology, which aims to describe entities as they present themselves to consciousness without theoretical bias. This form of phenomenology seeks to uncover the essences of various entities through a process called "Wesensschau" or essential intuition.

3. **Transcendental Phenomenology**: Husserl later developed transcendental phenomenology, focusing on consciousness itself and its intentional directedness towards entities. In this form of phenomenology, a radical reduction (epoché) is employed to suspend assumptions about the external world's existence, allowing for a focus on the structure of consciousness and its intentionality.

4. **Heidegger and Husserl**: Gorner argues that Heidegger does not deny consciousness but rather reinterprets it within his unique framework. Heidegger's phenomenology is a radicalization of Husserl's transcendental phenomenology, focusing on the being (Sein) of Dasein as the condition for understanding and encountering entities. The term "world" for Heidegger refers to the comprehensive context of relations constitutive of referential wholes, rather than a collection of objects or a universal horizon.

5. **Transcendental Philosophy**: Heidegger's phenomenology is transcendental because it inquires into the conditions of possibility for human existence (Dasein) to engage with entities. This transcendental philosophy goes beyond Kant and Husserl by asking how any form of comportment towards entities—not just cognitive behavior—is possible. Heidegger's answer lies in his understanding of time and the ontological structure of Dasein, which is characterized by projection (Entwerfen), thrownness (Geworfenheit), and concern (Besorgen).

In summary, Gorner's article elucidates Heidegger's phenomenology as a transcendental approach that investigates the conditions of possibility for human beings' engagement with entities. By focusing on Dasein's unique understanding of being, Heidegger reinterprets and radicalizes Husserl's transcendental phenomenology. This interpretation allows Heidegger to address questions about the meaning of being, which he situates within the historical and existential context of human existence.


The passage provided delves into Martin Heidegger's philosophy, particularly his concept of Dasein (human existence) as presented in "Being and Time." 

Heidegger posits that Dasein is not a detached subject observing the world but rather, its being is an issue for it. This engagement with entities within-the-world forms the core of its existence. He argues that the meaning of 'care' (Sorge) constitutes the essence or Sinn of Dasein's being. 

However, the exact meaning of 'care' remains elusive. For Heidegger, understanding Dasein's being necessitates grasping this concept of care. To clarify this, he introduces the notion of 'temporality' (Zeitlichkeit), a more fundamental concept than common time, which is unidirectional and irreversible.

Heidegger distinguishes between two types of temporal experience: 'common time' (Vulgärzeit) and 'original time' or temporality. Common time, as a sequence of nows, is an abstraction. Original time, encountered through our practical engagement with it—like using clocks and watches—has structures such as significance (Bedeutsamkeit), datability (Datierbarkeit), spannedness, and publicness.

These temporal structures enable Dasein's three essential comportments: expecting ('Gewärtigen'), retaining ('Behalten'), and enpresenting ('Gegenwärtigen'). Each of these makes possible aspects of care—anticipation (expecting), memory (retaining), and presence (enpresenting). 

Care, thus understood, is not passive but active. Dasein projects itself towards possibilities (Seinkönnen) ahead of itself ('zukünftig'), coming toward itself from these possibilities. It also retains its past experiences—its 'having-been' (Gewesenheit), which are integral to its ongoing existence. 

The present for Dasein is not merely a fleeting now, but rather, it exists amidst ready-to-hand entities. When enpresenting, Dasein does not simply make something already present perceptible; instead, it allows these entities to emerge into unconcealedness—to reveal themselves.

Original temporality or ecstatic-horizonal temporality is the interconnection of expecting, retaining, and enpresenting. This temporality is 'ecstatic' because it extends beyond itself in three ways: towards the future (anticipation), back to the past (memory), and presently engaged with entities ('bei'—with). These are termed the ecstases of temporality.

The horizon or horizonal schema of each ecstasis determines their 'whereto,' giving them direction. This makes sense of Dasein's existence as care (Sorge), where understanding being is temporal due to Dasein's own temporal nature. 

In conclusion, Heidegger's phenomenology in "Being and Time" radically redefines human existence from a subject-object relationship to an active, temporal engagement with possibilities and the past, fundamentally altering philosophical perspectives on being and existence.


### 22-Natality_ Event_ Revolution_ The Political Phenomenology of Hannah Arendt

Title: Natality, Event, Revolution: The Political Phenomenology of Hannah Arendt

Author: Michael Marder

Journal: Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology

Year: 2013

In this essay, Michael Marder explores the political phenomenology of Hannah Arendt by examining her tripartite distinction between labour, work, and action as it pertains to phenomenology.

1. Phenomenological Labour: This type of labour is endless due to its entanglement with the unending variety of the lifeworld and the non-formal demands of givenness. It reflects the materiality of phenomenological practice, relying on what's given (e.g., perceptual data) to make sense of it. There is no hint of freedom in this reactive response to givenness; it merely acknowledges without questioning the 'how' rather than the 'what'.

2. Phenomenology as Work: This perspective involves the 'fabrication' of meaning, marked by a definite beginning and end. It embodies empty intentionality culminating in fulfilled intuitions. The process establishes connections between intended objects and given phenomena. Teleological, it exhibits ideality by extracting acts of consciousness from temporal horizons, severing their connections, and transplanting them onto transcendental grounds. This leads to transcendental idealism, often oblivious to the materiality it uncovered in its labours.

3. Phenomenology as Action: This instantiation of phenomenology has no definite end but rather a variety of beginnings, as it continuously undermines, de-idealizes, and de-formalizes itself. Shadowing the possibilities of ultimately unachievable human existence, this critical practice thrives on incomplete beginnings and drastic self-revisions.

Arendt's conceptual framework reveals three distinct notions of truth:

1. The first relies on the veracity of the natural attitude, unable to suspend givenness or contemplate its possibilities. Truth lies in what there is 'now' in perception, standing out from the horizon of potentially perceivable things and falling into the focus of sense-giving gaze.

2. The truth of phenomenological work pivots on the traditional idea of adequatio but between cognizing intention and its object, as well as intentionality and lived experience. It suspends the actuality of givenness through epoché in the transcendental field of pure phenomenology.

3. Phenomenology as action adheres to an existential conception of truth found within itself – its possibilities, including those for dismantling and recommencing its own way of thinking. The actor's power lies in fashioning her thought according to existence, affirming our perpetual beginner status irrespective of biological age.

Arendt’s thoughts on beginnings (natality) have political implications:

1. Natality implies the supreme event of human appearance within the world and disappearance at death – a fact that lies beyond conscious control in 'the immemorial past.'
2. The second beginning refers to political action or the institution of polis, constituting a space for public appearance through speech (logos). This logos acknowledges human plurality and is not incompatible with contestation, critique, disagreement, and nonviolent clashes of ideas.
3. The first and second beginnings form a dia-logue mediating any worthy human project, recognizing the impossibility of fully mastering natality or human existence.

Arendt critiques Husserl’s phenomenological project:

1. She asserts that the attempt to transform alien Being into consciousness via turning humans into 'world-creators' (arrogance) is counterbalanced by modesty in acknowledging man's affirmation of a Being he did not create and which remains alien to his nature.
2. The unending activity of reduction, bracketing, de-sedimentation maintains the materiality of phenomenological labour, keeping ideality in check within the maturity of its action.
3. Arendt criticizes foundationalism, arguing that beginnings (natality and political action) un-found and un-ground foundations, rupturing ideal continuity and revitalizing the capacity for new beginnings.
4. She challenges Husserl's de-historicization of phenomenology by advocating for a return to material human existence, rejecting transcendental ground alien to it.
5


The text discusses Hannah Arendt's political philosophy, focusing on her concepts of natality, action, and the role of phenomenology in understanding totalitarianism.

1. **Natality**: Natality refers to the human ability to introduce something new into the world through birth or creation. Arendt posits that natality is the source of human freedom and possibility. Unlike other animals, humans are not predetermined by their nature; instead, they can create new beginnings, which she calls "new beginnings that had never before appeared and been seen in the world."

2. **Action**: Action is closely linked to natality as it is the human response to this condition of possibility. Through action, individuals bring forth something new into the world, thereby asserting their freedom. In contrast, violence, for Arendt, is a negation of this possibility and freedom.

3. **Phenomenology**: Phenomenology plays a crucial role in understanding Arendt's political thought. It involves attentiveness to the distinct modes of givenness of what appears, including multiple adumbrations or perspectival glimpses of phenomena. This approach highlights the plurality of human standpoints and allows for a critique of totalitarianism, which seeks to erase this plurality by imposing a single perspective.

4. **Totalitarianism**: Totalitarian regimes aim to suppress natality and action by eliminating diverse perspectives (what Arendt calls "perspectival knowledge"). This leads to the "melting of dispersed beginnings into a single standpoint," narrowing down the wealth of adumbrations or viewpoints. Consequently, phenomena lose their richness as multiple viewpoints are erased, resulting in an ontological narrowing under political pressure.

5. **Phenomenology and Totalitarianism**: Phenomenology serves as a counterpoint to totalitarian thought due to its emphasis on the multiplicity of perspectives. It allows for a critique of totalitarian regimes that strive to impose a singular viewpoint, erasing the diversity inherent in human plurality. This critique emerges from phenomenology's attentiveness to the multiple ways phenomena are given and revealed through perspectival knowledge shared via speech and action.

6. **The Promise of Politics**: In "The Promise of Politics," Arendt argues that understanding the world is inherently limited by individual standpoints, as one person can never fully grasp reality from a single vantage point. Instead, the ensemble of adumbrations emerges through free sharing and dialogue among speakers, giving us the world in its ontological richness. In totalitarianism, this process is thwarted, leading to non-givenness, withdrawal, and an arresting of development in experience.

7. **Critique of Totalitarianism**: Phenomenology, with its focus on the adumbrations or perspectival glimpses of phenomena, enables a critique of totalitarian regimes that aim to suppress such plurality. It highlights the importance of maintaining space for human self-phenomenalization and meaningful speech and action—elements central to Arendt's political philosophy.

8. **Enlightenment Insistence on Public Sphere**: Arendt's critique shares similarities with Enlightenment thought, emphasizing the importance of public discourse in limiting the potential for tyranny. However, unlike uniform Enlightenment rationality, phenomenology acknowledges multiple logoi or perspectives corresponding to diverse ways of accessing and understanding the world.

9. **Totalitarianism's Destruction of Political Speech and Phenomena**: Totalitarian regimes aim to eliminate political speech and phenomena, making critique challenging due to their non-givenness. Yet, this very non-givenness forces subjects of understanding to turn inward and engage in self-critique regarding their methodology, thereby fostering a more discerning approach to totalitarianism's origins.

10. **Revolution as an Essentially Modern Event**: For Arendt, revolutions are crucial in maintaining political critique and possibility amidst the erosion of phenomenological conditions. They challenge traditional notions by occurring "in broad daylight," subjecting power to public scrutiny and exposing the conditions of possibility for human action and speech.

In summary, Arendt's political philosophy centers on natality (human ability to introduce new beginnings) and


### 22-Rethinking Nature_ Phenomenology and a Non-reductionist Cognitive Science

Title: Rethinking Nature: Phenomenology and a Non-reductionist Cognitive Science by Shaun Gallagher

In this article, Shaun Gallagher explores the relationship between phenomenology and cognitive science from a non-reductionist perspective. The author argues that the classic scientific conception of nature, which assumes determinism and objectivity independent of human experience, is problematic for understanding subjectivity in sciences studying human behavior and cognition (e.g., psychology, cognitive neuroscience).

Gallagher introduces Niels Bohr's ideas on the intersubjective constitution of nature and the role of the observer in physics. This perspective aligns with phenomenology, which emphasizes the life-world (the subjective, pre-scientific context) as essential to understanding even theoretical scientific considerations.

The author highlights that classical reductionism in cognitive science aims to explain human behavior and cognition strictly in terms of brain function, often ignoring affordances – relational properties between perceiver and environment. This approach fails to capture the complexity of embodied cognition, as it does not account for the dynamic coupling of brain-body-environment or the irreducible structure of being-in-the-world.

Gallagher examines debates surrounding naturalizing phenomenology and critiques those who argue against such attempts (e.g., Christopher Pollard). He asserts that these critics often misinterpret Merleau-Ponty's embodied phenomenology, failing to recognize its irreducible character. Instead of reducing subjectivity to a neural representation or the objective environment, enactivist and radical embodied cognitive science consider bodies as lived, experiential structures embedded in biological, psychological, and cultural contexts.

The author emphasizes that rethinking nature involves rejecting the classic scientific conception of nature (partes extra partes objective totality) and embracing an affordance-based conception relative to situated perceiving agents. This shift in perspective rules out reductionist strategies, as it recognizes irreducible structures essential to understanding human cognition and behavior.

In essence, Gallagher proposes a meta-Copernican turn – a reconceptualization of nature and naturalism that allows for the inclusion of subjectivity in scientific explanations of human experience, thereby bridging phenomenology and cognitive science without reducing one to the other. This approach fosters a more holistic understanding of cognitive life, acknowledging embodied, ecologically situated, and enactive agents rather than isolated minds within objective environments.


The text discusses the possibility of a "meta-Copernican turn" in philosophy, specifically within the context of science and the understanding of nature. This revolutionary shift would involve rethinking our concepts of nature and scientific practice, moving away from traditional reductionist approaches that view nature as objective physical reality composed of separate objects or particles.

1. **Transcendental Turn and Copernican Revolution**: The author begins by referencing Immanuel Kant's notion of a transcendental turn, which he likens to the Copernican revolution. This analogy suggests a shift in perspective, where instead of nature being passive and objects existing independently for us to perceive (the Ptolemaic view), we become active agents in shaping our understanding of reality.

2. **Relational Nature**: The author proposes a radical rethinking of nature as relational, situational, and involving agents who perceive and respond to their surroundings. This perspective contrasts with the objectivist view that underpins much of modern scientific practice. Here, the emphasis is on the subject's interaction with the environment rather than the objective properties of objects.

3. **Quantum Physics and Philosophy**: Quantum physics is cited as evidence for this meta-Copernican turn. Its principles, like wave-particle duality and superposition, challenge our classical understanding of nature, suggesting that reality might be more complex and interconnected than previously thought.

4. **Husserl's Project**: Edmund Husserl's work is highlighted as another example of a philosophical project that aligns with this meta-Copernican revolution. Husserl sought to uncover the intersubjective ground of objectivity, challenging the assumption that objective knowledge could be derived solely from subjective experience.

5. **Implications for Science**: The text poses questions about how such a rethinking would affect scientific practice. If nature is indeed relational and situational, does this imply a shift towards non-reductionist science? Would it necessitate focusing on holistic relations (like brain-body-environment) rather than isolated parts? 

6. **Alternatives to Reductionism**: Various alternatives to scientific reductionism are proposed: acknowledging antinomies, embracing complementarity (like Bohr's wave-particle duality), adopting postmodern pluralism, emphasizing the primacy of the life-world (as Husserl and Fjelland suggest), or recognizing a multidimensional existence requiring a multidisciplinary approach.

7. **Critique of Constructive Scientific Activities**: The author critiques current scientific practice, arguing that it often reduces complex phenomena to data-collecting techniques, limiting its scope and potentially overlooking crucial aspects of reality (like the body's role in shaping the mind). 

In summary, this text explores a philosophical perspective advocating for a significant shift in our understanding of nature and scientific practice. It suggests that viewing nature as relational and situational could lead to a meta-Copernican revolution, necessitating changes in how we conduct science—potentially moving away from reductionist models towards more holistic approaches.


### 22-_The immanent logic of human experience__ Reading Hegel_s Phenomenology of Spirit after Lacan_

The article by Robert Stark explores the interpretation of Hegel's "Phenomenology of Spirit" through the lens of Jacques Lacan's 'Logical Time' essay. The primary focus is on the dialectical relationship between logic (reason) and time in understanding human experience, which has been a subject of debate among scholars.

Two main interpretive trends have emerged: logical primacy, as exemplified by J.M.E. McTaggart, and temporal progression, as seen in Karl Marx's analysis. Logical primacy posits that Hegel's dialectic is fundamentally logical, with each moment contingent on the preceding one due to internal consistency. Temporal progression, on the other hand, views the Phenomenology as a gradual unfolding of consciousness in time, with each stage building upon the previous one.

Stark argues that both interpretations are insufficient because they fail to account for the inherent irrationality and capriciousness present in Hegel's dialectic. He suggests that Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological reading offers a potential solution by emphasizing the "immanent logic of human experience," which reduces logical progression to its most exigent contingencies and temporal progression to the sensual immediacy of moments.

However, Stark proposes that Lacan's 'Logical Time' essay provides a more comprehensive understanding. Lacan introduces the concept of Logical Time as a synthesis of logic and time, which acknowledges both their importance in the emergence of adaptive reason and higher forms of consciousness. This construct allows for the integration of irrational elements, such as doubt, into the rational process, ultimately resolving the logical/temporal dichotomy.

The article outlines Lacan's allegorical narrative in his essay, which describes the progression of consciousness through three distinct rational phases corresponding to Hegel's dialectic. These phases depend on strictly irrational elements like doubt, which acquire a positive rational value in the emergence of identity.

In conclusion, Stark argues that Lacan's 'Logical Time' essay offers a more nuanced interpretation of Hegel's Phenomenology by synthesizing logic and time, reason, and irrationality. This approach allows for a fuller understanding of the dialectical processes at work in Hegel's work, reconciling the apparent contradiction between logical necessity and temporal progression.


The text discusses the philosophical concept of 'Logical Time' as proposed by Jacques Lacan in his essay "Logical Time and the Assertion of Anticipated Certainty: A New Sophism," and its connection to G.W.F. Hegel's philosophy, particularly the dialectic outlined in "The Phenomenology of Spirit."

1. Lacan's Prisoners Dilemma: The essay begins with a thought experiment involving three prisoners, each wearing a white disc and imprisoned under conditions that require them to determine their own color based on logical deductions about the colors of others. This scenario illustrates Lacan's concept of 'Logical Time.'

2. Dialectic and Logical Time: The author argues that this problem embodies a dialectical structure, following Hegel's Consciousness-Self-consciousness-Reason triad. Each stage corresponds to a different aspect of the prisoners' thought process:

   - Consciousness (or Sense-certainty): The initial observation and passive apprehension of the sensory data.
   - Self-consciousness: A reversal where meaning is sought within oneself, leading to a hypothesis about one's own color based on others' potential views.
   - Reason: The synthesis of Consciousness and Self-consciousness, enabling prisoners to objectify their thought, attribute it to others, and formulate logical conclusions.

3. Hesitation as Crucial Element: Hesitation is introduced as a critical component in both Lacan's and Hegel's dialectics. For the prisoners, hesitation arises from the necessity of making a decision based on a temporal tension between their own perception of time and the apparent time according to others' actions.

4. Logical Time vs. Narrative Time: Lacan's concept of 'Logical Time' contrasts with narrative or dramatic time (i.e., the progression of events as they are typically understood). Logical Time involves an anticipation that is made possible by ossiﬁcation and logical elaboration, allowing for a meta-reasoning process that can account for reason's inherent discontinuity and transform doubt into determinate negation.

5. Connection to Hegel: The author posits that Lacan's Logical Time shares similarities with Hegel's notion of Spirit (Geist), which represents the perfection of Reason. Both incorporate elements of objectification, prolepsis (anticipatory grasping), and the integration of logical and irrational components.

6. The Act in Hegel and Lacan: In both philosophers' systems, an 'act' plays a crucial role. For Hegel, this act signifies authenticity and the realization of Reason as it transcends individual thought. Similarly, for Lacan's prisoners, the act entails making a forced choice about their identity based on the temporal tension experienced in relation to others' actions.

7. Implications for Understanding Reality: By implementing Logical Time and understanding its role in facilitating reasoning, we can better appreciate how Hegel's Spirit (the perfection of Reason) emerges from a dynamic interplay between individual thought and collective action. This perspective suggests that reality cannot be fully captured by simple logical structures but requires an expanded notion of Reason to account for its complexities and inconsistencies.

In summary, this text explores the concept of 'Logical Time' as presented by Lacan within the context of Hegel's dialectic, emphasizing how both philosophers grapple with integrating logical reasoning and irrational elements to understand reality better. The prisoners' dilemma serves as a thought-provoking illustration of these ideas, demonstrating how temporal tension and anticipation can lead to self-knowledge and, ultimately, freedom.


The text provided is an excerpt from a scholarly article discussing the dialectical process as presented by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, specifically focusing on his work "Phenomenology of Spirit." The author, Robert Stark, explores how this dialectic is understood and applied by other philosophers, notably Jacques Lacan.

1. **Hegel's Dialectic**: Hegel's dialectical process is characterized by the movement from a thesis to its antithesis, leading to a synthesis that transcends but includes both previous stages. This is known as 'Aufhebung' or sublation - not negation in the sense of elimination, but rather a preservation and transformation of what came before (Stark, 2018).

2. **Logical Time**: Lacan's interpretation of Hegel's dialectic, as presented in his essay "Logical Time," focuses on the concept of 'logical time'. For Lacan, this is not a sequential progression but an immanent process where each stage contains its successor (Lacan, 1988). This aligns with Hegel's idea that the dialectic isn't about moving forward in time, but unfolding within the structure of thought itself.

3. **Prisoner and Warden Relationship**: Stark draws a parallel between Lacan's warden-prisoner relationship (where the prisoner is trapped by the warden's logic) and Hegel's master-slave dialectic. In both cases, one party recognizes their subordinate position and internalizes it, leading to a transformation of self-consciousness (Stark, 2018).

4. **The Role of Knowledge**: Stark highlights how Lacan's interpretation emphasizes the active role of knowledge in dialectical progression. The subject must hold all knowledge as potential, allowing for negation and thus advancement (Stark, 2018). This mirrors Hegel's idea that understanding comes from working with and transforming existing ideas.

5. **Aufhebung**: Stark underscores the significance of Aufhebung in Hegel's philosophy - it's not just about overcoming or negating, but also preserving and developing. This process is laborious, requiring dedication to fully grasp its implications (Derrida, 1978; Zizek, 1999).

6. **Immanent Logic**: Both Hegel and Lacan propose dialectics as an immanent logic - a process internal to thought rather than external or sequential. This perspective challenges traditional notions of time and progress, suggesting that understanding unfolds through the dynamic interplay of ideas (Stark, 2018).

In essence, Stark's analysis delves into how Hegel's dialectic, when viewed through Lacan's lens, reveals a complex, immanent logic driving human experience and knowledge. This logic is not linear or external but inherent within thought itself, shaping our understanding of self, other, and reality.

### 23-Elusive phenomenology_ counterfactual awareness_ and presence without mastery

Title: Elusive phenomenology, counterfactual awareness, and presence without mastery

Author: Jakob Hohwy

Journal: Cognitive Neuroscience (Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 127-128)

This article is a commentary on Anil Seth's predictive processing theory of sensorimotor contingencies (PPSMC), which aims to explain the phenomenon of perceptual presence in synesthesia. The author, Jakob Hohwy, agrees with Seth's overall framework but explores some nuances and potential alternative explanations regarding presence, counterfactuals, and phenomenology.

1. Presence:
   - Presence refers to the perception of a veridical scene as revealing a world of objects rather than just perspectival representations. It is an essential aspect of our phenomenology.
   - Hohwy acknowledges that defining presence can be challenging, particularly when considering experiences with identical content but differing subjective veridicality (presence or absence).

2. Counterfactuals and Presence:
   - Seth's PPSMC posits that the richness of counterfactual awareness underpins perceptual presence. Concurrence without rich counterfactuals lacks presence, according to this theory.
   - Hohwy critiques this idea by suggesting that presence might be better understood as an emergent property of hierarchical inference in predictive processing, without needing direct appeal to counterfactuals.

3. Challenges to PPSMC:
   - Hohwy identifies two main challenges for the PPSMC theory:
     a) Elusive phenomenology: The difficulty in precisely defining and capturing presence' phenomenological aspects.
     b) Spatial vs temporal presence: The distinction between spatial presence (the back of an object) involving elements of action, and temporal presence (specious present with protention) which seems more passive.

4. Hierarchical Inference and Presence:
   - Hohwy proposes that presence could be better explained through hierarchical inference, where representations of higher-order invariants identify non-linear flows of sensory input caused by real object interactions.
   - The process of prediction error minimization, which involves implicit model inversion, reveals relatively perspective-independent causes – aligning with the notion of world-revealing presence.

5. Rich-Poor Element and Coexistence:
   - Hohwy suggests that both Seth's PPSMC (rich counterfactuals) and his proposed hierarchical inference-based Presence Phenomenon (PP) model might coexist, modulating presence "upstream" through invariants and "downstream" via counterfactuals and action.

In conclusion, Hohwy provides a thoughtful critique of Seth's PPSMC theory while offering alternative perspectives on the phenomenology of perceptual presence. He highlights the complexity of understanding presence and proposes that hierarchical inference and rich counterfactual awareness might both contribute to explaining this elusive aspect of conscious experience.


### 23-HEGELIAN BILDUNG AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ACTIVE LEARNING IN CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

The article "Hegelian Bildung as an Alternative to Active Learning in Childhood Education" by Saeed Azadmanesh and Khosrow Bagheri Noaparast critiques the concept of active learning in childhood education from a Hegelian perspective. They propose that Hegel's philosophy, particularly his idea of Bildung, offers an alternative to the current emphasis on active learning.

Bildung, as per Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, is a process of knowledge formation moving from natural needs towards rational life. It involves three steps: understanding a general conception of the object, comprehending it through reasoning and universal concepts, and judging the concrete and particular. This process requires children to move away from immediate experiences and familiarity with objects to gain conceptual understanding, facilitated by interaction with others and speculative activity.

The authors define childhood education as a 'primary Bildung,' where the aim is for children to 'enter into the conceptual world.' This means that through their education, children should be able to express their experiences in conceptual language. 

The article then critiques active learning's components—child-centeredness, constructivism, and child's manual activity—from a Hegelian viewpoint:

1. Child-Educator Interaction vs. Child-Centeredness: The authors argue that while child-centered education emphasizes children's interests and experiences, it can overlook the legacy of human reason. In contrast, Hegel's Bildung advocates for an interactive conception in education where educators help children look at their interests and beliefs through abstraction and concept, guiding them to state reasons for their choices.

2. Understanding Historical Knowledge vs. Constructivism: The authors critique radical constructivism within active learning, which holds that knowledge is entirely constructed by the learner based on mental constructs. They argue this view can blur the line between knowledge and illusion since children's experiences are primarily justified through their own language and discourse. 

The authors propose 'communicative-interactive learning' (CIL) as an alternative to active learning, incorporating both objectivity and subjectivity in the process of knowledge formation. CIL aims to facilitate child-educator interaction, understanding historical knowledge, and addressing concrete-abstract affairs. This approach acknowledges children's interests but also emphasizes the educator's role in providing guidance, norms, values, and historical context for learning.


The text discusses a critique of the active learning approach in education, particularly from the perspective of Hegel's concept of "Bildung" (education or self-cultivation) as presented in his work, The Phenomenology of Spirit. 

1. **Naïve Realism vs Radical Constructivism vs Hegelian Bildung**: The text begins by contrasting two extreme views: Naïve Realism (children passively accepting knowledge) and Radical Constructivism (children actively constructing all their own knowledge). It then introduces Hegel's middle-ground view, Bildung. This perspective acknowledges both the role of historical cultural patterns in shaping knowledge and the necessity for individual experience and understanding.

2. **Critique of Active Learning**: The authors argue that active learning, while valuable, overemphasizes children's activity at the expense of the educator's role. This imbalance neglects the importance of presenting certain patterns and contents of knowledge to children. 

3. **Hegelian Bildung Alternative: Understanding Historical Knowledge**: Instead of solely focusing on child-driven discovery, Hegel suggests a balanced approach where understanding historical concepts of knowledge is crucial for comprehending reality. This doesn't deny the importance of cognitive experiences but introduces them in conjunction with historical context.

4. **Addressing Concrete-Abstract Affairs**: The text critiques both active learning and traditional memorization methods. It proposes 'addressing concrete-abstract affairs' as an alternative, emphasizing that while manual activities are important, they should not overshadow other mental abilities like thought and language. 

5. **Communicative-Interactive Learning (CIL)**: As an alternative to active learning, the authors propose CIL. This model acknowledges both the child's activity and the educator's role. It involves communicating with the environment and interacting with others, improving understanding through these interactions. This method recognizes children's cognitive egocentrism and aims to correct it via adult-child interaction.

In summary, this study critiques active learning from a Hegelian perspective, advocating for a balanced educational approach that acknowledges the importance of both historical knowledge and individual discovery. It proposes 'Communicative-Interactive Learning' as an alternative model, emphasizing mutual understanding between child and educator rather than solely focusing on child-driven activity or adult-directed instruction.


### 23-Rethinking Again

Shaun Gallagher responds to several authors who critiqued his essay "Rethinking Nature" by discussing the relationship between science, philosophy, and the concept of nature. Here are key points from his response:

1. Leaving Science to Scientists vs. Philosophical Input: Gallagher argues against leaving scientific definitions solely to scientists, citing Lynne Rudder Baker's distinction between rudimentary and robust first-person perspectives, which she claims cannot be explained by traditional science. He contends that philosophy can contribute to understanding subjective experiences without rejecting scientific objectivity.

2. Methodology and Limitations: Gallagher maintains that methods in every case are limited, shaping the questions they can answer. Phenomenology is just one method, which provides a different perspective alongside other tools like fMRI machines or ethnographic studies. He emphasizes that methodological limitations don't negate scientific progress but rather highlight the need for various approaches to understand complex phenomena.

3. Mutual Enlightenment vs. Minimal Naturalism: Gallagher defends 'mutual enlightenment' between philosophy and science, advocating for a productive dialogue where both disciplines inform each other. In contrast, authors like Vazquez and Wheeler propose 'minimal naturalism,' which prioritizes scientific findings over philosophical questions about nature. Gallagher rejects this as a false dilemma, arguing that phenomenology includes various approaches, including detranscendentalized versions relevant to cognitive science.

4. Integration and Disintegration: Gallagher discusses multi-scale explanations in cognitive science, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging different scales with complementary yet non-overlapping domains of knowledge. This approach allows for integration without reductionism, enabling a broader view of nature that accommodates phenomenological insights and other disciplines.

5. Predictive Processing and Reductionism: Gallagher critiques Jakob Hohwy's narrow reductionist internalist predictive processing (PP) approach, which frames affordances as representations and agency in terms of active inference. Gallagher argues that this approach fails to capture the full complexity of human behavior, as it isolates the perceiver within neural self-models, disregarding embodied, extended, and enactive aspects of cognition.

In conclusion, Gallagher advocates for a nuanced view of nature that integrates insights from both science and philosophy without reducing one to the other. He emphasizes the importance of acknowledging methodological limitations, embracing diverse perspectives, and fostering productive dialogue between disciplines.


The passage discusses a philosophical debate surrounding the nature of subjectivity and scientific practices, as presented in Shaun Gallagher's paper "Rethinking Nature: Phenomenology and a Non-reductionist Cognitive Science" (2019). The discussion centers around the Process Philosophy (PP) perspective, which emphasizes processes rather than static entities.

One of the critiques raised by Robert Pain in his 2019 response is that PP becomes more relevant when viewed from a processual standpoint. He questions how to characterize the processes associated with subjectivity without resorting to neurocentrism or internalism, as proposed by neuroscientist and philosopher Andreas Hohwy.

The author suggests an alternative approach rooted in enactivism and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which originates from the biological framework of autopoiesis or self-organizing systems. This viewpoint understands FEP within the broader context of organisms that sustain themselves, rather than focusing on singular brain processes.

The author highlights some key takeaways from various responses to Gallagher's paper:

1. A consensus seems to emerge regarding scientific practices, suggesting that current methodologies do not need to be abandoned entirely. Instead, there are productive variations within those practices that could potentially lead to a reconceptualization of nature.

2. The jury is still out on whether these variations will indeed result in the proposed reconceptualization of nature.

3. The shift towards relational invariance rather than general laws is emphasized, as this approach better aligns with explanations produced by biologists, neuroscientists, and cognitive scientists.

4. Other philosophers have suggested that laws of nature rarely feature in the explanations of these disciplines, moving away from a classical view where singular causal happenings are reduced to instances of laws applied to particular conditions. Instead, relational invariance admits degrees (Woodward 1997:34).

In conclusion, this summary illustrates the ongoing philosophical discussion around subjectivity and scientific practices. The debate revolves around how best to understand processes associated with subjectivity without relying on neurocentric internalist views or laws-based approaches. Instead, the enactivist perspective that considers the Free Energy Principle within an autopoietic/self-organizing framework is presented as a potential alternative. While the responses suggest that current scientific practices may not need to be abandoned entirely, it remains uncertain whether these variations will ultimately lead to a reconceptualization of nature.


### 24-Isolating primitive emotional phenomenology in the _lab_ of fiction

The paper by Aarón Álvarez-González, titled "Isolating Primitive Emotional Phenomenology in the 'Lab' of Fiction," addresses a significant debate in philosophy regarding the fundamental elements or aspects of consciousness. Specifically, it focuses on whether emotional phenomenology is primitive (fundamental) or derivative (reducible to other forms of consciousness).

The author frames this debate as part of a broader question concerning the basic ontology of psychology: what are the primitive forms of consciousness needed to explain the stream of consciousness and our inner mental phenomenal life? He argues that understanding emotional phenomenology's nature is crucial in this debate.

The paper begins by examining different positions in recent analytic literature: reductivism (emotional phenomenology can be reduced to other forms of consciousness, such as cognitive or evaluative judgments) and non-reductivism (emotional phenomenology is a fundamental variety of consciousness).

Álvarez-González then introduces key arguments from both sides. Montague's (2009) initial non-reductivist argument suggests that emotional experiences have different inferential sensitivities than cognitive ones, indicating an irreducibility of emotional phenomenology. Uriah Kriegel's (2015) reductive analysis proposes six primitive elements of consciousness (perceptual, imaginative, algedonic, cognitive, entertaining, and conative), classifying emotional phenomenology as derivative from these elements.

The author argues that Kriegel's reduction is challenged by Dewalque (2017) and Mitchell (2020), who demonstrate that cognitive and conative phenomenologies are neither necessary nor sufficient for emotional phenomenology. They also present counterexamples of emotions without accompanying desires, which Kriegel considers essential for his reduction.

Álvarez-González then presents his original argument, focusing on contemplative emotions elicited by fiction. He claims that these emotions, when isolated from conative elements, provide a favorable context to examine primitive emotional phenomenology. Fiction-elicited emotions share robust similarities with "garden variety" emotions and can help isolate emotions from other mental states, making them particularly suitable for studying the nature of emotional experiences.

In conclusion, this paper contributes to the debate by arguing that emotional phenomenology is primitive (fundamental) and offering an argument based on contemplative emotions elicited by fiction. The author's main contribution lies in proposing a new avenue for examining emotional phenomenology, which has not been extensively explored in previous literature. By focusing on these contemplative emotions, he aims to shed light on the irreducibility of emotional experiences and their role in understanding consciousness' fundamental elements.


The text discusses the philosophical debate on the irreducibility of emotional phenomenology, focusing on the role of contemplative emotions elicited by fiction. The author argues that while some elements proposed by philosopher Michael Kriegel are necessary for explaining certain aspects of emotions, such as their cognitive bases and hedonic tone, none of these elements is individually or jointly sufficient to account for the entirety of emotional experiences, particularly those elicited by fiction.

The author introduces the concept of 'primitive emotional phenomenology' to fill this gap. This concept refers to an indivisible, basic component of emotions that cannot be reduced to or explained away by other mental states or properties. The author supports this idea through a detailed analysis of emotional experiences during film viewing, specifically using the example of "Manchester by the Sea."

The film's narrative, involving characters and events that don't exist in reality, is used to argue against the sufficiency of Kriegel's proposed elements. The author points out several issues:

1. Perceptual phenomenology (the sensory experience provided by the film) is necessary but insufficient for explaining emotional responses. While it provides the cognitive bases for emotions, it doesn't account for the full range of emotional experiences.

2. Algedonic phenomenology (the pleasure or pain aspect of emotions) is also insufficient. It's too thin to capture the richness and complexity of emotional experiences. Moreover, its inward direction contrasts with the outward focus of engagement with fictional content.

3. The evaluative judgements that underpin our emotional responses, according to neo-sentimentalism, are constituted by emotions themselves. This implies that reducing emotional phenomenology to cognitive bases, algedonic phenomenology, and conative phenomenology would be circular, as it relies on the very thing (emotional phenomenology) it's trying to explain.

4. Conative phenomenology, characterized by value-committed attitudes like presenting contents as good or bad, is not necessary for emotional phenomenology. This is because contemplative emotions elicited by fiction (which are a type of conative emotion) lack a link to action, making the presence of conative phenomenology impossible in these cases.

In conclusion, the author argues that while Kriegel's elements are necessary for certain aspects of emotions, they fail to capture the full complexity of emotional experiences, particularly those elicited by fiction. This necessitates the postulation of primitive emotional phenomenology as an irreducible component of our emotional lives.


The text is a philosophical paper discussing the nature of emotional phenomenology, particularly focusing on its irreducibility. The author argues that certain elements proposed by Uriah Kriegel for explaining emotions are neither individually nor jointly sufficient to account for all aspects of emotional experience, especially in the context of fiction consumption. 

Kriegel's elements include a disjunction of possible mental states serving as the cognitive base for an emotion (like perceptions, beliefs, or imaginings) and algedonic phenomenology, which provides the hedonic tone of emotions. The author finds these elements necessary but not sufficient to fully capture emotional experience.

The paper then evaluates this finding against four prominent theories of emotion: 

1. **Attitudinal Theory of Emotion**: This theory posits that emotions are bodily attitudes directed towards core relational themes (e.g., danger for fear, goal congruence for joy). The author suggests this theory is compatible with their findings since the type of attitude involved in emotion might be sui generis or non-reducible to familiar mental phenomena.

2. **Perceptual Theory of Emotion**: This view argues that emotions are unique perceptions of value, not dependent on cognitive elements like judgment. The author concludes this theory is also compatible with the idea of primitive emotional phenomenology because these sui generis perceptions could be non-reducible to more familiar mental states.

3. **Judgemental Theory of Emotion**: This perspective holds that emotions are axiological judgments. The author argues this theory would be ruled out by their findings, as it necessarily involves cognitive elements (judgements) that could also serve to explain the emotion independently, contradicting the idea of primitive emotional phenomenology.

4. **Motivational Theory of Emotion**: This view posits that emotions are driven by conative (desire-related) components. The author suggests this theory would be incompatible with their findings since it necessitates conative elements, clashing with the idea of contemplative, non-conative emotional experiences studied in a fiction context.

The paper concludes that, despite the various theories proposing to explain emotions by relating them to other mental phenomena like perception, belief, motivation, or desire, none can fully capture the unique, primitive nature of emotional experience revealed in this study. The author encourages further research into articulating an irreducible analysis of emotional phenomenology, aligning with previous claims in literature (by Dewalque and Mitchell) for its primitiveness.


### 24-Teaching Phenomenology to Qualitative Researchers_ Cognitive Scientists_ and Phenomenologists

The article "Teaching Phenomenology to Qualitative Researchers, Cognitive Scientists, and Phenomenologists" by Shaun Gallagher and Denis Francesconi discusses the challenges and strategies involved in teaching phenomenology to different groups of advanced researchers. 

For qualitative researchers in fields such as psychology, nursing, or education, who employ phenomenological interview methods, the authors emphasize the importance of grounding students in basic concepts and terminology without over-reliance on jargon. They stress that the focus should be on understanding lived experience accurately through the epoché process, which involves suspending one's preconceived notions about subjects' experiences. The researchers suggest refining interview questions to elicit precise descriptions of experiences rather than opinions or theories.

The authors highlight Claire Petitmengin's work as a valuable resource for phenomenological interviewing, particularly in maintaining the focus on lived experience and avoiding introducing biases through open-ended questions. They also underscore the constant need to renew the phenomenological reduction throughout the research process to stay within the phenomenological attitude.

In terms of teaching phenomenology to educators and educationists, including PhD students in education fields, two main points are considered: 1) cultivating an awareness of one's own mind (taking care of the mind), and 2) developing strategies for planning research using a phenomenological method. 

For the first point, phenomenology is viewed as a way to educate perspective on reality, reflect on one's relationship with the world, change and refine one's viewpoint, build mental posture, and broaden how one looks at the world. It emphasizes intentionality in consciousness, placing focus on our experiential relationship with the world rather than introspection treating experience as an isolated phenomenon.

Regarding research strategies, the article suggests considering the appropriate time-span of experience relative to the scope of investigation questions. It discusses balancing structured and open-ended inquiries depending on whether the focus is sensory (like wine tasting) or broader life experiences. Phenomenological analysis may involve a mix of strategies, such as investigating immediate post-experience recall or exploring forgotten past experiences to reduce temporal distance between experience and investigation.

The authors provide examples of phenomenological research designs, like studying the relationship between professors and parents in schools using long-term open questions or focused queries about specific therapeutic interventions. 

Overall, the article underscores the value of phenomenology in understanding lived experience across various disciplines and offers practical guidance on teaching and applying phenomenological principles in research contexts.


The text discusses the integration of phenomenology, a philosophical method focused on understanding subjective experiences, with cognitive science. The authors, Shaun Gallagher and Diego Francesconi, explore how phenomenology can be taught to different audiences—phenomenologists and cognitive scientists—to enrich both fields mutually.

1. **Teaching Phenomenology to Phenomenologists**: The authors argue that phenomenologists should be made aware of the various applications of phenomenology, including its integration with empirical science. This transformation doesn't negate the core principles of transcendental phenomenology but expands its scope. Husserl's critique of naturalism doesn't imply opposition to scientific inquiry; instead, he advocated for a sound basis for doing science, which includes empirical methods once phenomenological reductions have been conducted.

2. **Teaching Phenomenology to Cognitive Scientists**: The authors highlight the misconception that phenomenology is merely subjective introspection. They propose that cognitive scientists can use phenomenology as a methodologically controlled alternative to simple reliance on introspective reports. Francisco Varela's concept of neurophenomenology, which involves using explicit phenomenological methods in experimental situations, is presented as a practical tool.

   - **Neurophenomenology**: This approach was demonstrated through an experiment by the Varela group (2002), where subjects were trained in phenomenological methodology during perceptual tasks. The three steps involved—epoché (setting aside preconceived ideas), reduction (focusing on experience itself), and intersubjective verification—led to high correlations between specific brain dynamics, behavioral reaction times, and phenomenological reports of attention.

   - **Front-Loading Phenomenology**: This method involves scientists incorporating phenomenological insights and distinctions into experimental design without requiring subjects to learn or practice phenomenological methods during experiments. An example is the study on neural correlates of sense of agency (Chaminade & Decety, 2002; Farrer & Frith, 2001), which used a phenomenological distinction between 'sense of agency' and 'sense of ownership' for movement to design tasks that elicited specific brain activations.

3. **Mutual Enlightenment**: The authors emphasize the potential for cognitive science and phenomenology to inform each other, leading to refinements in both fields. They use examples like the expansion of 'sense of agency' (SA) from motor control aspects to include intentional aspects related to goal accomplishment, suggesting that scientific experiments can offer new insights into phenomenological analyses.

4. **Constraints and Refinement**: While empirical science can act as a constraint on phenomenology by highlighting inadequacies in specific analyses, it also offers opportunities for mutual enlightenment. Phenomenology can offer valuable insights to empirical science, while cognitive science can suggest further refinements of phenomenological descriptions and distinctions.

In summary, Gallagher and Francesconi advocate for a dialogue between phenomenology and cognitive science. They present various methods for integrating phenomenological approaches into cognitive scientific research, emphasizing the potential for mutual enrichment of both disciplines through a process of refinement based on each other's insights and constraints.

His research focuses on the embodied nature of consciousness and its implications for learning and educational practices, utilizing a methodology that combines first-person reports with third-person scientific approaches.


### 25-Embodied-enactive clinical reasoning in physical therapy

Title: Embodied-enactive clinical reasoning in physical therapy

Authors: Gunn Kristin Øberg, Britt Normann, and Shaun Gallagher

Journal: Physiotherapy Theory and Practice, 2015; 31(4): 244-252

The article introduces an embodied-enactive model of clinical reasoning (CR) in physical therapy (PT), which emphasizes the intersubjective bodily practices between the PT and patient, rather than viewing CR as a mere dialectic of instrumental and narrative practices. This perspective is rooted in phenomenology and enactivism, focusing on the lived body (body-as-subject) instead of the traditional Cartesian materialistic view of the body as an object (body-as-object).

1. Clinical Reasoning (CR) Overview:
   - CR is a professional judgment process in PT that involves decision making before, during, and after clinical sessions.
   - Reflective decision-making is crucial for professional autonomy and continuous learning in PT practice.

2. Traditional Models of CR:
   - Instrumental models focus on gathering information about the patient's body mechanics and function to form hypotheses regarding impairments affecting movement.
   - Narrative approaches emphasize understanding patients' experiences, stories, context, beliefs, and culture.

3. Limitations of Traditional CR Models:
   - These models often view the body as a mere physical mechanism or biomechanical system, which may lead to an incomplete understanding of movement disturbances.

4. Embodied-enactive Model of CR:
   - This model is based on phenomenology and enactivism, emphasizing the embodied nature of both the PT's and patient's bodies as agents actively engaged with each other and their environment.
   - The body-as-subject (lived body) should be understood to be an agentive body that is enactively engaged in its environment.

5. Key Concepts:
   - Body schema: A close-to-automatic system of sensory-motor processes regulating posture and movement for intentional action.
   - Body image: A system of perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs about one's body contributing to an extended consciousness of self.
   - Sense of ownership: The pre-reflective sense that one's body is performing the action.
   - Sense of agency: The pre-reflective sense that one initiates or causes the action.

6. Implications for PT Practice:
   - Distinguishing between body schema and body image can help PTs tailor their therapeutic approach to address specific impairments.
   - Interacting with patients using both explicit and implicit inter-bodily communications, known as "intercorporeity," allows PTs to enhance the patient's conscious monitoring of movements (body image-driven) or promote automatic problem-solving through task rearrangement or hands-on facilitation (body schema-driven).
   - Enhancing the sense of agency in patients can foster independence in daily living, a crucial goal in PT.

The embodied-enactive model of CR acknowledges the active role of both the PT and patient as embodied agents, emphasizing an intersubjective bodily practice that goes beyond mere instrumental or narrative approaches. By integrating phenomenological concepts like body schema and sense of agency, this model aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of movement disturbances in neurological diseases and other sensory-motor or perceptual impairments.


The text discusses an embodied-enactive approach to clinical reasoning (CR) in physical therapy, grounded in phenomenology and enactivism. This perspective emphasizes that the body is simultaneously experienced, expressive, and action-oriented, with biological aspects influencing cognition and perception.

Key aspects of this model include:

1. **Embodied Self**: The patient's embodied self (body schema, body image, sense of ownership, and agency) plays a central role in CR. These components are non-conceptual and inform movement pre-reflectively, yet can also be brought into reflective awareness. 

2. **Intercorporeity**: This refers to an intersubjective, embodied interaction involving proprioception and kinaesthesia between the physical therapist (PT) and patient. It involves understanding each other through facial expressions, postures, movements, gestures, and sensory-motor processes.

3. **Enactive Cognition**: This theory posits that perception is 'for action' and shapes most cognitive processes. The mind isn't just in the head; it's distributed across body and environment, with bodily processes and environmental factors irreducibly contributing to consciousness and cognition.

4. **Joint Actions**: Both PT and patient engage in joint actions and perception-action loops during interaction. They coordinate movements, with the PT's use of her hands involving body schema more holistically. 

5. **Reflection-in-Interaction**: CR involves not just conceptual processing but also non-conceptual and extra-neural factors like touch, movement, and proprioception. The PT makes judgments based on observation of performance, felt resistance, or active movement.

6. **Multidimensional Knowledge**: Effective CR requires integration of theory, research, ethics, practical experience, and personal experiences. The PT plays a significant role in co-constructing meaning with the patient.

7. **Shared Agency and Participatory Sense-Making**: Through mutual coupling of lived bodies, both participants contribute to understanding movement disturbances and potential improvements. This shared contextualized action generates a phenomenal basis for CR, informing patients about their limitations and possibilities.

In summary, this embodied-enactive model of CR in physical therapy underscores the importance of understanding the patient's embodied self and engaging in intersubjective, proprioceptive interactions with them. It integrates various forms of knowledge and emphasizes the role of joint actions and shared sense-making in improving patients' motor performance.


The provided sources are scholarly articles and books that explore various aspects of clinical reasoning, embodied cognition, and physiotherapy practice. Here's a detailed summary and explanation of the key themes and concepts presented:

1. Clinical Reasoning in Physiotherapy:
   - Jensen et al. (2008) discuss the importance of clinical reasoning in physiotherapy, emphasizing the role of expertise, experience, and heuristics in decision-making processes. They propose a model that integrates evidence-based practice with professional judgment and patient context.
   - Kenyon (2013) introduces the Hypothesis-Oriented Pediatric Focused Algorithm (HOPFA), a framework for pediatric physical therapists to use in clinical reasoning. This model encourages therapists to generate hypotheses, collect data, and revise or confirm those hypotheses based on observed outcomes.

2. Embodied Cognition:
   - Merleau-Ponty (1962) explores the concept of "body schema," which refers to the way our body perceives and interacts with space around us. This idea is crucial for understanding how we navigate the world and how changes in body image or self-esteem can impact movement and rehabilitation.
   - Maravita et al. (2003) delve into multisensory integration, showing how our brain combines sensory information to create a unified perception of our body's position in space, referred to as "body schema."
   - Tsakiris et al. (2007; 2006; 2005) investigate the neural basis of body ownership and self-consciousness. They demonstrate how our brain processes sensory information to create a sense of ownership over specific body parts, which is essential for understanding body awareness and rehabilitation strategies.
   - Varela et al. (1991) present "The Embodied Mind," a theory that emphasizes the importance of embodied experiences in shaping cognitive processes, arguing against dualistic views that separate mind from body.

3. Physiotherapy Practice and Clinical Encounters:
   - Nicholls et al. (2012) explore the role of discipline, desire, and transgression in physiotherapy practice, suggesting that these elements contribute to meaningful therapeutic encounters.
   - Normann et al. (2013; 2014) examine contextualized perceptions of movement among individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). They highlight the importance of understanding patients' unique experiences and perspectives in developing effective physiotherapy interventions for MS patients.
   - Øberg et al. (2014) investigate therapeutic encounters with preterm infants, focusing on interaction, posture, and movement as crucial elements of care.

4. Professional Development and Learning:
   - Wainwright et al. (2010) compare novice and experienced physical therapists' use of reflection in clinical decision-making. They find that more experienced therapists tend to rely on intuitive, embodied forms of reasoning, whereas novices focus more on rule-based, evidence-driven approaches.
   - Scho¨n (1991) introduces the concept of "reflective practitioner," emphasizing the importance of ongoing reflection and self-evaluation in professional development for clinicians.

5. Neuropsychology and Rehabilitation:
   - Keppel et al. (2000) study changes to body image and self-esteem following stroke in young adults, highlighting the need for tailored interventions to address psychosocial aspects of rehabilitation.
   - Ogden (2005) presents a case-study approach to clinical neuropsychology, underscoring the value of individualized assessments and treatment plans in neurorehabilitation.

6. Motor Control and Learning:
   - Shumway-Cook & Woollacott (2007; 2012) explore motor control principles and their application to clinical practice, emphasizing the importance of understanding underlying neural mechanisms for effective rehabilitation strategies.
   - Thompson (2007) delves into the concept of "mind in life," integrating biological, phenomenological, and scientific perspectives on consciousness and human experience.

Overall, these sources emphasize the importance of embodied cognition, clinical reasoning, and patient-centered approaches in physiotherapy practice. They highlight the value of understanding individual experiences, perceptions, and neural mechanisms underlying movement to develop effective interventions for diverse populations.


### Gallagher01

Shaun Gallagher's paper "The Practice of Mind" critically examines two dominant approaches in the study of how humans understand others: Theory Theory (TT) and Simulation Theory (ST). These theories propose that understanding others involves either postulating mental states (TT) or simulating one's own mental processes to infer another's thoughts and feelings (ST).

Gallagher argues that both TT and ST are limited in several ways. First, they constrain intersubjective relations too narrowly by focusing on specialized cognitive abilities of explanation and prediction. Second, they draw conclusions about second-person interactions from experiments designed to test third-person observations of behavior.

Gallagher contends that these theories overstate their claims about the primacy of theory or simulation in understanding others. Instead, he proposes an alternative view: Primary Intersubjectivity (PI). PI is understood as a set of embodied practices and capabilities that are emotional, sensory-motor, perceptual, and nonconceptual. These practices form the basis for our understanding of others from early infancy and continue to be primary even after we develop theory-of-mind abilities.

Gallagher asserts that in most intersubjective situations, we have a direct, pragmatic understanding of another person's intentions because their intentions are explicitly expressed in their embodied actions. This understanding does not require postulating hidden mental states; instead, it relies on recognizing intentionality in observed behavior.

He supports this claim by citing evidence for pre-theoretical (non-conceptual) capabilities for understanding others that exist in very young children. These include a sense of what it means to be an experiencing subject, recognition of other entities as subjects, and awareness of similarities and differences between oneself and others. Examples of these capabilities include neonate imitation, which relies on distinguishing self from non-self, recognizing the other as a body like one's own, and mapping the visually perceived motions of others onto one's own kinesiological sensations.

Gallagher also discusses intentionality detection (ID) and eye-direction detection (EDD), mechanisms proposed by Simon Baron-Cohen that allow infants to recognize goal-directed intentions in others without relying on theory or simulation. ID interprets bodily movements as intentional, while EDD allows recognition of where another person is looking and what they are looking at.

Gallagher's main arguments against TT and ST can be summarized as follows:

1. Both theories rely on pre-theoretical knowledge of how people behave in specific contexts, which they claim derives from capacities such as imitation, intentionality detection, eye tracking, perception of goal-related movements, and recognition of meaning and emotion in movement and posture – all part of what Gallagher calls Primary Intersubjectivity.
2. TT and ST propose that understanding others involves postulating or simulating mental states, which Gallagher argues is not the primary mode of interpersonal understanding. Instead, he suggests that most interactions are based on direct, pragmatic understanding grounded in embodied practices.
3. Both theories overstate their claims about the primacy of theory or simulation by suggesting they form the basis for our understanding of others in most cases. Gallagher argues this is not supported by evidence and that PI should be considered primary in both developmental and practical terms.

Gallagher's alternative view, Primary Intersubjectivity, emphasizes the importance of embodied practices in our understanding of others from infancy onwards, challenging the dominant theoretical perspectives in the field.


The text presents a critique of two prominent theories in cognitive science and philosophy of mind regarding how we understand others, known as Theory Theory (TT) and Simulation Theory (ST). These theories propose that our understanding of other people's mental states involves a process of either forming and applying mental theories or simulating their thoughts and feelings.

1. Phenomenological Critique: The author argues that both TT and ST oversimplify our everyday interactions with others, suggesting they are more pragmatic and context-dependent than these theories allow. According to this criticism, we primarily engage in evaluative understanding (e.g., determining appropriate responses) rather than explanation or prediction based on postulated mental states. This argument is rooted in phenomenology, which studies conscious experiences from a first-person perspective.

2. The Limitations of False Belief Tests: False belief tasks are often used to support TT. These experiments involve presenting participants with scenarios where someone holds a false belief about the world and asking them to predict or explain this person's actions based on their false belief. Critics argue that these tests have limitations, such as:

   - They focus on third-person observation rather than second-person interactions, which are considered more primary in understanding others.
   - The tasks require conscious, reflective metarepresentation, while ST posits subconscious mental simulation processes.
   - Children's performance on false belief tests might not necessarily indicate a lack of theory of mind but could be due to cognitive processing complexity or other factors.

3. Mirror Neurons and Simulation Theory: A recent line of evidence supporting ST involves the study of mirror neurons in monkeys and humans. These neurons activate both when performing an action and observing someone else perform the same action, suggesting a neural mechanism for simulating others' actions. However, the author criticizes this interpretation as well:

   - The view that mirror neuron activity generates an internal representation of another's actions is not supported by neurological evidence, as there's no clear separation between observing and simulating in terms of brain activation patterns.
   - Mirror neurons might primarily facilitate direct perception and action rather than mental simulation.

In conclusion, the author argues that both TT and ST oversimplify our understanding of others by reducing it to explanation and prediction based on mental states. Instead, the author suggests an embodied practice of mind, where primary intersubjectivity involves perceptual, evaluative engagement with others in context-dependent situations. New experiments could be designed to reflect this perspective, potentially offering a more nuanced understanding of how we comprehend others' minds.


The text presented is a philosophical discussion on the nature of understanding others, often referred to as 'theory of mind,' with a particular focus on its implications for autism. The author, S. Gallagher, argues against the dominant theory-theoretic and simulation theories of mind, suggesting that our ability to understand others is primarily rooted in embodied practices rather than mentalistic simulations or theories. 

1. **Embodied Practices**: Gallagher posits that understanding others involves more fundamental, bodily practices - movements, gestures, postures, facial expressions, and contextual behaviors. These practices form the basis for more specialized cognitive abilities like simulation or theory of mind, which develop later and are refined through experience.

2. **Primary Intersubjectivity**: Gallagher advocates for a 'primary intersubjectivity' approach. This suggests that our fundamental understanding of others arises from early, innate capacities for shared bodily engagement with the world, which persist throughout non-pathological life. 

3. **Autism and Theory of Mind**: Gallagher critiques the widely held view that autistic individuals have a specific deficit in 'theory of mind' mechanisms. He argues that their social impairments might result from primary disruptions in embodied, intersubjective practices rather than a delayed development of theory-of-mind cognition.

4. **Evidence for Embodied Understanding**: Gallagher provides evidence supporting his argument:

   - Autistic individuals often struggle with understanding the emotional and motoric aspects of others' behavior, which could be linked to issues in embodied perception and action.
   - They may demonstrate difficulties in imitating others or distinguishing between egocentric (self-oriented) and allocentric (other-oriented) spatial frameworks, indicating problems with intermodal integration.

5. **Criticisms of Theory-of-Mind Approach**: Gallagher raises several criticisms against the theory-of-mind approach:

   - The emergence of autistic social impairments often precedes typical developmental timelines for theory-of-mind acquisition, as noted by Rutter and Bailey.
   - While some autistic individuals can perform adequately on false-belief tasks (suggesting intact cognitive understanding), they may still fail to predict others' actions based on that understanding, indicating a dissociation between cognitive comprehension and action prediction.

In conclusion, Gallagher argues for the primacy of embodied practices in our understanding of others, challenging traditional theory-theoretic and simulation theories of mind. He suggests that autistic social impairments might stem from earlier disruptions in these fundamental, intersubjective capacities rather than a specific delay in theory-of-mind development.


### The Oxford Handbook of the Self by Shaun Gallagher, Editor (z-lib.org)

The Oxford Handbook of The Self, edited by Shaun Gallagher, is an extensive compilation of essays exploring various aspects of the self from diverse disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and postmodernism. The book is divided into several sections:

1. **Self: Beginnings and Basics**: This part focuses on historical perspectives, developmental origins, and neural underpinnings of the self. In 'History as Prologue: Western Theories of the Self,' John Barresi and Raymond Martin delve into ancient, medieval, and modern ideas about the self, questioning whether it's a spiritual substance or something that can be explained naturalistically. Philippe Rochat discusses newborn self-awareness in 'What is it Like to be a Newborn?' and Gordon Gallup, James Anderson, and Steven Platek examine mirror self-recognition as an aspect of self-consciousness in 'Self-Recognition.' Kai Vogeley and Shaun Gallagher question the specificity of brain areas involved in self-related tasks, suggesting that the entire cortex might be engaged.

2. **Bodily Selves**: This section explores how bodily processes contribute to our understanding of the self. Quassim Cassam's 'The Embodied Self' examines metaphysical, phenomenological, and epistemological questions regarding body-self relations. He discusses arguments for and against the claim that a person is identical with their body and investigates whether bodily awareness qualifies as self-awareness.

3. **Phenomenology and Metaphysics of Self**: Here, authors address phenomenological, metaphysical, and epistemological problems concerning the self. Galen Strawson's 'The Minimal Subject' argues for a minimal conception of the self as a point of view, while Thomas Metzinger presents the 'no-self alternative,' suggesting that there might be no enduring self at all in 'The No-Self Alternative.' Mark Siderits discusses Buddhist non-self concepts and their implications for understanding personal identity.

4. **Personal Identity, Narrative Identity, and Self-Knowledge**: This section focuses on the nature of personal and narrative identities, as well as self-knowledge. John Campbell explores personal identity in 'Personal Identity,' while Sydney Shoemaker examines what we are in 'On What We Are.' John Perry's chapter 'On Knowing One's Self' investigates self-knowledge, rejecting the idea that it stems from a Cartesian ego.

5. **Action and Moral Dimensions of the Self**: This part explores agency, moral responsibility, and the role of narrative in shaping our sense of self. Elisabeth Pacherie's 'Self-Agency' examines self-agency, Alfred R. Mele discusses self-control in action, and David W. Shoemaker investigates moral responsibility and its connection to the self in 'Moral Responsibility and the Self.'

6. **Self Pathologies**: This section looks at how aspects of the self break down or disintegrate in various psychological conditions. Jose Parnas and Lours A. Sass discuss schizophrenia's impact on self-consciousness, Jennifer Radden explores multiple selves, and Peter Hobson examines autism's implications for understanding the self.

7. **The Self in Diverse Contexts**: The final section of the book considers how cultural, philosophical, and social frameworks shape our understanding of the self. Richard Menary explores pragmatist thought, Kenneth J. Gergen discusses the social construction of the self, Hubert J. M. Hermans presents the dialogical self model, and Elspeth Probyn examines glass selves' role in emotions and subjectivity research. Lorraine Code investigates the relationship between the self, subjectivity, and instituted social imaginaries.

Overall, The Oxford Handbook of The Self offers a comprehensive overview of the complexities surrounding the self across multiple disciplines, providing readers with an understanding of the diversity of perspectives on this fundamental concept.


The text presents an overview of various philosophical perspectives on the nature of self and personal identity, drawing from contributions in a book edited by Shaun Gallagher. The discussion covers several key themes:

1. **Intrinsic Monitoring (IEM)**: This refers to the idea that certain judgments about oneself are highly reliable, particularly concerning self-agency. Information sources like introspection and proprioception can be IEM. While Bermudez argues that these sources themselves are only derivatively IEM based on the reliability of judgments derived from them, it's unclear whether this reduces the reliability of self-experience or implies high reliability for judgments about self-agency.

2. **Body Ownership**: This concept is explored by Jose Bermudez and Manos Tsakiris from different perspectives. Bermudez takes a philosophical approach, rejecting the strong (inflationary) claim that body ownership is a distinct, phenomenologically salient dimension of bodily awareness. Instead, he suggests it's simply a fact about or label for certain aspects of bodily experience. Tsakiris, on the other hand, follows an inflationary view, arguing that body ownership depends on integrating somatosensory signals like proprioceptive, kinaesthetic, tactile, visual, and vestibular signals.

3. **No-Self vs Minimal Self Debate**: This debate centers around whether there is a self at all or if we should accept a minimal conception of the self. Some philosophers, influenced by Indian and Buddhist philosophies (e.g., Albahari 2006), argue for no-self positions. Others, like Aaron Henry and Evan Thompson, find a minimal bodily self in pre-reflective consciousness. Galen Strawson proposes a 'thin' subject concept, identifying the subject with experience itself rather than as embodied. Thomas Metzinger takes an anti-realist stance, arguing that neuroscience does not support the idea of a self.

4. **Personal Identity**: Debates around personal identity focus on questions over time. John Campbell identifies two key issues: causality and the first person. Causality involves understanding how earlier properties determine later conditions, while the first-person perspective relates to using 'I' to refer to oneself. Sydney Shoemaker argues against animalism (that persons are identical with their bodies), defending a classical neo-Lockean view that persons persist through psychological continuity determined by immanent causality of properties, especially 'thick' psychological or mental ones.

5. **Narrative Self**: This concept, proposed by Marya Schechtman, posits that both a person's sense of self and their life are structured narratively. It suggests the self is a self-interpreting being whose behavior is related to past intentions, future goals, and contexts. The narrative self helps shape our identities and actions, allowing us to plan and control our lives, thereby contributing to moral dimensions of selfhood.

6. **Moral Dimensions of Self**: Questions about personal identity tie into broader moral considerations surrounding agency, freedom, and responsibility. Debates often revolve around whether identity matters for moral responsibility—a point challenged by constitutional reductionism (e.g., Derek Parfit). Narrative theories of self often reject this reductionism, asserting that persons are more than just physical and psychological events; they involve intentions and actions.

7. **Self-Agency**: Elisabeth Pacherie explores the relationship between sense of self and agency, emphasizing that our actions can contribute to understanding who we are (self-discovery). She reviews evidence supporting multiple theories of self-agency, suggesting a unified model based on comparisons between intended goals, predicted movements/actions, and actual outcomes. Questions about the reliability of our sense of agency lead into discussions of free will and moral responsibility.

In summary, this text provides an overview of diverse philosophical views regarding selfhood, personal identity, body ownership, and their connections to morality and agency. It highlights ongoing debates around concepts like IEM, the no-self vs minimal self, narrative selves, and the implications of these ideas for our understanding of ourselves as moral agents capable of making choices and bearing responsibility.


The text provided is an extensive introduction to the concept of self, discussing various philosophical perspectives on what constitutes a human person. It highlights several key themes and authors who contribute to this discourse. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Aristotle vs. Mele**: The passage begins by contrasting Aristotle's view of the self as primarily rational with philosopher Alfred Mele's holistic conception. Mele argues that our actions aren't purely rational or irrational, but involve both, including emotional factors driving evaluations for rational decisions.

2. **Self-Control (Akrasia)**: The text delves into the concept of self-control and its lack, known as akrasia (weakness of will). It explains that self-control isn't solely about rational vs. irrational forces but also involves emotional aspects and personal concern for one's conduct.

3. **Shoemaker on Practical Identity**: David Shoemaker introduces the concept of practical identity, suggesting it's more relevant than personal identity for understanding moral responsibility. He argues that action ownership (attributability) doesn't entail identity; actions can be attributed to a person without needing strict identity criteria.

4. **Schizophrenia and Self-Experience**: The passage discusses how schizophrenia disrupts minimal self-experience, affecting one's sense of presence, first-person perspective, phenomenality (what experience feels like), and intentionality (understanding reality). This highlights that our self-experience is intertwined with our metaphysical understanding of the self.

5. **Multiple Personality Disorder (DID)**: Jennifer Radden's chapter on DID explores how this disorder involves multiple, non-intersecting narratives within a single individual. She suggests that personality traits and epistemic barriers (like amnesia) may contribute to these distinct centers of apperception in DID.

6. **Autism**: Peter Hobson's chapter on autism suggests it involves not only self-other relation problems but also self-awareness issues. Autistic individuals often struggle with personal pronoun use, indicating difficulties in co-reference between self and other, affecting their understanding of themselves as selves in relation to others.

7. **Pragmatism on Self**: Richard Menary discusses the pragmatist view of self, emphasizing that what we do makes us who we are. This perspective supports an externalist conception of self, viewing it as distributed through embodied practices into the environment rather than confined within the brain or mind.

8. **Social Constructionism**: Kenneth Gergen critiques traditional psychological and mental discourse, questioning sources like introspection and behavioral observation. He suggests that language use, particularly conversational and narrative practices, generates our sense of self. This approach challenges the concept of an autonomous, rational individual self.

9. **Dialogical Self Theory**: Hubert Hermans presents the dialogical self theory, viewing the other as part of oneself rather than external. The self is intrinsically social and distributed across various roles or positions in different relationships. These positions are not abstract but embodied practices situated within contexts.

10. **Postmodern Critiques**: Leonard Lawlor and Lorraine Code offer postmodern critiques of the self. They argue for a heterogeneous, multiple self lacking unity, shaped by power structures and economic systems rather than narrative control or autonomy. This perspective questions the compatibility between totalizing economic discourses and the complexity of real selves.

11. **Variety in Self Conceptions**: The passage concludes by acknowledging the diversity of self conceptions within philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and other fields. Despite methodological differences (introspection, phenomenological analysis, linguistic analysis, thought experiments, empirical research, etc.), there's agreement that the self is complex and multifaceted, resisting reduction to a single set of principles.

This introduction underscores the complexity of understanding the self, highlighting how various disciplines approach this concept from different angles while acknowledging its intricate nature.


The provided text is a historical overview of Western philosophical theories of the self, from ancient Greek thought to modern times. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Platonism**: Plato posited the soul (psyche) as the essential self, equating it with personal identity. This view introduced the idea of an immaterial substance that survives bodily death and accounts for personal continuity across time.

2. **Aristotelianism**: Aristotle saw the soul as integrated with the body, with different parts performing various functions. The human soul, particularly its rational part (nous), was thought to be separable from the body, though there is debate about whether Aristotle believed this separation allowed for personal survival.

3. **Epicureanism**: Epicurus argued that the self is material and dissolves upon death, with no continuity of consciousness or personal identity. He suggested that fear of death stems from misunderstanding its nature as merely the dissolution of the body's atoms.

4. **Christianity and Resurrection**: Christian thought introduced the concept of bodily resurrection, posing new questions about personal identity, such as the relationship between an immaterial soul and a material body in survival. The Church Fathers offered various answers, with many eventually adopting the view that both soul and body must persist for personal immortality.

5. **Aristotelian Synthesis**: During the Middle Ages, Aristotle's works were rediscovered and studied, leading to a reevaluation of his views on the soul and its relationship to the body. This synthesis influenced later discussions about the nature of personal identity.

6. **Cartesian Dualism**: Descartes proposed that mind (res cogitans) is an immaterial substance distinct from matter (res extensa). He argued for a dualistic view, explaining mental phenomena through interactions between mind and body, raising questions about how these substances relate in the material world.

7. **Naturalization of the Soul**: As science advanced during the Enlightenment, the soul lost its explanatory power, being replaced by the notion of a unified self driven by empirical observations and rational analysis. Locke's relational account of personal identity marked a shift from substance-based views to those focusing on psychological relations like memory.

8. **Fiction of Self**: The question of whether the self is a fiction emerged, notably in Hume's skeptical philosophy. He proposed that there is no simple, continuous self but rather a bundle of perceptions without inherent unity or continuity. This perspective laid groundwork for modern social psychology of the self.

9. **Developmental and Social Origins of Self-Concepts**: The idea that self-concepts develop over time and are socially influenced didn't emerge until the 18th century. Thinkers like Hartley and Reid began exploring this concept, focusing on cognitive development, empathy, and sympathy's role in shaping self-understanding.

In conclusion, Western philosophical thought on the self has evolved significantly over time, moving from ancient Greek ideas of an immaterial soul to modern views that emphasize relational aspects and social influences. Throughout history, key figures have challenged prevailing notions, sparking debates about personal identity, the nature of consciousness, and the self's continuity across time.


The text provided is an excerpt from a broader work that explores the historical development of philosophical and psychological perspectives on the self, personal identity, and consciousness. Here's a detailed summary and explanation of its key points:

1. **Historical Overview**: The text begins by highlighting how various German, French, American, and German philosophers have approached the concept of the self throughout history. Notable figures include Johann Friedrich Herbart, Maine de Biran, James Mark Baldwin, Georg W.F. Hegel, Immanuel Kant, and others.

2. **Herbart's Perspective**: Herbart proposed that the self emerges from an individual's experience of bodily activities. Initially, one identifies with their body and its interactions with objects in the world. Gradually, as cognition develops, one begins to identify more with their thoughts, eventually forming a notion of self or ego.

3. **Maine de Biran's Theory**: Maine de Biran described the human self developing through sensitive (animal) and voluntary stages. The shift from sensitive to voluntary actions provides the basis for children to conceptualize themselves as continuous over time, forming a sense of personal agency.

4. **Baldwin's Developmental Account**: Baldwin argued that children first become aware of others before recognizing their own subjective activity. Through imitating and understanding others' feelings, children construct the 'social self.' However, he acknowledged the under-emphasis on recognition by others in self-consciousness formation.

5. **Hegel's Reciprocal Recognition**: Hegel proposed that self-consciousness arises through a dynamic process of reciprocal relationships where each individual recognizes the other as a self-conscious entity, ultimately relying on others for self-awareness. This idea has significantly influenced both existential phenomenology and social developmental psychology in the 20th century.

6. **Kant's Distinction**: Kant distinguished between the noumenal (unknowable) and phenomenal (knowable) selves, positing that personal identity over time concerns only the latter. He argued that the phenomenal self is experienced temporally and spatially but cannot be directly known; it affects our experience through the unity of consciousness, represented by the 'I think' thought accompanying every experience.

7. **William James's Empirical Approach**: James integrated naturalistic impulses into psychology with his scientific philosophy of the self. He emphasized first-person experiences and claimed that while there is a persistent 'me,' the actual 'I' constantly changes as an active, judging thought within our conscious stream.

8. **20th Century Fragmentation**: The text notes that after World War II, philosophers increasingly viewed the self as a cultural product rather than its creator, leading to rampant scientific specialization and fragmentation across disciplines. This fragmentation resulted in various hyphenated notions of the self (e.g., self-image, self-conception) without a unified understanding or integration.

9. **Prospects for Integration**: Despite the challenges, the authors argue that an integrated theory of the self is possible and should consider three major dimensions:

   - **Experiential Dimension**: Focuses on first-person experiences of self, describing how humans typically experience themselves in characteristic ways that differentiate them from non-human animals.
   
   - **Ontological Dimension**: Examines what kind of entity the self is (if it exists), considering whether it's a thinking substance, material substance, or process constituted by an organism.
   
   - **Social Dimension**: Explores how individuals relate socially to others uniquely, involving infantile social interactions, narrative accounts of identity, practical ethics, and ideals shaping adult self-understanding.

10. **Primary Role of the Organic Dimension**: The authors suggest that the organic dimension should be primary in an integrated theory because it provides unity for human selves through life history, offering a unique, verifiable identity persisting over time and serving as a base for other dimensions' processes.

11. **The Self's Historical Context**: Finally, the text reflects on the historical evolution of Western philosophical self-theories, emphasizing how they often elevated the 'I' to demigod status, attributing various human attributes (unity, power, freedom) to it as a means to explain human nature and aspirations.

The chapter by Philippe Rochat explores the subjective experience of newborns, focusing on what it might be like to be newly born and whether we can attribute a 'self' to them. The author begins by discussing the challenges in determining when consciousness begins due to the lack of definitive criteria, contrasting this with the ease of identifying its end (biological death).

Rochat then turns to the question of the newborn's subjective experience within a general affective and survival context. He emphasizes that infants rely heavily on others for survival, being born in a state of profound helplessness and dependence due to human altriciality (a long period of immaturity requiring care). This dependence is unique in its length and engagement with explicitly conscious caregivers who possess beliefs and communicate symbolically.

In this primary context, Rochat discusses the possibility of a newborn's sensuous experience. He references Jean-Paul Sartre's speculation that early experiential awareness is determined by maternal constitution, sensitivity, and life story reflected in care dispensed to infants. This includes not just meeting survival needs but also transmitting transgenerational idiosyncrasies or family truths through gestures and attention.

The author then addresses the question of what newborns might feel beyond passive reception of care. He refers to Sartre's suggestion that newborns experience their mothers as a pathological structure of affectivity, embedded within them and shaping their internal rhythms of desires and wishes.

Rochat also discusses the historical dismissal of infants' early phenomenal awareness, citing instances where surgery was performed on infants without anesthesia or local anesthetics weren't applied during painful procedures like heel pricks or circumcisions. This dismissal is contrasted with recent empirical findings from the field of infancy research that demonstrate newborns' sophisticated cognitive abilities, affective lives, and capacity for learning and memory.

These findings reveal that newborns have rich emotional experiences, are attuned to novelty versus familiarity, and prefer specific stimuli like moving faces, high-contrast visual displays, and human voices with particular contours ('motherese'). They also show signs of minimal self-awareness, recognizing their own bodies as distinct entities from the environment.

Rochat highlights that newborns' experiences are not chaotic but rather organized around embodied semantics of approach and avoidance, with values such as comfort, pain, relief, and preferences for optimal levels of stimulation (e.g., not too loud, bright, or monotonous). They demonstrate unmistakable orientations towards specific meaningful experiences beyond mere reflexes.

Finally, the chapter refers to Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytical ideas about infantile sexuality and desire as instinctive behaviors in newborns. While controversial, Freud's 'pulsion theory' of psychosexual development offered a comprehensive account of early behavior, grounding subjective life in the experience of the body from birth onwards. However, some aspects like auto-eroticism and primary narcissism require revision based on modern infancy research findings, which indicate newborns possess minimal self-awareness rather than being driven solely by instinctual, non-objectified desires.


The text by Philippe Rochat explores the concept of selfhood and minimal self-awareness in newborns. It challenges the notion that infants are born in a state of mental confusion, instead suggesting they possess an organized sense of self from birth. 

1. **Selfhood in Newborns**: Rochat proposes that newborns have a primitive form of self-awareness, which he terms "minimal self-awareness." This is not a fully formed ego or 'Me' concept but rather an implicit awareness of their body as a differentiated, situated entity among other entities. 

2. **Body Schema and Affective Life**: Newborns display basic emotions (pain, joy, disgust, interest, anger) through whole-body movements, indicating a rich affective life. They have rudimentary body schemas that map their body for action, such as hand-mouth coordination triggered by the sensation of sucrose on the tongue. 

3. **Evidence of Body Schema**: Neonatal imitation of bodily movements and responses to visual stimuli (like bringing hands into a light beam) support the presence of body schema at birth. This schema is topological, not Euclidean, reflecting a spatial structure with focal attractor regions on the body surface. 

4. **Proprioceptive Awareness**: Newborns exhibit distinct sensitivity to their own bodily movements via proprioception and vestibular receptors, indicating an innate sense of self. They can differentiate between touch from others versus themselves, suggesting awareness of a bounded body. 

5. **Ecological Self**: Rochat argues for the existence of an 'ecological self' in newborns, characterized by their active engagement with the environment and their body's functional systems (like feeding). This self is situated, differentiated, and agent-like from birth. 

6. **Mechanism for Unity in Embodied Experience**: Rochat suggests two potential mechanisms that could explain newborns' ability to maintain unity in their changing embodied experience: an innate starting experiential state of acute synesthesia (where senses are not yet differentiated) and the capacity for direct vicarious experience, allowing them to perceive others' actions as if they were their own. 

7. **Synesthesia**: Rochat argues that adult cases of synesthesia might be remnants of innate inter-sensory connections present at birth but pruned during typical development. Newborns, he suggests, may have a rich, conflated sensory experience where various modalities overlap and blend, giving rise to an 'affective' core of subjective experience with values like pleasure or displeasure. 

8. **Mirror Neuron Systems**: Rochat references research suggesting that newborns may possess mirror neuron systems, enabling them to perceive and imitate actions, thereby fostering a sense of sameness between self-generated and observed actions. 

In conclusion, Rochat's theory challenges the traditional view of infants as passive entities, positing instead that they are born with an innate sense of self rooted in proprioception, synesthesia, and mirror neuron systems. This minimal self-awareness, he argues, forms the basis for later development of explicit self-consciousness. However, these ideas remain speculative and require further empirical validation.


The text discusses the concept of self-recognition, particularly mirror self-recognition (MSR), in both humans and nonhuman animals. It highlights the methodology used to study MSR, which involves anesthetizing an animal, marking specific facial features with a non-irritating dye that cannot be seen without a mirror, and then observing whether the animal investigates the marks upon waking and seeing itself in a mirror.

The authors emphasize the importance of rigorous experimental design to avoid confounding factors, citing issues with some previous studies that used different methodologies. For example, a study using rouge on children's noses for self-recognition testing is criticized because it could have involved tactile and olfactory cues, potentially skewing results.

The text also discusses contingency testing in animals, where they seem to monitor their behavior in mirrors. However, the authors argue that simple repetitive movements do not constitute conclusive evidence for self-recognition, as these behaviors could have various other causes (e.g., trying to elicit a response from another 'animal' in the mirror).

The discovery of "mirror neurons" in primates, which fire both when an animal performs an action and observes the same action performed by another, has been suggested as a potential mechanism for MSR. However, the authors note that despite extensive testing, there is currently no compelling evidence that these neurons are involved in self-awareness or conscious mirror self-recognition in nonhuman primates.

Individual differences in self-recognition across species and within species (e.g., humans with certain developmental disorders) are also addressed. The text suggests that even if not all individuals within a species exhibit MSR, it does not negate the significance of the trait; rather, it highlights its complexity and potential variability in expression.

The authors touch upon the relationship between self-recognition and theory of mind (the ability to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, emotions—to oneself and others), suggesting that self-awareness serves as a foundation for understanding others' mental states.

Finally, recent studies on potential 'self-recognizing' species like elephants and corvids (magpies) are mentioned, with caution about the need for replication due to the tentative nature of these findings. The authors note that self-recognition in birds and mammals of different lineages (elephants, cetaceans, and corvids) might indicate convergent evolution driven by similar selective pressures, such as large body size, complex social structures, and large brains with neocortical expansion.


The text discusses the concept of self-recognition, particularly in animals, and the neural correlates associated with this ability. It references several studies on gorillas, chimpanzees, marmosets, and capuchin monkeys to illustrate that while some primates show signs of self-awareness through mirror tests, others do not.

1. **Gorilla Study (Posada & Colell, 2007)**: An adult male lowland gorilla showed interest in his reflection, exhibiting behaviors like sticking out his tongue and moving it around while staring into the mirror. After a period of mirror exposure, he demonstrated self-recognition by investigating a forehead mark placed there. This suggests some gorillas may have explicit self-recognition under certain conditions, but also raises methodological issues regarding potential reinforcement during investigation.

2. **Methodological Concerns**: The study's lack of anesthesia to ensure unawareness of the marking procedure is noted as a limitation. Some researchers argue that general anesthesia isn't risk-free and many facilities avoid it for research purposes. Recent studies have explored whether attempts to conceal the marking procedure are necessary, with mixed results showing no effect or delayed self-recognition in young chimpanzees and marmosets.

3. **Self-Recognition as Strange Conspecific**: Some primates, like talapoin monkeys, respond to their reflection as if confronted with a 'strange conspecific'. This reaction isn't exactly the same as towards another individual but may be attributed to unique stimulus properties of mirrors and potentially the calming effect derived from mirroring behaviors.

4. **Self-Recognition in Other Media**: Researchers have investigated whether self-recognition can occur without the mimicry provided by mirrors, using live TV images or video delays. Chimpanzees recognize their live TV image for target searches and show self-exploration behavior, while capuchin monkeys respond to morphed images of themselves with facial expressions usually shown to other monkeys but fail the mark test.

5. **Neural Correlates of Self-Recognition**: Studies suggest right hemisphere dominance in human self-face recognition using tasks like reaction time to self vs. others' faces or stopping a movie at the transition from famous face to self-face. Neuroimaging studies indicate right frontal lobe activation, with some evidence of bilateral involvement and distributed networks including inferior parietal lobes, cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and anterior temporal regions.

6. **Self and Mind in Neuropsychiatric Disorders**: Conditions like autism, schizophrenia, and Asperger's syndrome show selective deficits in self-processing tasks, pointing to frontal lobe involvement since these disorders are linked with frontal lobe pathology. Patients often display impairments in self-face recognition, theory of mind abilities, and sometimes view their reflections as independently alive or sinister.

7. **Contagious Yawning**: There's evidence linking contagious yawning to primitive empathic mechanisms related to mental state attribution. Those who show contagious yawning recognize their own faces more quickly, score higher on tests of mental state attribution, and have fewer schizotypal personality characteristics. Functional magnetic resonance imaging shows that witnessing someone yawn uniquely activates the posterior cingulate and precuneus, areas related to self-referential processing, theory of mind, and autobiographical memories. 

In summary, while some primates exhibit signs of self-recognition, others respond to their reflections as strange conspecifics. The neural correlates of self-recognition involve various brain regions, particularly the right frontal lobe in humans. Neuropsychiatric disorders show selective deficits in self-processing tasks, implicating frontal lobe functioning and suggesting a relationship between self-awareness and theory of mind abilities. Contagious yawning may be linked to these empathic mechanisms tied to mental state attribution.


The chapter "Self in the Brain" by Kai Vogeley and Shaun Gallagher discusses the philosophical and neuroscientific aspects of self-awareness, focusing on the conceptual issues surrounding the self's location within the brain. 

1. Historical Context: The authors begin by mentioning Karl Popper and John Eccles' 1977 book "The Self and its Brain," which proposed a dualistic view of the mind controlling brain processes, similar to Descartes' pineal gland theory. This perspective was not widely accepted in either philosophy or neuroscience at the time.

2. Debate between Emergentism and Dualism: The book sparked debates between Mario Bunge (emergentist) and Donald McKay (positioning between materialism and dualism). McKay argued that self-experience and brain activity are correlated but not reducible to each other, likening it to the relationship between a computer solving equations and its hardware.

3. Evolution of Self Concept: Over time, neuroscience has advanced in understanding specific brain functions while philosophy has refined the concept of self. The authors emphasize that defining precisely which aspect of the self (e.g., autobiographical knowledge, personal beliefs) is relevant when looking for 'the self' within the brain is crucial for neuroscience research on self-awareness.

4. Varied Self-related Aspects: The chapter notes that neuroscientific theories of self often encompass various self-related aspects, such as autobiographical memory, recognition of one's own face, and theory of mind, without clearly specifying which brain regions correspond to each aspect. This lack of precision leads to conceptual issues in the neuroscience of self.

5. Cortical Midline Structures (CMS): Functional neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies have identified CMS as crucial for processing information related to the self, specifically involving the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in self-referential judgments regarding personality traits. Damage to this area may result in deficits in self-awareness.

6. Critique of Unitary Self-System: Although some researchers, like Northoff, propose a unitary self-system within CMS, the widespread nature of these structures suggests no specialized brain region generates the self entirely. Additionally, various conceptual and methodological issues question claims for a consistent overall self-system in the brain.

7. Methodological Variability: Even when studies focus on specific self-related functions (e.g., self-face recognition), different methodologies and subject groups can identify diverse brain areas involved in these functions, highlighting the complexity of pinpointing precise neural correlates of self-awareness.

In summary, this chapter argues for clarity in defining which aspects of the self are relevant to neuroscience research, as the lack of precision can lead to conceptual issues and varied findings across studies. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding cortical midline structures' role in processing self-related information while acknowledging the complexity and challenges in pinpointing a single self-system within the brain.


The text discusses various neuroscientific findings related to the self, particularly focusing on the sense of agency (SoA) and self-ownership (SoO). Here's a detailed summary and explanation of key points:

1. **Sense of Agency (SoA) vs Self-Ownership (SoO):** The SoA refers to our sense that we are the cause of an action, while SoO pertains to our recognition that a body part belongs to us. The distinction between these two aspects is crucial in understanding self-referential processing.

2. **Farrer and Frith (2003) Study:** This fMRI study aimed to identify the neural correlates of SoA. Participants performed actions using a joystick, sometimes causing movements themselves, other times having an experimenter do so. The authors distinguished between SoA tied to motor control and SoA related to action consequences (e.g., whether the action had an effect in the world).

   - **Findings:** When participants knew they were causing the action on the screen, their anterior insula showed increased activation. In contrast, when they weren't the agent, right inferior parietal cortex (IPC) activation correlated with a sense of other-agency rather than self-agency for joystick control.

   - **Issues:** The authors' definition of SoA shifted between motor control and action consequence during theoretical considerations. This complicates interpreting the results as solely reflecting pre-reflective SoA tied to motor control.

3. **Central Monitoring Theory (or Comparator Model):** This theory posits that the SoA depends on internal models in the central motor system, specifically inverse and forward models. The forward model uses an efference copy—a copy of a motor command—to predict sensory consequences. Disruptions in this mechanism might lead to delusions of control or errors in attributing agency.

   - **Key Brain Regions:** Posterior parietal cortex (PPC), cerebellum, ventral premotor cortex (vPMC), supplementary motor area (SMA) and pre-SMA, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), posterior segment of the superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and insula are all implicated in SoA experiences.

4. **Intentional Binding Phenomenon:** This phenomenon shows that voluntary movements and their sensory consequences are perceived as happening later and earlier, respectively, than they actually do. Increased activation of the supplementary motor area (SMA) or pre-SMA and insula is associated with this temporal binding effect, suggesting a role for these regions in self-generated action awareness and intention.

5. **Key Takeaways:**

   - The SoA and SoO are distinct aspects of self-referential processing, and their neuroscientific underpinnings involve various brain regions.
   - The definition and measurement of SoA can be complex and sometimes confounded in experimental designs, leading to varying interpretations of results.
   - A network of sensorimotor transformations and motor control, along with heteromodal association cortices, subserves our experiences of agency and self-ownership.

Understanding these nuances is crucial for interpreting neuroscientific findings related to the self accurately and drawing meaningful conclusions about self-referential processing in the brain.


The provided text is a scholarly discussion on the neuroscience of self, focusing on two main aspects: "Self in space" and "Social self." Here's a detailed summary:

**1. Self in Space:**

This section discusses how our brain represents and experiences our body in relation to spatial cognition. 

- **Egocentric vs Allocentric Reference Frames**: Egocentric frames are based on subject-to-object relations, focusing on the individual's perspective. Allocentric (or exocentric/geocentric) frames, on the other hand, use object-to-object relations, independent of the agent's position.

- **First-Person Perspective (1PP) vs Third-Person Perspective (3PP)**: These perspectives refer to spatial cognition from one's own or another person's viewpoint, respectively. Cognitive operations differ between these two levels. 

- **Neural Correlates of Spatial Self:** Studies suggest that different brain regions are involved in 1PP and 3PP tasks. For instance, 1PP relies on temporo-parietal processing (as evidenced by activation in the right inferior parietal region during navigational tasks), while 3PP involves superior parietal lobe and right premotor cortex activity. 

**2. Social Self:**

This part delves into how our brain processes self-related information in social contexts, focusing on 'theory of mind' (ToM) and perspective taking.

- **Theory of Mind (ToM)**: ToM refers to the ability to attribute mental states (like beliefs, desires, intentions) to oneself and others, which is crucial for successful communication or interaction. 

- **Neural Correlates of Social Self**: Neuroimaging studies show that ToM tasks activate the anterior cingulate cortex. However, different brain lobes are involved when attributing mental states to oneself versus others (e.g., right inferior parietal lobe for self, left superior temporal sulcus and temporal pole for others).

- **Default Mode of Brain Function**: This hypothesis posits that resting states or stimulus-independent thoughts correlate with a 'default mode' characterized by specific cortical activation patterns, primarily in the anterior and posterior cingulate and medial parietal cortices. This state might reflect continuous simulation or optimization of future behavior.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Core Self**: A transient relation postulated by Damasio (1999) as a brain instantiation requiring medial cortical activation sites, including anterior medial prefrontal, medial parietal and posterior cingulate cortex.

- **Pre-reflective vs Reflective Aspects of Self**: The text challenges the primacy of explicit self-referential processing in neuroscientific studies of self, advocating for a distinction between reflective (task-oriented) and pre-reflective (everyday experiences) aspects of self.

- **First-Person Perspective (FPP)**: This is suggested to be an ecological phenomenon, providing information about both the perceived object/environment and the experiencing subject, and possibly rooted in sensorimotor integrative processes involving efference and reafference. 

The authors emphasize the importance of precisely defining aspects of self under study in neuroscientific research to avoid category mistakes like searching for 'self' strictly within the brain rather than understanding what happens when the self-as-subject interacts with its environment, social contexts, and specific actions.


Title: The Embodied Self - Quassim Cassam (Chapter 5)

1. Introduction
   - Descartes' view of self as a thinking, unextended substance distinct from the extended, unthinking body.
   - Three main questions regarding self and body: (M) Relation between person and body, (P) Nature of bodily awareness, and (E) Special nature of bodily knowledge.

2. The Body and the Self
   - Discussion on Descartes' dualism, which posits a distinct immaterial self from a physical body.
   - Critique of dualism due to lack of criteria for identity and singularity of souls, as well as challenges in causally closed worldview.
   - Introduction of constitutionalism, a materialist view asserting that persons are constituted by bodies without being identical to them.
   - Arguments against body-identity (death argument: post-mortem survival of the body doesn't imply self's survival; bodily transfer argument: changing bodies doesn't negate identity).

3. Bodily Awareness
   - Examination of proprioception, a type of non-visual awareness of body position and movement.
   - Introduction of multiple-object vs. sole-object views of bodily awareness: the former allows for potential awareness of others' body parts, while the latter argues it's illusory or hallucinatory.
   - Discussion on whether bodily sensations constitute self-awareness as a subject by fulfilling conditions (a) being one's point of view on the world, (b) bearer of sensations and other mental states, and (c) non-misidentifiable awareness.

4. Summary and Analysis
   - Cassam explores philosophical debates surrounding selfhood and bodily experiences, specifically focusing on:
      a. Descartes' dualism and its critiques.
      b. Constitutionalism as an alternative to dualism, maintaining materialism while acknowledging distinctness between person and body.
      c. The nature of bodily awareness, including proprioception, sensation, and the controversy over sole-object vs. multiple-object views.
      d. Analysis of conditions for self-awareness in relation to bodily experiences.

   - Key points: Bodily awareness is a complex phenomenon encompassing various forms (proprioception, sensation), and it's still debated whether this constitutes self-awareness as a subject. Cassam argues that bodily awareness involves perceiving one's body as an object with specific qualities like shape, extension, solidity, boundaries, and spatial orientation. The self, in this view, is fundamentally embodied.


The text discusses the nature and types of bodily awareness, proposing a taxonomy to categorize different forms of body-relative information. This information can be either conscious or non-conscious and is further divided into first-person (from the inside) and third-person (external viewpoint) perspectives.

1. Third-person bodily awareness: These are conscious forms of body perception that function similarly to our sensory modalities for other physical objects, such as vision, touch, or smell. Examples include observing one's body in a mirror or feeling the texture of an object with hands.

2. First-person bodily awareness: These are special ways to find out about our bodies from the inside and include various types:

   a. Proprioception (sensory feedback) - Conscious information about limb position, movement, and balance, primarily monitored by muscles, tendons, and joints. It also includes non-conscious elements like vestibular system monitoring for balance.
   
   b. Interoception - Awareness of internal body states (e.g., hunger, thirst, or pain), which is typically non-conscious but can become conscious in certain situations.
   
   c. Visual proprioception - Self-specifying visual information derived from the field of view that represents one's own body as the origin and perspective of perception, including structural invariants, visual kinesthesis, and affordances.
   
   d. Affective body image - Conscious evaluative and emotional dimensions associated with self-perception. This can be influenced by disorders like bulimia or anorexia.
   
   e. Beliefs about the body - Third-person information about one's body structure, function, and cultural beliefs that may influence self-perception.
   
   f. Semantic knowledge of body parts - Third-person information about names and functions of different body parts.

The taxonomy also distinguishes between conceptual (integrated with the propositional attitude system for reflection, planning, emotional responses) and non-conceptual (more closely tied to online control of action) representations of the body.

Understanding these various types of bodily awareness is crucial in exploring how they function as forms of self-consciousness, particularly focusing on their immunity to error through misidentification relative to the first-person pronoun. This property, along with other requirements, qualifies certain forms of bodily awareness as basic types of self-consciousness.


This text discusses two conceptions of the 'sense of ownership' regarding one's body, known as the deflationary and inflationary views. 

1. Deflationary Conception (as described by Jerome Dokic): This view posits that the sense of ownership is a label for a higher-order property of somatosensation. It suggests that bodily experiences are always experienced within the confines of one's body, making the idea of feeling pain in someone else's limb difficult to conceive. This conception emphasizes descriptive facts about phenomenology and judgments of ownership based on those sensations.

2. Inflationary Conception (as described by Shaun Gallagher): This perspective asserts that bodily awareness incorporates a specific 'feeling of myness.' It argues that this feeling is both present in bodily awareness and introspection, serving as a first-order phenomenal aspect of experience.

The author critiques the inflationary conception, suggesting that its arguments for the existence of a feeling of 'myness' are not convincing. Pathological cases like alien hand syndrome do not necessarily imply a lack of ownership; patients might deny owning their hand due to various reasons unrelated to an absence of ownership feelings. Similarly, introspective reports from amputees using prostheses do not clearly indicate where this 'feeling of myness' would be located if it exists.

The author also references Elizabeth Anscombe's argument against the inflationary view. Anscombe contends that our knowledge about limb position and movement is 'knowledge without observation,' not derived from proprioceptive and kinesthetic sensations. She claims that these sensations do not provide distinct, separable information for identifying ownership since their internal descriptions are too general to ground such judgments reliably.

The author concludes that the inflationary conception of the sense of ownership is unsustainable as it cannot adequately explain where or what this 'feeling of myness' would be, and lacks supporting evidence from reliable sources. Thus, they argue for sticking to the deflationary view, which emphasizes the phenomenological salience of certain forms of bodily awareness without positing an additional feeling of ownership.

The text then shifts focus to discussing bodily awareness as a form of self-consciousness. The author argues that first-person bodily awareness qualifies as self-consciousness due to its immunity to error through misidentification (IEM property). This IEM property is demonstrated by certain types of body-relative information, including position sense, interoception, movement sense, and visual proprioception. These sources give rise to judgments with the IEM property – they provide information only about the self, so knowing a property through them entails knowing that we ourselves have it. The author suggests this is crucial for something to be considered a form of self-consciousness, and that these forms of bodily awareness are indeed conscious due to their generation of conscious phenomenology that serves as evidence for first-person judgments with the IEM property.


The text discusses the concept of body ownership, focusing on the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) as a method to investigate this phenomenon. Here's a detailed summary and explanation:

1. **Background**: Research on the bodily self has recently started exploring how the link between a physical body and the experience of that body as "mine" is developed, maintained, or disturbed. The sense of body ownership refers to the special perceptual status of one's own body, making bodily sensations seem unique to oneself.

2. **Challenges in studying body ownership**: Classical experimental designs often involve direct comparison between conditions where a phenomenon is present or absent. However, experimentally manipulating body ownership directly seems problematic due to its continuous nature. Traditional studies focused on self-recognition in humans and non-human primates but didn't explicitly target the feeling of agency and body ownership itself.

3. **Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI)**: The RHI is an experimental paradigm that allows controlled manipulation of body ownership. In this illusion, watching a rubber hand being stroked synchronously with one's own unseen hand causes the rubber hand to be attributed to one's own body. This illusion doesn't occur when the rubber hand is stroked asynchronously. The RHI has been replicated and modified in various studies, making it a viable method for scientific investigation of body ownership.

4. **Phenomenology and psychometrics**: Phenomenological descriptions of embodiment exist, but operational definitions and measures for rigorous empirical research are lacking. Longo et al. (2008) applied psychometric methods to structured introspective reports during the RHI. They found distinct dissociable components of the experience: ownership (the rubber hand as part of one's body), location (the rubber and real hands being in the same place), and agency (control over the rubber hand). These components predict proprioceptive drift, a behavioral correlate of the RHI.

5. **Implications of RHI**: The RHI demonstrates that multisensory stimulation can alter the experience of body ownership. Ownership leads to perceived similarity between the rubber hand and real hand, suggesting incorporation rather than simple addition of a new limb. Physiological data support this, showing changes in skin temperature regulation of the real hand during the RHI, indicating that experienced ownership affects real body-parts.

6. **Bottom-up explanation**: The RHI reflects multisensory processing and intermodal matching between vision, touch, and proprioception. Botvinick and Cohen (1998) proposed a bottom-up explanation suggesting that intermodal matching is sufficient for self-attribution of the rubber hand. Armel and Ramachandran (2003) extended this view, arguing that any object can be experienced as part of one's body if appropriate visuo-tactile correlations are present.

In summary, the RHI is a valuable tool for investigating


The text discusses a neurocognitive model of body ownership, specifically focusing on the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI). This model integrates multisensory input with internal models or representations of the body. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Body Model**: The right temporal-parietal junction (rTPJ) is proposed to underpin an abstract, normative body-model that maintains a coherent sense of one's body distinct from non-corporeal objects. Damage or disruption in this region can result in various body-related issues like denial of ownership of limbs, neglect of body parts, and impaired self-recognition for body parts.

2. **Body State**: The primary and secondary somatosensory cortices are suggested to maintain a representation of the current state of one's body, including anatomical and postural features. This representation can prevent the RHI if there is a discrepancy between visual input and actual hand position or if the rubber hand is anatomically incongruent with the participant's hand.

3. **Body-Related Multisensory Integration**: When an external object passes the test-for-fit with the body model and matches the current body state, synchronized visuo-tactile stimulation can induce the RHI. This process involves bilateral activity in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). The PPC integrates multisensory information regarding the rubber hand before the illusion's onset, resolving conflicts between visual and tactile information and recalibrating their coordinate systems. PMv shows additional multisensory responses during the RHI, suggesting enhanced responses of bimodal neurons once their reference frame is centered on the rubber hand, leading to the referral of touch sensations onto it.

4. **Subjective Experience of Body Ownership**: The right posterior insula is linked to the experience of body ownership. Its activity correlates positively with the degree of proprioceptive drift during the RHI, indicating its role in egocentric representation, agency, and overall body awareness.

This neurocognitive model suggests that body ownership arises from an interaction between multisensory input and modulations exerted by stored and online internal models of the body. It integrates behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging findings to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the sense of body ownership during the RHI.


The chapter by Dorothée Legrand discusses the phenomenological dimensions of self-consciousness, focusing on the distinction between the self-as-subject and the self-as-object. This distinction is crucial when investigating self-consciousness and helps in understanding how the bodily self is constituted as a subject-in-the-world.

1. Self-as-Subject vs. Self-as-Object:
   - The self-as-object corresponds to intentional objects of experience, like objects one evaluates, remembers, or perceives (e.g., the appearance of one's face). 
   - The self-as-subject is the subject of the experience, the conscious being that experiences these intentional objects. 
   - Each act of consciousness has two modes of givenness: an intentional mode where subjects are conscious of intentional objects and a subjective mode where they're conscious of experiencing themselves (self-as-subject). 

2. Intentionality and Subjectivity:
   - Both intentionality (consciousness of intentional objects) and subjectivity (consciousness of oneself as the subject) are non-dissociable aspects of experience, meaning they cannot be separated or treated independently. 
   - Each act of consciousness involves both modes, allowing a person to be aware of themselves as subjects experiencing intentional objects.

3. Transitive and Intransitive Consciousness:
   - Consciousness of the self-as-object is transitive, meaning it involves an action directed towards an object (e.g., evaluating oneself). 
   - Consciousness of the self-as-subject is intransitive, implying that there's no direct action or object specified; rather, it's a state of being conscious (e.g., simply "being" or "feeling").

Legrand argues that understanding these phenomenological dimensions can help clarify the ways in which self-consciousness is experienced, especially regarding bodily experiences and body ownership. She proposes that both subjectivity and intentionality co-constitute each other: subjectivity constitutes intentionality by providing a conscious subject to experience objects, while intentionality constitutes subjectivity through the act of experiencing intentional objects.

This analysis is grounded in philosophical perspectives on phenomenology and self-consciousness, with support from various grants for interdisciplinary research on bodily experiences.


In this section, Doro The Legrand discusses the phenomenological dimension of the self as a bodily subject-in-the-world, focusing on the concept of transparency in relation to voluminosity. 

1. Transparency: Transparency is understood in two ways - invisibility and pre-noetic embodiment (factually anchored but not experienced). The latter is a form of embodied consciousness that shapes mental states but isn't directly accessible through introspection. The transparency relevant to the investigation here is the former, where the body itself isn't an object of perception, yet one's subjective perspective remains anchored to it. 

2. Voluminosity: To avoid confusion with material extension, Legrand introduces the concept of voluminosity - the spatial expanse of the body that mental states lack. Husserl suggests that even a ghostly entity would have a 'spatial phantom' (voluminous) body without material properties. 

3. Experiencing Voluminosity: Legrand argues that one's transparent subjectivity is experienced as voluminous, meaning that the self perceives itself as localized and oriented in space relative to objects in the world. This experience isn't mediated by bodily sensations; instead, it involves experiencing oneself as the seeing subject anchoring the visual field, with a back, front, right, left, up, and down. 

4. Voluminosity vs. Zero-point of Orientation: Legrand contrasts this voluminous self with the claim that vision offers an uncorrupted view of the world independent of the body. The voluminous self acknowledges the bodily presence in perception through its location, orientation, and spatial extension in the world. 

5. Implications: This discussion aims to clarify what it means for one's subjectivity to be intentional while being bodily in a non-metaphorical sense. By focusing on forms of bodily self-consciousness, Legrand intends to shed light on the intertwining of subjectivity and worldly experience.


This text discusses phenomenology, a branch of philosophy concerned with the study of structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person perspective. The authors focus on the concept of self-awareness and its relation to bodily experience. 

1. **Self-Awareness**: The text explores whether every conscious experience involves a sense of self (egological theory) or if there are experiences devoid of this feature (nonegological theory). It's common to find similar responses to both phenomenological and metaphysical questions regarding the self.

2. **Egological vs Nonegological Theories**: Egological theories, like Gurwitsch’s, assert that all conscious experiences inherently involve an awareness of oneself as the subject of these experiences—an 'ego'. Conversely, nonegological theories propose that unreflective conscious experience lacks a sense of ownership or personal identity.

3. **Phenomenology and Metaphysics**: Both sides align in assuming that addressing the metaphysical reality (or illusion) of the self requires understanding how consciousness is structured from an experiential viewpoint. 

4. **Bodily Self-Awareness**: The authors then delve into different forms of bodily self-awareness:

   - **Self as Subject (Voluminous, Located, Oriented)**: This involves perceiving oneself as a volume in space with specific location and orientation. It's characterized by transparency—one knows where they are without explicitly thinking about it.
   
   - **Self as Bearer of Sensations**: Here, the self is understood through localized bodily sensations (like touch or being seen). This form reveals the 'opacity' of one’s subjectivity; it's not an object, but neither is it objectified by these sensations. It's experienced as subjective without needing to be intentionally directed towards something else.
   
   - **Pre-Tactile Bodily Self-Consciousness**: This argues that our usual understanding of bodily self-awareness through tactile sensation is a mistake. Instead, the structure of the perceptual field—our visual world—is fundamental to bodily self-consciousness. 

5. **Reflective Self-Awareness**: The text also touches upon reflective self-awareness (or 'embodied reflection'), where one's body is experienced as subjective but without being reduced to an object through external scrutiny. This form allows for a non-reifying experience of bodily subjectivity.

6. **Analytical Self-Awareness**: It distinguishes this from 'analytical' self-awareness, which involves a more deliberate, reified examination of one's body—akin to how we might scrutinize a friend's face or a scar on our finger. This latter form alienates subjectivity due to its reifying nature.

In summary, the text presents a nuanced exploration of self-awareness through bodily experiences, arguing against simplistic interpretations that reduce it solely to tactile sensations. Instead, it posits multiple forms of self-awareness rooted in our embodied experience of the world, suggesting that understanding consciousness necessitates appreciating the complex interplay between our subjective perspective and the physical world.


The text discusses a philosophical debate concerning the nature of self and consciousness, comparing views from Western phenomenology with those inspired by early Indian Buddhism, particularly Miri Albahari's nonegological perspective. 

Albahari argues that our everyday sense of self is an illusion; there is no self that owns experiences or controls actions. Instead, the impression of self arises from identifying with transient mental and bodily experiences as 'me' or 'mine.' She distinguishes between a mere 'subject' of experience (instantiating perspectival awareness) and a full-blown 'self,' defined as an ontologically distinct, personal owner of experiences.

The authors challenge Albahari's view by arguing that even minimal perspectival awareness necessitates being a bodily subject, not just an embodied one. They contend that prereflective bodily self-awareness is integral to experiencing the world from a perspective. This argument is transcendental and phenomenological, focusing on the experiential reality of a minimal self given in bodily experience.

The authors distinguish between two broad options for understanding the relationship between subject and body: viewing the body as an object belonging to a mental subject or considering it as constituting the subject itself. They argue that the latter view is correct, maintaining that one must be prereflectively aware of oneself as a living body to qualify as a subject of experience, even in its minimal form.

Albahari's account misses this essential bodily self-awareness, which leads the authors to question her sharp distinction between subject and self. They argue that Albahari's criteria for being a subject of experience (perspectival awareness) inherently entail a basic sense of self due to prereflective bodily self-awareness, which involves an experience of boundedness between one's subjective body and the phenomenal world.

In summary, the authors disagree with Albahari's nonegological view, contending that her account neglects the necessary presence of a minimal bodily sense of self as a constitutive feature of perspectival awareness. They argue for the experiential reality of a bodily subject, which they believe is essential to understanding consciousness and selfhood.


The text presents an argument for the existence of a "minimal subject" or core subject of experience, which cannot be reduced further without eliminating experience itself. The author, Gale Strawson, proposes that when one strips away everything from experience except its qualitative nature (i.e., what it's like), the subject remains and is indispensable for experience to occur. This minimal subject is not necessarily self-conscious or enduring; it may be primitive, transient, or lack ethical significance. 

Strawson's argument aims to establish a foundational concept for metaphysics of mind and consciousness without committing to specific ontological views about subjects or experiences. This minimal subject is not in conflict with contemporary scientific psychology, neuroscience, or philosophy of mind, which emphasize the embedded, embodied, enactive aspects of our experiential life within a physical world. 

Key points: 
1. Minimal Subject Definition: The minimal subject refers to the core aspect that remains when everything but experience is stripped away. It's a genuine subject of experience, not necessarily self-conscious or enduring.
2. Experience Impossibility without a Minimal Subject: Experience cannot occur without an experiencer; stripping away the subject results in no concretely occurring experiential content.
3. Metaphysical Significance: The minimal subject is central to metaphysics of mind and consciousness, providing a foundational concept for understanding experience's nature.
4. Consistency with Contemporary Perspectives: Strawson's minimal subject does not contradict current scientific or philosophical views on the embodied, enactive aspects of our experiential predicament as organisms in a physical world.


In this text, Galen Strawson proposes his conception of the 'minimal subject' within the framework of materialism or physicalism, which asserts that every concrete phenomenon is physical. Here are the key points:

1. **Minimal Subject**: Strawson defines a minimal subject as a unity of a certain kind, a dynamic unity or 'strong activity-unity', referring to any entity capable of meeting this criterion regardless of its classification under traditional metaphysical categories (object/process/property/state/event). This concept is intended to avoid the common assumption that subjects are things or objects and instead emphasizes their unity.

2. **Strong Activity-Unity**: He proposes that for something to be a minimal subject, it must essentially be an activity or dynamic unity without implying intentional agency. Examples could include electrons, entangled particles, human beings, or even tables and chairs, though the latter are considered less likely candidates due to their static nature.

3. **Experience is Experience-for**: Strawson argues that experience is necessarily 'experience-for', meaning it's experience for someone or something. This translates to the necessity of a subject of experience for there to be experience itself, without committing to any particular metaphysical view of what constitutes a 'someone or something'.

4. **Thin Subject**: Strawson introduces the concept of a 'thin' subject as one that exists only if and when there is experience. This contrasts with traditional notions of subjects as persisting entities, emphasizing that for a thin subject to exist, there must be ongoing experience. 

5. **Living Moment of Experience**: The living moment of experience is defined as the shortest period during which experience can occur. Strawson suggests it's an empirical question how long this interval is but posits it's likely shorter than what's colloquially termed the 'specious present'.

6. **Fundamental Singleness**: Strawson asserts that any total experiential field (the sum of all experiences at a given moment) inherently entails a single, unified subject and vice versa. This relationship is referred to as 'Fundamental Singleness', suggesting the indivisibility of experience and its subject within the living moment.

7. **TOS (Things of Substance)**: Strawson aligns minimal subjects with his notion of TOSs, arguing they are dynamic unities or strong activity-unities, and rejecting any fundamental ontological distinction between a TOS's being and its properties. 

Strawson's argument is grounded in real materialism, which posits that all mental phenomena are ultimately physical, and he maintains that experience, including its qualitative aspects, is a real feature of the physical world. He challenges traditional notions of subjecthood, suggesting that a 'thin' or minimal view may be necessary for understanding subjects within this framework.


The passage discusses Galen Strawson's philosophical view on the nature of minimal subjects, or "TOSs" (Temporal Oscillating Subjects), within the context of materialism. Here are key points:

1. **Minimal Subjects as Neural Synergies**: Strawson posits that a minimal subject (or TOS) is a synergy of neural process-stuff within the brain, occurring at specific moments. He argues that these subjects cannot exist apart from the experience they produce and vice versa.

2. **The Identity of Experience and Minimal Subject**: Strawson suggests that experience (e) and minimal subject (s) are one and the same. The neural synergy (n) that constitutes e is identical to s, implying that there's no distinct non-experiential aspect to the minimal subject.

3. **Overlapping vs. Distinct**: Despite this identity, it's challenging to determine if e and s are entirely overlapping or distinct entities due to the nature of brain processes. Strawson leans towards their identity but acknowledges this as a complex issue.

4. **Problems with the Concept of Experience (e)**: Strawson identifies issues surrounding the concept of experience, particularly that all portions of physical process-stuff have both experiential and non-experiential aspects. This poses challenges to the notion that e alone can be a TOS, given its definition as wholly experiential.

5. **Panpsychism**: Strawson discusses panpsychism – the view that all matter is experience-involving or experiential – as a potential solution to these problems. He argues that it's more parsimonious than views that maintain a dualistic nature of reality (experiential and non-experiential).

6. **Fundamental Singleness**: Strawson emphasizes the principle of Fundamental Singleness, which asserts that any phenomenon exhibiting strong activity-unity can be considered a TOS, regardless of its seemingly odd metaphysical shape. This principle supports his view that e (and thus s) can qualify as TOSs despite their experiential nature.

7. **The Subject of Experience**: Strawson rejects the notion that minimal subjects have no experiential being, arguing instead for a view where the existence of the subject is identical with the experience it has (the Experience/Experiencer Identity Thesis). This, he claims, solves problems faced by e while also applying to s.

In summary, Strawson's position asserts that minimal subjects are neural synergies constituting momentary experiences. He argues for their identity with experience itself and maintains that they can be considered TOSs under the principle of Fundamental Singleness, despite challenges posed by the dual nature of physical processes. This view is part of his broader materialist perspective that seeks to reconcile subjective experience with a purely physical reality.


The text discusses four main strategies for anti-realism about 'the self': ontological, epistemic, methodological, and semantic.

1. Ontological Anti-Realism (ARS0): This approach denies that selves are substances, claiming they do not endure over time and are not basic building blocks of reality. Two arguments for this are:
   - Focusing on the phenomenology of self-consciousness and related folk-phenomenological discourse, showing unwarranted metaphysical assumptions.
   - Arguing that current physics and cognitive neuroscience suggest relations as more ontologically fundamental than objects or 'substances'.

2. Epistemic Anti-Realism (ARSE): This strategy posits that selves exist in an unknowable realm with an unknowable intrinsic nature, similar to Kant's 'thing in itself.' However, this view undermines the possibility of substantive self-knowledge and the phenomenological certainty associated with self-consciousness.

3. Methodological Anti-Realism (ARSM): This argument asserts that scientific investigation into self-consciousness does not require assuming the existence of individual selves. Instead, a parsimonious framework like 'transparent self-models' can explain phenomena without invoking 'the self.'

4. Semantic Anti-Realism (ARSs): This strategy questions the referential nature of the first-person expression 'I'. It denies that 'I' connects us to an ontologically fundamental entity, suggesting various alternatives like referring to a Cartesian Ego, an objective self, or simply indicating an organism with self-knowledge.

These anti-realist positions challenge the assumption of a substantial self and propose alternative ways of understanding self-consciousness and subjectivity. The author argues that none of these strategies necessitate the existence of 'the self' based on empirical evidence, metaphysical principles, scientific investigation methods, or linguistic semantics.


The provided text is a philosophical discussion by Thomas Metzinger on the "No-Self" alternative - the idea that there is no enduring, unchanging self or 'I' that persists over time. The author explores why this notion seems counterintuitive to us, despite its theoretical merits.

1. **Intuitiveness and Functional Architecture**: Metzinger argues that intuitions are a property of theoretical claims relative to specific functional architectures. Our brains have evolved as information-processing systems with particular representational formats and cognitive styles. When we try to understand a theory or claim, our brain constructs mental models. Some theories 'feel right' because they fit well with our existing beliefs (goodness of fit) and optimally satisfy constraints derived from our model of reality. 

2. **The No-Self Hypothesis as Counterintuitive**: The no-self hypothesis is counterintuitive because it contradicts our deepest intuitions about the self, which are rooted in phenomenological experiences of realness and necessity. These experiences include varying degrees of 'realness' for the same content (like a visual perception or bodily self) and the sense that certain aspects (like the self) are metaphysically necessary - inconceivable as non-existent. 

3. **Phenomenology of Realness and Metaphysical Necessity**: Metzinger distinguishes between the phenomenology of realness (how things seem to us in terms of their degree of reality) and metaphysical necessity (the idea that something cannot not exist). The no-self hypothesis is problematic because it asks us to conceive of a world without our self, from a first-person perspective - a scenario that's phenomenologically impossible for beings like us. 

4. **Conscious Mental Agency**: Our experience of global control (over actions and attention) is closely linked to the sense of selfhood. A truly selfless mental model of reality cannot be actively simulated without dissolving the property of cognitive agency itself, which is intuitively impossible for us.

5. **Critique of Nagel's Argument**: Metzinger critiques Thomas Nagel's argument for an 'objective self' using a thought experiment about the 'View from Nowhere'. He argues that this experiment, when properly understood, reveals act-object equivocations and misinterpretations of phenomenal experiences. The 'objective self' described by Nagel is logically inconsistent and does not accurately represent how our minds work.

6. **Ideological Debates**: Metzinger cautions against ideological debates in discussions about the self, urging for rigorous philosophical discussions and scientific research that are not swayed by metaphysical desires or preconceived notions.

In summary, Metzinger's argument is that while the no-self hypothesis has theoretical value, it seems counterintuitive because it goes against our deeply ingrained phenomenological experiences of selfhood and reality. He suggests that our intuitions about a persisting self are rooted in how our brains process information and construct mental models of the world, and attempting to dissolve these intuitions requires us to imagine scenarios that are phenomenologically impossible for conscious beings like ourselves.


Buddhist Reductionism, as articulated by Mark Siderits, is a philosophical understanding within Buddhism that asserts there is no self (anatta) and the concept of a person (pudgala) is merely conventional or nominal. This perspective distinguishes between 'self' (atman) as a simple part of the psychophysical complex, and 'person' as the entirety of this complex. 

The central tenet of Buddhist Reductionism can be broken down into two main claims: 
1. There is no self: The argument against the existence of an enduring, simple self stems primarily from the impermanence (anicca) of all psychophysical elements. Given that nothing permanent can undergo change, and any entity causing change must itself be capable of change, simple entities cannot exist. This implies there's no self to persist across lifetimes or even moments.

2. The person is a conventional fiction: Despite the lack of an enduring self, our common experience suggests we are persistent individuals with concerns about our future and past states. Reductionists argue that this feeling arises from the practical utility of conceptualizing ourselves as persons, rather than reflecting objective reality. This conventional truth is maintained for its benefits, such as fostering responsibility and cooperation in society, but it also leads to suffering due to our inherent impermanence.

This view employs a two-tiered ontology where only some entities align with ultimate reality, while others are deemed merely conventional or nominal. Chariots, pots, and even atoms (not the ones from modern physics) fall into this latter category. The distinction lies in their lack of autonomous causal powers and identity across temporal changes.

The implications of Buddhist Reductionism include recognizing our 'person' as a useful fiction, which can explain various aspects of human experience without committing to the existence of an enduring self. This perspective avoids both realism (asserting the reality of unchanging selves) and nihilism (denying any reality whatsoever), instead occupying a middle ground where our common-sense concepts serve practical purposes while not reflecting metaphysical truths.

It's important to note that not all branches of Buddhism subscribe to this view. For instance, Personalists or Pudgalavadins acknowledge the absence of a self but reject the idea that the person is entirely a conceptual construct. Instead, they propose some form of emergentism, where a new entity arises from complex interactions among basic components, possibly implying a substance-emergent view in this context.


The text discusses Buddhist philosophy, specifically focusing on the concept of non-self (anatta) and the debate between Personalists and Reductionists within this context. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **Buddhist Non-Self (Anatta):** The Buddha taught that there is no permanent, unchanging self or soul (atta). Instead, what we conventionally refer to as the "self" or "person" is a collection of ever-changing psychophysical elements (skandhas), including physical matter, sensations, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness.

2. **Personalism vs. Reductionism:** Personalists argue that this collection of elements non-reductively supervenes on the psychophysical components, meaning the person cannot be reduced to or identified with any single element, yet it is more than just a conceptual fiction. They claim this view can account for moral properties like desert. Reductionists, on the other hand, assert that persons reductively supervene on elements, implying that once all facts about the elements and their arrangement are known, nothing further needs to be explained.

3. **Fire-Fuel Analogy:** Personalists use the fire-fuel analogy to explain non-reductive supervenience. Fire (person) is not identical with nor distinct from its constituent fuel elements; it exerts 'downward' causation, changing the elements' arrangement and behavior. However, demonstrating such downward causation is challenging, making this analogy controversial.

4. **Circularity Objections:** Reductionism faces circularity objections:

   a. Conventional Truth: It's argued that there can't be conventional truth without persons to establish conventions, yet Reductionism claims persons are constituted by these conventions, making it circular. This is answered by selectionist explanations, suggesting that social structures capable of bringing about socialization into the personhood theory evolved through natural and cultural selection.

   b. Experiencing Subjects: Another objection argues Reductionism cannot explain experiencing subjects without presupposing their existence, which Reductionism implicitly denies. This is answered by proposing consciousness (vijnana) as the subject of experience, even though it's impermanent and not a self.

5. **Yogacara Concerns:** Some Buddhist Reductionists, like Dignaga from the Yogacara school, aim to eliminate all traces of subject-object dichotomies, including the distinction between conscious subject and object within individual experience events. They propose that a cognition has two forms: one for the object and another for itself as something that cognizes.

6. **Other-Illumination View:** This view suggests cognitions are illuminated by other cognitions rather than being self-luminous. This could potentially answer the circularity objection, but it faces challenges regarding infinite regress and the nature of consciousness.

7. **Abductive Inference Approach:** This strategy posits that our awareness of our own cognition comes from an abductive inference based on the cognizedness we experience in objects. However, this raises questions about how to be aware of cognizedness without being aware of cognition itself.

8. **Illusion Argument:** Some argue that the sense of a self or 'I' is an illusion, similar to other optical illusions. This illusion persists due to its utility for systems like ours but can be dispelled with knowledge of its source. In the case of fully enlightened beings, this illusion might be entirely eliminated, leading to a state of 'total blind-sight' where there's no basis for a sense of self.

The text also references various Buddhist philosophers, schools (like Personalists and Reductionists, Prasarigika Madhyamaka), and texts (Abhidharmakosabhasya, Mulamadhyamakakarika) to support these points.


The text discusses various philosophical perspectives on the nature of consciousness and self, focusing on three main thinkers: Albahari, Husserl, and Sartre.

1. **Analytical Buddhism (Albahari)**: Albahari argues that the self is an illusion due to its purported independence from experiences and objects it's associated with. She distinguishes between three types of ownership: possessive, perspectival, and personal. Personal ownership involves identifying certain experiences as one's own, which generates a sense of self-other distinction, creating the illusion of a unified, ontologically distinct self (Albahari 2006). However, Albahari suggests that witness-consciousness—a pure locus of apprehension—is responsible for unifying experiences rather than an independent self.

   - **Invaribility**: Consciousness has a persistent and unbroken nature, appearing to be the same over time.
   - **Subjective Presence**: A felt sense of being present in experiences.
   - **Illusion**: The self lacks reality because it purports to exist independently from experiences, while in reality, it depends on them for its existence.

2. **Husserl**: Initially denying the need for a transcendental ego for explaining consciousness's unity (Logical Investigations), Husserl later modified his views. He still argued that synthesizing contributions by an ego would be superfluous, as unification happens in accordance with intrinsic laws of experience. Passivity plays a crucial role; the ego, as a result of this self-unifying process, couldn't precede or condition it (Husserl 1984).

   - **Self-unifying**: Consciousness unifies itself without needing an external entity like a transcendental ego.
   - **Passivity**: The ego is passive in the face of affections by foreign entities, and its activity results from these uncontrolled influences.

3. **Sartre**: In "The Transcendence of the Ego," Sartre challenges the idea that consciousness needs a transcendental principle for unity. He argues that the stream of consciousness is inherently unified, and any 'I think' accompanying thoughts doesn't cause this unity; instead, it results from it (Sartre 1936). Pre-reflective consciousness lacks an ego but possesses self-givenness, which Sartre later redefined as "ipseity" or basic selfhood.

   - **Inherent Unification**: The stream of consciousness is unified in itself without needing a transcendental ego for explanation.
   - **Pre-reflective Consciousness**: Lacking an ego, this form of consciousness still exhibits self-givenness or "ipseity."

Critique: The text suggests that Albahari's argument against the reality of the self is flawed. It seems she's implicitly endorsing a traditional view of self as an ontologically independent entity, which has been abandoned by most empirical researchers and many philosophers (including Ricoeur's narrative self concept). Instead, the text hints at alternative notions of self that don't rely on such invariance or independence.


The text discusses two primary sources of difficulty regarding personal identity, focusing on John Campbell's perspective.

1. **Causal Complexity**: This refers to the dual causal structures within persons - their physical (biological) aspects and psychological aspects. These two dimensions can seem to operate independently, leading to questions about which should be considered more crucial in determining personal identity. Campbell suggests addressing this by balancing both aspects, giving them equal weight in determining identity.

2. **The First-Person Perspective**: This source of difficulty is unique to persons and stems from the intimate connection between personal identity questions and the first-person viewpoint (the "I" or self). The first-person perspective can destabilize our understanding of persons as purely biological entities, as it implies a subjective experience that transcends physical boundaries.

The text then delves into 'Immanent Causation,' explaining how causality operates within objects without external interaction:

- **Internal Causality**: We usually consider causality as involving interactions between separate entities, like a car hitting a lamppost, where the collision's outcome depends on both the striking object and the lamppost's inherent properties.

- **Application to Persons**: In persons, this internal causal structure is evident in their physical and psychological aspects. The question arises: Should we prioritize the biological (physical) or the mental/psychological aspects when determining personal identity? Campbell proposes a balanced approach that respects both dimensions equally.

The text also briefly touches on how the first-person perspective contributes significantly to our confusion about self-identity, suggesting it implies a subjective experience transcending physical boundaries, which challenges viewing persons solely as biological entities.


In this passage from John Campbell's work "Personal Identity," he explores several key aspects of personal identity, focusing on causality, the autonomy of the first-person perspective, and the notion of objects as mechanisms.

1. **Internal Causality**: Campbell argues that an object's later properties are causally affected by its earlier properties. This internal or "immanent" causality continues even when an object is not interacting with others. For instance, a lamppost's state before a collision influences its state after the collision. This concept applies to physical objects and human beings alike; our health today is affected by our actions (diet, exercise) from earlier times.

2. **Autonomy of the First Person**: Campbell highlights that our understanding of 'I' or the first-person perspective poses unique challenges in identifying what it refers to. Unlike other concrete objects, the term 'I' seems consistent with radical uncertainty about its referent—be it a body, soul, or something else. This is partly due to the token-reflexive nature of 'I', meaning that any instance of 'I' refers to the speaker. However, our understanding of what constitutes a 'person' is typically tied to this first-person perspective, creating a circularity that complicates matters further.

3. **Objects as Mechanisms**: Campbell discusses how our ordinary concept of causation involves not just correlations between variables under interventions but also the idea of mechanisms—ways in which influence is transmitted from place to place. For physical objects, this mechanism often involves their movement. In the context of personal identity, the challenge arises when considering scenarios like that of the Prince and the cobbler, where psychological continuity might be transmitted without physical continuity. This suggests a need for some non-physical mechanism or soul to explain such causal influence. However, Campbell doesn't commit to this idea but instead notes it emerges from dualistic thinking when considering how earlier psychological states could affect later ones in the absence of physical connection.

4. **Eliminating the First Person**: Derek Parfit's proposed solution to these complexities is to eliminate the first-person perspective in our everyday thinking and philosophical accounts. By focusing on sequences of experiences linked to a body rather than referring to 'persons', Parfit aims to reduce apparent arbitrariness in concerns about personal survival and increase empathy towards others' experiences. However, Campbell questions the feasibility of such elimination, given the crucial role of first-person ascriptions in explaining actions and intentions.

In summary, Campbell's discussion underscores the complexity involved in understanding personal identity, particularly concerning internal causality, the autonomy of the first-person perspective, and our conceptualization of objects (including humans) as mechanisms subject to causal laws. He also critiques Parfit's proposal to eliminate the first person, suggesting it might be challenging due to its fundamental role in explaining human action and intentionality.


Sydney Shoemaker's chapter "On What We Are" discusses personal identity and the nature of human beings, focusing on how we understand what constitutes our persistence through time and what kind of things we are. He critiques philosopher Eric Olson's question about human nature, arguing that understanding our persistence conditions provides insights into what we are.

Shoemaker proposes an account based on the idea that properties are individuated by causal profiles and that there is an internal relation between these causal profiles and the identity conditions of persisting things. He distinguishes between synchronic (contemporaneous) unity relations and diachronic (through-time) unity relations:

1. Synchronic unity relates property instances within a thing at a particular time, determined by their joint causal propensity to produce specific effects or confer powers. For instance, the properties of sharpness, hardness, and mass, when coinstantiated in a knife, are synchronically unified as they jointly cause the wood-cutting effect.
2. Diachronic unity relates property instances at different times within the same thing, determined by causal relationships where one instance causes or contributes to causing a successor state of another kind. For example, an object's height today might be diachronically unified with its weight yesterday if changes in weight lead to changes in height due to growth or other factors.

Shoemaker introduces the concept of thick and thin properties:

- Thin properties (e.g., shape, size, mass) can be shared by different kinds of things, while
- Thick properties are specific to certain types of things, often biological, and their instances generate diachronic unity relations necessary for persistence through time. Examples include mental, automotive, and computer properties.

According to Shoemaker's account, a persisting thing is constituted by a set of property instances unified by synchronic and diachronic relations. This account doesn't propose that things are bundles of properties; instead, it suggests that when such unity exists, there is a persisting thing.

Shoemaker argues that understanding human nature involves identifying our thick properties—in his view, primarily psychological properties—and their role in persistence and identity conditions. He supports the neo-Lockean perspective, which holds that mental continuity is central to personal identity and that humans are fundamentally subjects of mental properties:

1. Mental properties are thick properties due to their internal causal connections with successor states within a person's mental history, making them essential to persistence conditions.
2. Physicalism assumes mental properties' physical realization; thus, physical predicates ascribed to persons indicate relationships between the physical and mental aspects of identity.
3. The subject-matter of physical predicates is intimately connected with mental states via perception, action, and sensation, allowing mental properties to determine persistence conditions.
4. In hypothetical cerebrum transplant scenarios, psychological continuity implies that the person's identity transfers to a new body due to the intricate interplay between mental and physical states.

In conclusion, Shoemaker's account posits that understanding our persistence conditions reveals what kind of beings we are: subjects primarily defined by thick psychological properties that establish our identity through their causal connections across time. This perspective contrasts with animalism, which argues for a broader definition encompassing various biological properties, and supports the idea that humans are fundamentally mental entities bound to physical existence via complex relationships.


John Perry's essay "On Knowing One's Self" explores the nature of self-belief, specifically focusing on the distinction between believing about oneself and believing about another person. He uses examples to illustrate that self-belief involves more than just having a belief about the person one happens to be; it requires a specific relationship with the content of the belief.

Perry introduces Frege's problem regarding identity, which highlights how statements involving different singular terms ('A = X' vs 'A = B') can have varying cognitive significance, even if they are factually equivalent. This difference arises because the experiences leading to these beliefs may differ and the beliefs themselves might motivate distinct actions or inferences.

Perry then discusses Frege's later reflections on indexicals, particularly the word 'I'. Frege suggested that each person is presented in a unique way, which cannot be accessed by anyone else. Perry proposes two interpretations: (1) There exists a private property uniquely instantiated by every individual, which they associate with 'I', or (2) Each person has a particular method for knowing facts about themselves – self-informative methods – which aren't accessible to others.

The second interpretation seems more plausible. Perry argues that there are common, though not necessarily reliable, ways individuals learn about their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences (e.g., recognizing one's hunger or the need for a bathroom break). These self-informative methods, while shared among people, cannot be used to gather information about others.

In essence, Perry's argument is that self-belief involves unique access to one's own mental states through self-informative methods unavailable to others. This distinguishes self-belief from beliefs about other individuals and highlights the complex nature of knowing oneself.


In this passage, philosopher John Perry delves into the complexities of self-knowledge, focusing on the nature of 'I' or the first-person pronoun. He begins by discussing Wittgenstein's point that when experiencing a toothache, one is directly aware of the pain but not of oneself as the bearer of that pain. This differs from perceiving others with similar pains where we can see and recognize the person.

Perry then introduces Sydney Shoemaker's concept of immunity to error through misidentification relative to the first-person pronoun. He explains that when wrestling, if one perceives a bloody foot and thinks 'I am bleeding', they may be mistaken because the person bleeding isn't necessarily them. However, if someone sees a canary and says 'I see a canary', it's impossible for the seeing to be misattributed.

Anscombe, another philosopher discussed, argues that the first-person pronoun doesn't refer but rather denotes an absence—one is aware of certain occurrences (like pain or thoughts) without necessarily identifying oneself as the possessor of these states. She suggests that to avoid the implication of a Cartesian Ego (a non-physical self), we should abandon the idea that 'I' refers at all, aligning with Lichtenberg's critique of Descartes.

Perry then explores roles and how they relate to reference and self-knowledge. He introduces the idea of role-based methods of inquiry and action, contrasting them with property-based methods like proper names or definite descriptions. For instance, 'today' refers to the day on which an utterance is made based on its role as the day under current investigation.

The author posits that selves are roles persons play, specifically the role of identity. Just as one's self supports role-based methods of inquiry and action (like finding out about one's surroundings or acting upon them), the first-person pronoun 'I' denotes the person playing this role—ourselves.

Finally, Perry discusses how our cognitive systems operate with a mix of self-informative methods (like introspection) and non-self-informative ones (like using calendars or names). He argues that in an informationally complex world, the ability to bridge these different ways of knowing oneself is crucial. Even though we might prefer to live solely in the present, our daily lives require thinking about past and future events, necessitating a robust self-concept that integrates both self-informative and non-self-informative methods.

In summary, Perry's discussion revolves around the nature of self-knowledge, particularly focusing on how we understand ourselves through roles (like 'today') and the interplay between self-informative and non-self-informative methods in our cognitive systems. He argues against viewing the first-person pronoun as referring to a Cartesian Ego but rather as denoting an absent self—the role one plays in experiencing various states or events.


The narrative approach to the self posits a connection between narratives and selfhood, though it's not a monolithic theory with uniform views. This section introduces two broad categories of narrative views, acknowledging that there are significant differences within each category and cross-categorical similarities.

1. Selves are constituted by narratives: This view holds that selves inherently involve narrative elements, both in terms of how individuals perceive themselves and the structure of their lives. Three prominent philosophers associated with this perspective are Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, and Paul Ricoeur. The hermeneutical view they share emphasizes that selves are fundamentally self-interpreting beings inspired by hermeneutics theory.

   a. Agency requires narrative: According to this perspective, agency demands narrativity. To understand an action or our lives meaningfully and beyond naturalistic terms, we need to place them within the context of intersecting stories—household stories, seasonal cycles, life histories, etc. MacIntyre illustrates this by suggesting that behaviors must be characterized with "equal truth and appropriateness," which requires an ordering in narrative form to see their intelligibility from agents' intentions, motives, passions, and purposes.

   b. Unity of human life as a narrative quest: Both MacIntyre and Taylor argue that the unity of human life is essentially narrative—a quest for goodness. They suggest that selfhood and the good are inextricably intertwined, meaning lives must have a narrative structure to be intelligible.

   c. Ricoeur's nuanced differences: While Ricoeur shares similarities with MacIntyre and Taylor (e.g., human life as a quest), he emphasizes the discontinuities between life and literature, stressing that our lives have more complexity than mere narrative accounts might suggest.

2. The self as a center of narrative gravity: Daniel Dennett offers an alternative view where selves are fictions, much like the concept of a "center of gravity" in physics—a useful construct with a defined role within a system but not an actual entity. Selves, for Dennett, are protagonists in autobiographical narratives generated by human brains (narrative-generating machines). The brain and the human organism it operates are distinct from these fictional selves. This view draws a crucial distinction between the narrating entity (e.g., a human author or a computer) and its protagonist, refuting the idea that the brain or any physical entity is the self.

In summary, the narrative approach to the self posits various connections between narratives and selfhood. Some prominent views include the hermeneutical perspective (MacIntyre, Taylor, Ricoeur), which suggests that selves are inherently narrative beings requiring narrative structures for intelligible agency and life unity. Dennett's view contrasts this by proposing that selves are fictional characters within narratives generated by our brains but not identical to the brain itself. These diverse perspectives contribute to a rich and evolving understanding of selfhood through narrative lenses in philosophy, psychology, and related disciplines.


The provided text discusses various philosophical views on the concept of the "narrative self," exploring how different theorists use narratives to understand human identity, agency, and meaning. Here's a summary and explanation of these perspectives:

1. **Hermeneutical Theories**: These approaches view selves as constituted through narrative in a way that emphasizes interpretation and understanding. They argue that our self-conception and lifestyle form our selfhood, with genuine human selves whose self-understanding shapes their existence. Hermeneutical theorists see selves as real entities shaped by narratives, often involving an ethical orientation or quest for the good.

2. **Daniel Dennett's View**: Dennett proposes that our brains create a fictional protagonist (ourselves) by telling stories about our experiences and actions. He emphasizes tracking the history of our bodies rather than seeking moral evaluation or thematic unity in life narratives. Our selfhood, on Dennett's view, arises from this storytelling activity without necessitating a strong form of agency or ethical orientation.

3. **The Narrative Self-Constitution View (NSCV)**: This intermediate perspective posits that we constitute ourselves as selves by understanding our lives as narratives and living accordingly. It does not require explicit articulation of narratives but involves experiencing present events within a larger, ongoing story context. The differences in background narratives significantly shape how individuals interpret various life events, like winning the lottery.

4. **Narrative Capacity Views**: These perspectives link selfhood to the capacity for narrative thinking and offering narrative explanations. They do not necessitate a comprehensive life narrative but focus on using story-like logic when describing, explaining, and choosing actions. Examples include developmental psychologist Katherine Nelson's research on how children learn to narrate their lives, gradually developing self-awareness and distinctive self-histories through this process.

5. **Emphasis on Meaning and Intelligibility**: Almost all narrative views stress that meaning is crucial for understanding selves. Some argue that mundane intelligibility requires placing actions in broader contexts, while others claim that human existence needs an overarching purpose or theme for true significance. This debate parallels disagreements about whether local purposes can be fully intelligible without broader contextualization.

6. **Normativity, Evaluation, and Agency**: Almost all narrative theories incorporate some form of evaluation, normativity, or agency. Ethical orientation plays a central role in hermeneutical views, where selfhood involves a quest for the good. Other approaches allow broader interpretations of evaluation, such as Gilbert's robot making choices based on maintaining narrative coherence rather than ethical considerations.

7. **Embeddedness and Embodiment**: Narrative views consistently highlight that selves are embodied beings embedded in social contexts where they interact with others. Hermeneutical theorists emphasize accountability within traditions, necessitating placing oneself within historical or communal frameworks for narratives to retain coherence and intelligibility.

These diverse perspectives on the narrative self offer rich insights into how our sense of identity emerges from storytelling, evaluation, agency, and social embeddedness, each with nuanced differences in their interpretations and implications for understanding human existence.


The narrative approach to selfhood posits that our understanding of ourselves is fundamentally rooted in narratives—stories we tell about our lives. This perspective suggests that selfhood is not merely a matter of individual psychology, but also involves social interaction and the interplay between various roles such as character, author, and critic within our life narratives.

1. **Character**: In this role, we view ourselves as characters within our own lives, acknowledging that many events are driven by accidents, contingencies, and coincidences—just like in literature. 

2. **Author**: As authors, we recognize that while not all elements of our lives are scripted, we still have a degree of agency. We make decisions, set goals, and navigate the world according to our values and intentions. 

3. **Critic**: This role involves reflection on our lives, similar to how literary critics analyze a novel or story. As critics, we interpret past events and their significance, influencing future actions and choices. 

Narrative theories of selfhood argue that these three roles are in constant interplay. We are not merely characters whose stories are predetermined by external forces; neither are we purely authors, crafting our lives from scratch. Instead, we are all three: we live as characters, acting and experiencing the world; we make choices and decisions as authors; and we reflect on these experiences and decisions as critics.

However, the narrative approach faces several challenges. One is defining precisely what constitutes a self-narrative—how explicit should it be? Where does it reside (in thought, speech, or action)? And how does it relate to the phenomenological aspects of selfhood, such as the feeling of having a continuous self over time? 

A proposed strategy for addressing these challenges is viewing the narrative self through the lens of these three roles. This approach suggests that the complexity of our selves emerges from navigating these different perspectives in our lived experiences. While this offers a promising avenue for further development of narrative theories, many questions remain unanswered, indicating the need for continued research and refinement in this area.


Derek Parfit's essay "The Unimportance of Identity" challenges the traditional notion of personal identity as a fixed, determinate concept. He argues that our common-sense belief in a continuous, unbroken self is an illusion and that questions about personal identity over time are often empty or merely verbal.

Parfit begins by distinguishing between two types of sameness: qualitative (or psychological) similarity and numerical (or personal) identity. While billiard balls can be qualitatively identical but numerically distinct, human beings pose a more complex issue due to our subjective experiences and sense of self.

He then introduces the problem of personal identity across time, focusing on questions like "Who am I?" and "Will I survive such-and-such an event?" Traditionally, philosophers have proposed various criteria for personal identity, including bodily continuity (the same body throughout one's life) and psychological continuity (a series of connected memories, experiences, and character traits).

Parfit rejects both views. He argues against bodily continuity by pointing out that our bodies continuously change at the cellular level, and against psychological continuity because it seems plausible that one could retain a sense of self while lacking such continuity (e.g., in cases of amnesia or brain damage). Instead, Parfit advocates for a reductionist view, which holds that personal identity simply consists in physical and/or psychological continuity.

Central to Parfit's argument is the idea that our belief in determinate personal identity arises from an intuition about the necessity of such continuity. However, he contends that this belief is mistaken when we consider "problem cases" – imaginary scenarios involving gradual or complete replacement of one's body and/or psychological traits.

Parfit presents two main arguments to support his reductionist view:

1. The absence of a sharp boundary or critical set of cells that would determine whether the resulting person is numerically identical to the original person. He claims that, in cases involving partial replacement of one's body (the "physical spectrum"), it is impossible to identify a clear threshold at which the resulting individual ceases to be the same person.

2. The emptiness of questions about personal identity in these problem cases. Parfit argues that, even if we cannot definitively answer whether the resulting person would be numerically identical to the original self, this does not imply that there are two possibilities or alternate realities. Instead, it shows that our question is merely about how to describe the single course of events given physical and psychological continuity.

Parfit concludes by suggesting that, once we know all relevant facts about physical and psychological continuity, questions about personal identity become empty or verbal – they concern linguistic descriptions rather than metaphysical realities. This, he argues, challenges our intuitions about the fixed nature of personal identity and supports a reductionist view that treats it as a matter of degree or continuity.

In essence, Parfit's argument questions the traditional concept of personal identity by demonstrating its lack of determinacy and suggesting that reductionist views better accommodate our experiences across time. He emphasizes that our sense of self is not an unchanging entity but rather a collection of physical and psychological traits that evolve over time, challenging the idea that there must always be a clear answer to questions about personal identity.


In this philosophical text, Derek Parfit argues against the importance of personal identity, focusing on two main points: reductionism about persons and reductionism about importance. 

1. Reductionism about Persons: Parfit asserts that personal identity does not consist of anything independently existing or having a special status. He claims that if personal identity just consists in certain other facts (like psychological continuity and connectedness), it cannot be an independent entity. Instead, it's merely a conceptual fact based on our language and understanding of what constitutes a person.

2. Reductionism about Importance: Parfit further argues that if a fact just consists in other facts (reductionism about importance), these lower-level facts can't be important in themselves. Only the reality matters, not how it's described or labeled with concepts. 

Parfit uses thought experiments and counterarguments to challenge common views on personal identity. For instance, he discusses the idea that what matters in our survival is that it will be 'our' future based on personal identity. Parfit disagrees, suggesting psychological continuity and connectedness are more significant.

He also presents an argument about brain damage leading to irreversible unconsciousness, questioning whether the continued beating of one's heart matters if it doesn't constitute conscious life. 

Furthermore, Parfit critiques arguments that use the concept of 'killing' as a moral absolute, suggesting this usage might not apply in cases where consciousness is absent despite bodily functions continuing.

Finally, he discusses the implications of compatibilist views on free will, questioning if the distinction between free and unfree choices has significant moral or rational importance. 

Throughout his arguments, Parfit aims to show that personal identity isn't as crucial as commonly believed, advocating for a focus on psychological continuity and connectedness instead. He argues against treating language or conceptual facts as more important than the underlying reality.


Title: "The Unimportance of Identity" by Derek Parfit

In this philosophical work, Derek Parfit explores the concept of personal identity, arguing that it is not as important as commonly thought. The essay begins by presenting several hypothetical scenarios to challenge our intuitions about what constitutes personal identity:

1. **Brain Transplant Scenarios**: In Case One, a person's brain is replaced gradually, cell-by-cell, with replicas. In Case Two, all cells are removed before being replaced. Parfit asserts that most people would consider the person in Case One to still be 'themselves,' while they wouldn't say the same for Case Two, even though both involve complete replacement of brain cells.

2. **Psychological Continuity**: Parfit posits that psychological continuity (sharing memories, traits, and experiences) is crucial for personal identity, not physical continuity. He suggests that if a replica of one's brain, including all psychological traits, were created, this replica would be 'you,' regardless of whether it replaced your original brain gradually or all at once.

3. **Brain Halves**: Parfit introduces the thought experiment of dividing one’s brain into two halves and transplanting them into separate bodies. He argues that if each half could support full psychological functioning, two people would result, both psychologically identical to the original. In this case, it's not clear which, if either, would be 'you.'

4. **Less than a Whole Brain**: Parfit contends that one could survive with less than their entire brain, as evidenced by individuals who've retained normal psychological functioning after losing half their brain to injury or stroke. 

Parfit concludes that what matters isn't strict identity but rather psychological continuity and certain other conditions (like having enough of one's original brain). He uses an analogy with a hypothetical community valuing twinship for psychological well-being, suggesting that just as they'd need to revise their views when children start being born as triplets, we should revise our views about identity over time.

Key Points:

- Personal Identity isn't crucial; what matters is psychological continuity and certain other conditions (like having enough of one's original brain).
- Gradual replacement vs. complete removal of brain cells before replacement doesn't significantly affect one's sense of self.
- Two halves of a brain transplanted into separate bodies would result in two psychologically identical individuals, neither of whom would be 'you.'
- We should focus on maintaining psychological continuity and necessary conditions for personal identity rather than strict identity itself.


In this chapter, Elisabeth Pacherie discusses the concept of self-agency, focusing on how it is generated and its content, mode, structure, and temporal aspects. She introduces two main approaches to understanding self-agency: high-level cognitive mechanisms and low-level sensorimotor cues.

1. High-level cognitive mechanisms: This perspective suggests that the sense of agency arises from a holistic, integrative process concerned with narrative self-understanding. It posits that our self-conception guides us to interpret our actions in a way that makes sense according to an implicit theory of ideal agency. Supporters of this view include Dennett and researchers interpreting split-brain studies through the lens of narrative self-interpretation. High-level cues might involve thoughts, beliefs, desires, and intentions that are consistent with actions and their outcomes.

2. Sensorimotor cues and low-level mechanisms: This alternative approach argues that the monitoring of action execution is crucial for agency, with the sense of agency being generated by lower-level mechanisms that exploit performance-related sensorimotor cues. Efferent signals sent to the motor system while implementing intentions are one possibility, as demonstrated by Tsakiris et al., who found self-recognition of bodily movements depended on these efferent signals.

Another low-level mechanism involves 'intentional binding,' where voluntary actions and their effects are perceived closer together in subjective time than they actually are, indicating predictive mechanisms for action control. Internal forward models used for action control, as proposed by Blakemore and Frith, also fall into this category. These models suggest that the sense of agency is constructed at the moment of action based on an immediate comparison between predicted and actual sensory feedback from the motor system.

Despite their differences, both approaches emphasize a principle of congruence between anticipated outcomes and actual outcomes. Recent research suggests that these models should be seen as complementary rather than rivaling each other, with the sense of agency relying on various cues from different sources.

Pacherie further explores the content, mode, structure, and temporal aspects of agentive self-awareness:

1. Content: Agentive contents can range from thin (merely knowing oneself as acting) to thick (including representations of action effects, reasons for performing actions, mental states causing actions, and more). The richness of agentive content is a topic of debate among theoreticians, with some arguing that only simple sensorimotor cues are involved while others propose richer contents.

2. Mode: Agentive self-awareness can take judgmental (e.g., beliefs) or experiential forms (e.g., immediate bodily sensations). There is a growing consensus that both agentive experiences and judgments are complementary, and the debate now focuses on their distribution and relationship.

3. Structure: States of agentive self-awareness should fit with reality; mismatches can lead to altered agency perceptions. Pacherie proposes a hierarchical model with distal cognitive intentions, proximal actional-perceptual intentions, and motor sensorimotor intentions providing different levels of cues for agency assessment.

4. Temporal aspects: Agentive self-awareness can vary depending on whether one is about to act, in the process of acting, or has completed an action. These dimensions interact with each other, and further research is needed to understand their relationships fully.

In conclusion, Elisabeth Pacherie presents a comprehensive overview of self-agency, discussing its generation through various cognitive and sensorimotor mechanisms, as well as exploring the content, mode, structure, and temporal aspects of agentive self-awareness. The chapter highlights ongoing debates in the field and suggests an integrated model that considers multiple levels of intentional processes contributing to our sense of agency.


This text discusses the nature of self-agency, which refers to our awareness and experience of ourselves as agents who initiate actions and control them. The author, Elisabeth Pacherie, delves into four proposed structures of states of agentive self-awareness: descriptive, directive, pushmi-pullyu (Millikan's representation), and lacking intentional content (raw phenomenal feels).

1. Descriptive Structure: This view posits that states of agentive self-awareness describe how things are, with a mind-to-world direction of fit and veridicality conditions. Agentive judgments, however, go beyond mere endorsements of experiences by providing interpretations based on one's self-conception.

2. Directive Structure: These states represent how the world should be changed and have a world-to-mind direction of causation. They include conditions of satisfaction but not veridicality conditions, suggesting they are about influencing future events rather than accurately reflecting reality.

3. Pushmi-Pullyu Representation: Proposed by Millikan, this account suggests that states of agentive self-awareness have both a mind-to-world and world-to-mind direction of fit. This allows them to be simultaneously descriptive and directive. However, this concept has not been extensively developed in literature.

4. Lacking Intentional Content (Raw Phenomenal Feels): This view posits that agentive self-awareness consists solely of raw sensations or feelings devoid of content or representation.

Pacherie argues that a single account may not suffice for all aspects of agentive self-awareness due to its complexity. She suggests that while agentive judgments generally have a descriptive structure, some aspects of agentive experience might exhibit directive or pushmi-pullyu characteristics.

The author also discusses the reliability of our sense of agency, which depends on the structure we attribute to these states:

1. If we believe in a descriptive structure, reliability becomes a matter of veracity—whether agentive experiences accurately reflect reality.
2. For a directive structure, reliability hinges on effectiveness—whether actions brought about by such self-attributions are successful.
3. If we consider raw phenomenal feels, the question of reliability doesn't apply since these feelings aren't about anything and don't have satisfaction conditions.

Pacherie then examines two claims made by Dan Wegner that our sense of agency might be illusory:

1. The Illusion of Free Agency: Wegner argues that the experience of acting freely is an illusion because metaphysically free will (uncaused actions) does not exist, as shown by Benjamin Libet's experiments demonstrating unconscious brain activity preceding conscious intentions to act. However, Pacherie suggests that our experience of freedom might be more modest—the lack of feeling compelled or controlled in one's actions, rather than requiring metaphysical free will.

2. Illusion of Conscious Mental Causation: Wegner contends that we erroneously believe our mental states (beliefs and desires) cause our actions, contradicting evidence from neuroscience showing the pervasiveness of automatic processes in human behavior. Pacherie counters by noting that while conscious mental causation might be overestimated, this doesn't necessarily mean we lack experiences of such causation. Instead, she proposes that our folk-psychological belief in conscious mental causation might be an interpretation of our agentive experiences rather than a direct endorsement of them.

In conclusion, Pacherie suggests that our self-image as agents, characterized by conscious mental causation and conscious experiences of agency, may need revising based on empirical findings. These findings indicate that automatic processes significantly influence human action, implying that the link between agency and consciousness of agency might be more nuanced than previously thought. She argues against a radical interpretation (agency as a mere illusion) in favor of a revised self-portrait that acknowledges both automatic and conscious contributions to agency while preserving the importance of conscious experiences in integrating these processes.


The chapter by Alfred Mele explores the concept of self-control, focusing on two main aspects: understanding self-control broadly as the capacity to resist temptation and act according to one's decisive judgment, and addressing concerns about the implications of causal theories of action for agenthood.

1. Self-Control and Scope: Mele begins by discussing various philosophical interpretations of self-control. He argues against Aristotle's view that self-control is rooted in reason, proposing instead a holistic understanding that encompasses the entire human being, including emotions and passions. Self-control, Mele suggests, can be exercised in any sphere (not just pleasures, pains, appetites, and aversions), and it extends to mental actions like accepting, rejecting, or modifying beliefs, values, preferences, or desires.

Mele introduces the idea of "decisive judgments," which are evaluations about what is best for the agent according to their values, principles, desires, and beliefs. Self-controlled individuals strive to act in accordance with these decisive judgments even when faced with strong competing motivations.

2. Akratic Actions: Mele argues that akratic actions – actions that conflict with an agent's decisive judgment – are possible and occur when the strength of a contrary motivation outweighs the motivation to act in accordance with one's decisive judgment. He presents two theses to explain how this can happen:

   - The first thesis is that, during practical reasoning, we often base our decisions on an evaluation of the objects of our desires rather than their motivational strength alone.
   - The second thesis posits that the motivational force of our desires doesn't always align with our evaluations of those desires' objects.

Mele suggests that, when these conditions are met, agents can end up acting against their decisive judgments due to stronger competing motivations. He maintains that self-control enables us to resist such temptation by influencing the strength and focus of our desires.

3. Self-Control and Vanishing Agents: Mele addresses concerns about causal theories of action potentially rendering agents irrelevant or indistinguishable from other natural phenomena. Philosophers like A.I. Melden, Thomas Nagel, and David Velleman argue that such causal accounts don't capture what distinguishes human actions as exercising agency.

Mele posits a significant role for self-control in overcoming this issue: by acknowledging our capacity to influence the strength of our desires through various means (e.g., focusing on desired outcomes, promising rewards, or imagining undesirable consequences), we can resist compulsion and maintain agency. In turn, self-control is a crucial component in understanding human action as exhibiting genuine agency.

In summary, Mele's chapter on self-control argues for a broad understanding of the concept that incorporates emotions and passions alongside reason, and he maintains that strict akratic actions (actions against decisive judgments) are possible due to misalignments between motivational strengths and evaluations of desired objects. Mele also defends self-control as essential for sustaining agency in the face of causal theories of action that might otherwise render agents indistinguishable from other natural phenomena.


The text discusses the concept of self-control in human action, focusing on Alfred Mele's perspective. Here are some key points summarized and explained:

1. **Velleman's Position on Motives**: According to Velleman (1992), when reflecting on motives, an agent aims to identify the stronger reasons for acting and ensure they prevail over weaker ones. When a weaker motive is deemed the best reason to act, the agent intervenes by reinforcing it with their desire to act in accordance with reasons (desire R). This, according to Velleman, forms the strongest combination of motives.

2. **Mele's Critique and Solution**: Mele argues that Velleman's formulation is awkward as it seems to artificially combine motives. He suggests an alternative solution based on a desire like R, which plays a crucial role in human agency. This desire, Mele claims, manifests as a standing desire to act for superior reasons. 

3. **Self-Control and Practical Concern**: Mele (1990) posits that self-control is characterized by practical concern - the care an individual has about how they conduct themselves. This concern is discriminating, meaning individuals prioritize what they deem most important. Thus, a self-controlled person cares how their life goes and is motivated to exercise self-control in support of their decisive judgments.

4. **Implementation Intentions**: Studies on 'implementation intentions' (Gollwitzzer 1999) show that forming specific plans for goal attainment (e.g., "I will perform a breast self-examination next month at 8 PM in my bedroom") significantly increases the likelihood of achieving goals compared to just setting general intentions. These findings suggest that self-control can be effectively enhanced through strategic planning.

5. **Addiction and Self-Control**: Despite common perceptions, addicts are not necessarily victims of irresistible desires. George Ainslie's work (1982, 1992) indicates that the strength of a desire increases as its fulfillment approaches, but humans can use 'pre-committing devices' or personal rules to resist impulses. Personal rules, such as explicit commitments about future behavior, can help manage temptations and strengthen self-control.

6. **Ego Depletion**: Roy Baumeister's 'energy model' of self-control suggests that willpower operates like a limited resource that can become depleted over time or with continuous use (Baumeister 2002). This idea, known as 'ego depletion', has been supported by empirical studies showing reduced self-control after exerting effort in tasks requiring self-regulation. However, strategies like implementation intentions and high stakes can mitigate ego depletion's effects (Baumeister et al. 1998; Webb and Sheeran 2003).

In essence, the text explores different philosophical perspectives on self-control in human action, incorporating empirical evidence from psychology to provide a nuanced understanding of this complex phenomenon.


In this chapter, David Shoemaker explores the nature of moral responsibility and its relation to personal identity. He begins by discussing the platitude that 'one can be morally responsible only for one's actions,' or The Platitude. This leads to the philosophical slogan that 'moral responsibility presupposes personal identity' (The Slogan), suggesting that an agent must be identical to themselves at different times in order to bear moral responsibility for their actions. 

Shoemaker investigates three main approaches to understanding this intimate relation: the Lockean, biological, and psychological criteria of identity, as well as a narrative approach.

1. The Lockean Approach: John Locke proposed that consciousness or memory ties actions together into a single personality over time. However, Shoemaker argues this view is insufficient because forgetting or lacking memory doesn't negate responsibility (drunk/hungover man case).

2. The Biological Approach: This criterion posits that biological continuity ensures personal identity. While it handles the drunk/hungover case, it fails to capture other instances like cerebrum transplants or fugue states where psychological discontinuity coexists with biological continuity.

3. The Psychological Approach: Here, unique psychological continuity—comprising intentions, beliefs, desires, and goals—is proposed as the basis for personal identity. This view accommodates the drunk/hungover case but struggles with fugue state variations and gradual psychological discontinuity cases (Johann's tumor scenario).

4. The Narrative Approach: Proposed by Marya Schechtman, this theory suggests that what makes various experiences and actions one’s own is their inclusion in a coherent life narrative or identity story. This approach handles fugue variations and drunken assault cases better than the psychological criterion. However, Shoemaker argues it's too subjective, as our identification with actions may occur passively rather than through active reflection or narration. Furthermore, omitting events from one’s story doesn't necessarily mean they're not morally responsible for those actions.

Shoemaker concludes that none of these theories fully captures the relationship between personal identity and moral responsibility. He suggests that future discussions should explore alternative theories or refine existing ones to better address this complex issue.


The text discusses the Real Self View (RSV) of moral responsibility, a theory proposed by Susan Wolf that suggests an agent is morally responsible for their actions if they are attributable to their real self. The real self is defined as the self governed by one's broadly construed valuational system. However, several objections challenge this view:

1. Responsibility for selves: This objection argues that there are cases where an agent may be held responsible for actions attributable to their real self, but we still consider them not morally responsible due to lack of responsibility for the self (e.g., insane individuals, those brainwashed, or from severely deprived childhoods).

2. Superficial responsibility: Critics argue that merely attributing an action to a real self is insufficient for moral responsibility; instead, we hold agents morally responsible by evaluating the moral quality of their character itself.

3. Negligence: The argument is made that one can be held morally responsible for actions where they haven't engaged in reflective evaluation (e.g., failing to salt front steps).

4. Whims: This objection presents cases where an agent's will operates independently from their valuational system, producing actions for which they are still deemed morally responsible, suggesting that governance by the real self is unnecessary for moral responsibility.

5. Inverse akrasia: When an agent fails to act in accordance with their evaluative judgment (e.g., Huck Finn not turning in Jim) but is still praised and deemed morally responsible, this challenges the RSV's necessity for moral responsibility.

These objections call into question whether governance by the real self is necessary or sufficient for moral responsibility under the RSV. The text suggests that these challenges can be addressed by refining our understanding of the 'real self' to include emotional commitments and nexus of cares, thereby accounting for passive identification due to factors like deception or indoctrination.

The author also highlights the need for normative competence – the capacity to determine actions based on moral demands from others – which is missing from the RSV. Incorporating this concept could provide a more comprehensive account of moral responsibility, ensuring that agents are not only self-determined but also capable of acting in accordance with societal expectations and moral norms.


The text discusses the concept of moral responsibility, focusing on the relationship between actions, identity, and the self. It explores different perspectives on how these elements interconnect to form our understanding of moral accountability.

1. **The Platitude**: The fundamental assertion that one is morally responsible only for their own actions is called "The Platitude." This idea is often misconstrued as implying personal identity, but the text argues against this interpretation. Instead, attributability (identification with an action or psychic element) is proposed as the key to understanding The Platitude.

2. **Identification and Attributability**: The notion of identification is central to understanding moral responsibility. One can be attributed an action if it stems from aspects of one's self, which might include unconscious elements or traits. Passive identification (unconscious alignment with certain traits) is proposed as a way to account for actions that are not explicitly endorsed but still reflect one's real self.

3. **Real Self View (RSV)**: This view posits that moral responsibility is grounded in facts about the self-expression of agents. It asserts that for an action to be morally attributable, it must flow from one's real self—constituted by evaluative commitments. The RSV acknowledges a distinction between two forms of responsibility:

   - **Responsibility as Attributability**: This form of responsibility is about whether actions are properly traceable to one's self, regardless of voluntary control or normative competence. It can be deep and meaningful even if the agent lacks accountability.
   - **Responsibility as Accountability**: This involves holding individuals answerable for their actions based on normative competence and moral reasons.

4. **Challenges to RSV**: The text discusses objections to the RSV, including the claim that attributability-responsibility is superficial and not genuinely moral without accountability-responsibility. Angela Smith argues that the RSV fails to distinguish between praise/dispraise (shallow responsibility) and full moral blame (deep responsibility).

5. **Responding to Critiques**: The text suggests ways to refine the RSV, such as incorporating attitudes alongside actions into moral responsibility assessments. This could allow for attributability-responsibility without necessitating voluntary control or normative competence. It also proposes distinguishing between reactive attitudes associated with each form of responsibility (accountability and attributability) to better capture the depth of moral responsibility.

6. **Psychopathy Case**: The discussion includes a consideration of psychopaths, individuals who may be morally responsible in certain respects but lack accountability due to their inability to grasp or respond to moral reasons. This case highlights the potential value in maintaining a distinction between attributability-responsibility and accountability-responsibility within the RSV framework.

In conclusion, the text explores various nuances of moral responsibility, questioning traditional notions of personal identity and emphasizing the importance of self-expression and identification for understanding our moral accountability. It proposes a refined version of the Real Self View that accommodates both action and attitude attributability while distinguishing between different forms of moral responsibility to better capture their depth and complexity.


The text discusses the concept of self-consciousness and its disorders, particularly focusing on schizophrenia. The authors, Josef Parnas and Louis Sass, present a phenomenological perspective on the nature of self-awareness and how it relates to schizophrenia.

1. **Self-consciousness**: This refers to experience being aware of itself or knowing itself. It implies that consciousness is inherently reflexive, meaning while perceiving a landscape, one is not only aware of the objects but also of the fact that they are seeing and existing as a subjective presence.

2. **First-person perspective**: This involves the elusive nature of self-awareness; a subject cannot simultaneously be given as its own object for examination. The sense of being a unified, persisting subject is intrinsically elusive due to this blind spot at the origin of subjectivity.

3. **Phenomenality**: This term refers to the "givenness" or appearance of things in consciousness. It's the medium through which appearances happen and is not just about object-like contents but also encompasses pre-reflective, non-thematic experiences. 

In schizophrenia, there are disorders affecting minimal self - the basic, implicit sense of self present in every moment of awareness. The authors propose that these disorders manifest as:

   a. **Hyperreflexivity**: An exaggerated self-consciousness where one directs focused attention towards processes or phenomena typically experienced as part of oneself.
   
   b. **Diminished self-affection**: A decrease in the passively felt sense of existing as a living, unified subject of awareness.

These disorders lead to instability in minimal self, which is normally smooth and automatic. This instability characterizes the schizophrenia spectrum, appearing in pre-psychotic stages (premorbid and prodromal) with symptoms like isolation, alienation, eccentricity, diminished energy, and mood lowering before a full psychosis develops.

The authors emphasize the importance of understanding these phenomenological aspects of minimal self to accurately interpret schizophrenia's psychopathology and validate phenomenological claims about the structure of self-consciousness. They also stress that clinical descriptions should account for the experiential continuum, co-occurring phenomena, and diminished self-presence often associated with thought insertion symptoms.


The text discusses the phenomenological exploration of self-disorders in schizophrenia, focusing on three primary axes: self-presence, perspective, and phenomenality. These aspects are not independent but interdependent elements of a single psychopathological Gestalt that influences symptomatic evolution.

1. Self-Presence: This refers to a disturbing feeling of being different from others due to an altered or diminished sense of self-awareness. Patients often report unstable fullness or reality of their self-awareness, feeling like they are losing contact with themselves, or even becoming nonexistent. These feelings can be associated with abnormalities in embodiment, such as experiencing the body as a mere object or feeling a separation between mind and body. The diminished sense of self-presence suggests an alteration or weakening of fundamental self-familiarity, which is essential for all other senses of identity.

2. Perspective: This aspect involves shifts in the location of one's perspective on the world or a spatial distortion in visual perception. Patients may describe a feeling that their point of view has moved or that objects appear skewed with strange spatial proportions, suggesting perspectival instability. In thinking, the usual sense of 'me-ness' is disrupted, leading to an experience where thoughts feel like external entities rather than being part of one's identity. This fissure in the stream of consciousness can result in Gedankenlautwerden, or hearing thoughts aloud.

3. Phenomenality: Schizophrenia is associated with paradoxical changes in manifestation processes. In normal experience, there's a constant interplay between theme and background, the distant and proximal, and pre-reflective and reflective aspects of experience. However, in schizophrenia, patients often experience an enduring, rigidly hyper-reflexive configuration of awareness trapping them in their interiority, making immersion in the world impossible. This hyper-reflexivity manifests as a heightened awareness of normally tacit inner processes and can also result in a diminished sense of phenomenality or consciousness.

The authors argue that these self-disorders represent the core feature of schizophrenia, which they term as 'trouble generateur.' This disorder of minimal self is central to understanding the diverse symptoms of schizophrenia and can potentially guide clinical practice and research by emphasizing patients' lived experiences. By acknowledging these disturbances in subjective experience, clinicians might rehumanize aspects of psychiatric care, improve diagnostic accuracy, and develop more effective interventions for early detection and treatment of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.


Case 2: Arthur at Work and Home 

In this case, Arthur displays a significant degree of self-fracture as his experiences, attitudes, and behaviors vary greatly between his work and home environments. Despite the pronounced differences in his presentation, however, he does not meet any of the three multiplicity criteria introduced earlier by Braude, Rovane, or Radden. 

At work, Arthur is characterized by intense focus, ambition, and subservience to his demanding boss. He is driven, competitive, and willing to make personal sacrifices for professional success. His agentic patterns revolve around achieving goals and maintaining a high status within the company. 

In stark contrast, at home, Arthur adopts an entirely different persona. Here, he is laid-back, easygoing, and affectionate with his family. He values relaxation, leisure, and spending quality time with loved ones. His home life agentic patterns prioritize comfort, connection, and personal fulfillment over career ambition. 

The disparity between Arthur's work and home selves is substantial, encompassing differences in personality traits, values, and behavioral tendencies. Nonetheless, there are no apparent epistemological barriers preventing him from recognizing or integrating these divergent aspects of his identity. 

Arthur's case illustrates how individuals can lead seemingly separate lives without meeting the criteria for multiple selves as per Braude, Rovane, and Radden. His ability to navigate between distinct roles and maintain coherence across contexts demonstrates a level of integration that falls short of the fragmentation required by these criteria. 

Moreover, Arthur's case raises questions about the normative implications of self-fracture. If extreme multiplicity is associated with pathology, as suggested by Braude's work, does this mean that individuals like Arthur, who experience significant role changes but remain psychologically integrated, are exempt from concerns regarding mental health? 

Ultimately, cases such as Arthur's challenge us to refine our understanding of multiplicity and its relationship to mental health. They also highlight the complexity inherent in human identity, reminding us that our selves are multifaceted and dynamic, capable of adapting to various contexts while maintaining a core sense of unity.


The text discusses the philosophical and ethical implications of the concept of multiple selves or multiplicity, particularly as it pertains to dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder. 

1. **Multiplicity in Philosophy and Psychiatry**: The text introduces three perspectives on multiplicity: Shaun Gallagher's, Jennifer Radden's, and Ewy Sheffer's. 

   - **Gallagher's Perspective**: This view is not explicitly detailed in the provided excerpt but seems to focus on the philosophical aspects of selfhood and consciousness.
   
   - **Radden's View**: Radden argues that multiplicity, even if it exists, should be considered pathological due to societal preferences for a unified self. She outlines conditions for multiplicity based on inter-psychic and interpersonal identification, personality differentiation, disordered memory, separate agendas, and shared executive functions.
   
   - **Sheffer's Perspective**: Ewy Sheffer focuses on the normative aspect of personhood. He posits that a unified self is an ideal to strive for, suggesting that multiple selves may exist if they can each act as rational agents with their own projects and goals.

2. **Clinical Cases of Multiplicity**: The text presents four case studies illustrating different facets of multiplicity:

   - **Arthur's Duality**: Arthur displays distinct personalities at work and home, but he experiences himself as a unified whole with no significant disorders in awareness or memory.
   
   - **Beth/Felicity**: Beth, an otherwise exemplary wife, has a separate alter-ego (Felicity) who handles her sexual needs due to early abuse trauma. This case raises questions about the nature of agency and identity across distinct subselves.
   
   - **Erika/Manfred**: Erika switches between masculine and feminine identities, each with their own memories and experiences. Despite this, she reports remembering Manfred's experiences as if they were her own, blurring the lines of distinct selfhood.
   
   - **Unidentified Case (likely John/Donnie)**: This case involves a man with two distinct identities, one of whom engages in harmful behavior. The complexity of this case challenges traditional notions of personal identity and responsibility.

3. **Normative Considerations for Self-Unity**: Both Radden and Sheffer's perspectives are normatively grounded, valuing unity or rational coherence in personal identity. 

   - **Radden's Argument**: Multiplicity is pathological because it deviates from societal norms of self-unity, which underpin concepts like moral responsibility and individual rights.
   
   - **Sheffer's Perspective**: A unified self is an ideal to achieve through multiple subselves, each with their own projects and goals. This view challenges the notion that multiplicity necessarily indicates pathology.

4. **Ethical Considerations in Treatment**: The text explores ethical dilemmas surrounding treatment of individuals with multiplicity:

   - **Consent**: Unanimous consent from all subselves may be necessary for any form of intervention, as imposing unification without it could infringe on autonomy and potentially cause harm.
   
   - **Suffering and Dysfunction**: Interventions should ideally address suffering endured by all subselves or social dysfunction caused by the multiplicity, rather than just intra-psychological distress. However, determining the extent of such suffering or dysfunction can be challenging.

5. **Conclusion**: The text concludes that while societal norms favor self-unity and view extreme multiplicity as pathological, this judgment is rooted in valued qualities like agency, trust, moral categories, and relationships. Treatment of multiplicity should ideally align with these normative preferences, requiring willing participation from all subselves and addressing societal dysfunction alongside intra-psychological distress.


Peter Hobson's chapter "Autism and the Self" discusses the nature of self-experience and relatedness in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here is a summary and explanation of key points:

1. Clinical descriptions of autism, such as those by Leo Kanner, illustrate that individuals with ASD have difficulties with self-awareness and interpersonal relationships. They often fail to respond to others calling their names, lack comprehension of first-person ("I") and second-person ("you") perspectives, and exhibit peculiar self-expressions in language (e.g., referring to themselves in the third person).

2. Non-verbal aspects of self/other awareness are also affected. Children with ASD may move among others like "strange beings," relate to objects rather than people, and display delayed interpersonal involvement, agency, and possession. They tend not to orient themselves towards other people's attitudes or emotions in social interactions.

3. Philosophical interpretations of autism by Bosch highlight the disorder's impact on interpersonal involvement, relational stances, agency, and possession. These characteristics are usually present in typically developing toddlers but relatively lacking in those with ASD.

4. Temple Grandin's first-hand account emphasizes her difficulty recognizing her own mannerisms without visual cues, suggesting a limited self-awareness based on internal reflection rather than social engagement.

5. Controlled studies on relational self/other awareness show that children with ASD have difficulties in person-to-person and person-person-world relationships:

   a. Parent reports reveal that young children with ASD are less likely to direct anger or distress towards people, engage in greetings, turn-taking, or show interest in others' feelings and attitudes (Wimpory et al., 2000).
   
   b. Experimental studies indicate that individuals with ASD have reduced interpersonal engagement during social interactions, such as smiling, nodding, and making eye contact (Hobson & Lee, 1998; Garcia-Perez et al., 2007). They struggle to adapt their behavior based on others' perspectives or shifting conversational stances.
   
   c. Children with ASD show reduced sensitivity to others' emotions in social referencing situations (Sigman et al., 1992), where they fail to engage with the adult's feelings and attitudes when hurt, scared, or pretending illness.

6. Despite challenges in other areas of social relatedness, children with ASD often exhibit a unique attachment relationship with their primary caregivers, although the nature of this attachment may differ from typical patterns due to atypical engagement and perspective-shifting.

7. Linguistically expressed self/other awareness is impaired in individuals with ASD:

   a. They struggle with using personal pronouns correctly and show difficulties in self-referential expressions, possibly stemming from poor recognition of others' attitudes (Bosch, 1970; Hobson, 1993).
   
   b. Imitation abilities are complex: they can copy goal-directed actions but struggle with adopting the style or perspective of others in imitating (Hobson & Lee, 1999; Meyer & Hobson, 2004). This suggests limitations in identifying with others and assuming their perspectives.
   
   c. Studies also reveal reduced emotional engagement, joint attention, communicative styles, and role-shifting abilities when individuals with ASD attempt to identify with another person (Hobson et al., 2007; Hobson & Meyer, 2005).

8. The chapter concludes by suggesting that understanding the self in autism requires considering dissociable components of self-development, interconnectedness and differentiation, developmental continuities between typical and atypical development, and the conditions for establishing a shared form of life to support interpersonal communication and language.


The passage discusses the nature of self-awareness and social understanding in individuals with autism, primarily focusing on the concept of 'identification' – the process by which one person takes on another's perspective or attitude. This account challenges the prevailing assumptions about children with autism, demonstrating that they exhibit a range of emotional experiences, though their manifestations may differ from those observed in typically developing individuals.

1. Parents and caregivers' observations: Hobson et al. (2006) interviewed parents of children with autism, revealing that these caregivers could recognize emotions like anger, fear, shyness, pride, and jealousy in their children. However, they seldom reported other-person-centered emotions such as guilt, shame, pity, empathic concern, or embarrassment. This observation aligns with self-reports from verbally fluent children and adolescents with autism, who also displayed difficulty in expressing emotions related to others' perspectives.

2. Limitations in social understanding: Children with autism may have a limited ability to understand other people's feelings as belonging to those individuals, thereby shaping their own emotional responses. This limitation is evident not only in their behavior but also in their self-reported experiences and descriptions of emotions.

3. Atypical expression of pride: Kasari et al. (1993) found that children with autism demonstrated a less social form of pride compared to typically developing peers, even though they might display typical reactions when succeeding at tasks or receiving praise. Their sense of pride seemed dissociated from other-person-centered attitudes and was more focused on accomplishment rather than recognition by others.

4. Impaired anticipatory concern: Hobson et al. (2009) found that children with autism showed minimal signs of concern when witnessing someone else experiencing emotional distress, despite typically developing peers displaying dismay and concern for the victim's feelings. This result suggests a deficit in the ability to anticipate and empathize with others' emotions.

5. Implications for self-concept development: The evidence indicates that children with autism have difficulty in experiencing and understanding other-person-centered attitudes, which affects their capacity to develop comprehensive concepts of self and others. This limitation stems from abnormalities in their propensity for identifying with the perspectives or attitudes of others – a crucial aspect of social interaction among typically developing children.

6. Role of identification in self-concept development: Identification, as outlined by Freud (1955/1921), allows young children to respond to and assimilate the perspectives or attitudes of others, ultimately shaping their understanding of possible modes of relating with others. This process is vital for developing an awareness of self-other relationships and grasping the notion that other people have distinct "selves" with mental states.

7. Consequences for language and social communication: The difficulty children with autism face in identifying with others' attitudes may contribute to their challenges in adapting pragmatic aspects of language, adopting multiple co-referential attitudes to objects or events, and forming close intimate relationships.

8. Potential neurological underpinnings: Functional MRI scans and other neuroimaging studies suggest that atypical mirror neuron function may play a role in the social difficulties experienced by individuals with autism (Minio-Paluello et al., 2009; Dapretto et al., 2006). However, it remains unclear whether this dysfunction is a cause or consequence of their impaired social understanding.

In summary, the passage argues that while children with autism do experience emotions and have self-concepts, they exhibit distinctive limitations in recognizing and engaging with other people's attitudes, emotions, and perspectives. These differences have significant consequences for their development of self-awareness, social understanding, and language abilities. The findings challenge common presumptions about children with autism by highlighting the complexity of their emotional lives and emphasizing the importance of identifying processes in shaping normal self-concept formation.


Marcia Cavell's chapter "Growth, Integrity, and Coming Apart" explores the philosophical and psychoanalytic perspectives on the self, focusing on the concepts of growth, integrity, and fragmentation. 

1. **Growth**: Cavell argues that the self grows and changes over time. She critiques René Descartes' notion of an unchanging 'I' behind appearances, suggesting instead that our understanding of ourselves is a process of reaching goals and expanding our self-concept. This growth is evident in various activities like art, learning an instrument, or engaging in dialogue, where inner subjectivity transforms into shared experiences. Cavell references Virginia Woolf's "To the Lighthouse" to illustrate this idea, contrasting the rigid, predetermined model of mind (like a piano keyboard) with the fluid, evolving process of creative work and self-discovery.

2. **Integrity**: Cavell posits that integrity is an aspect of growing and becoming a moral agent. It involves unifying one's values into a coherent whole, allowing for reliable action based on those values. She connects this to the psychoanalytic concept of ego development, which allows individuals to acknowledge others' separate realities while maintaining their own 'I.' Integrity emerges gradually as one learns to value and acts upon a set of unified principles, rather than being an instantaneous moment of self-discovery.

3. **Coming Apart**: Cavell discusses various mechanisms—self-deception, dissociation, and repression—that can fragment or weaken the integrity of the self. She argues that these phenomena aren't paradoxical; instead, they represent different ways our mental processes can disconnect from reality or from each other. These divisions undermine moral agency and self-knowledge, leading to a fractured sense of self.

In essence, Cavell's chapter suggests that the self is not a fixed entity but a dynamic process characterized by growth, integrity, and the potential for fragmentation. She draws on philosophy, psychoanalysis, and literature to develop these ideas, highlighting the complexity and evolving nature of our understanding of ourselves.


The text discusses the pragmatist view of the self as fallible, contrasting it with the Cartesian notion of a self that is infallible and certain of its own nature. The primary focus is on Charles Sanders Peirce's contributions to this perspective.

1. **The Fallible Self as Non-Cartesian**: Peirce challenged the Cartesian view, particularly in his 1868 papers published in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy (JSP). He rejected the idea that philosophical inquiries should begin with self-evident truths directly apprehended by reason. Instead, he proposed a fallible and self-correcting method based on scientific practices.

   - **Question 1: Intuitive Faculty for Discriminating Intuitions from Inferences**: Peirce defined intuition as cognition not determined by prior knowledge of the same object. He argued that there's no evidence for an intuitive faculty to distinguish between intuitions and inferences, undermining the Cartesian method which relies on such a distinction.

   - **Question 2: Intuitive Self-Consciousness**: Peirce questioned whether self-consciousness is intuitive or inferred. He proposed that self-awareness develops through interactions with the world and others, rather than being an innate faculty. Children learn about themselves through observing their bodies' reactions to the environment and understanding others' testimonies, suggesting a fallible process of developing self-consciousness.

2. **Fallibilism**: Peirce proposed a fallibilistic method for philosophical inquiry, contrasting it with the Cartesian deductive approach based on indubitable first principles. This method involves:

   - **Self-Corrective Practices**: Replacing self-warranting cognitions with self-corrective practices modeled after experimental science. Pragmatism embraces fallibility and continuous revision of beliefs based on evidence and reasoning.
   
   - **No Cognitive Immediacy or Intuitive Knowledge**: Peirce rejected the notion of immediate, infallible cognition. Instead, our understanding of ourselves and the world arises from reliable but fallible inferential processes, rather than an innate faculty of intuition.

In summary, Peirce's pragmatist view of the self is characterized by:

- Fallibility: The self is not infallible or certain of its own nature; it can err and be corrected.
- Inference: Knowledge of the self emerges from fallible inferential processes, rather than intuitive faculties.
- Interaction with the World and Others: Self-awareness develops through interactions with the environment and others' testimonies.
- Continuous Revision: The pragmatic method involves constant revision based on evidence and reasoning, rejecting fixed foundational principles.


The pragmatist conception of the self, as developed by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and George Herbert Mead, emphasizes a fallible, dynamic, and socially constructed self. This stands in contrast to the Cartesian notion of an infallible, static self with direct access to its own mind.

1. **Fallibilism**: Pragmatists reject the idea of infallibility in self-knowledge. Peirce, for instance, posits that beliefs and habits are formed through irritation from circumstances, and subsequent responses that alleviate this irritation. This process is fallible; the organism may misinterpret stimuli or make incorrect associations.

2. **Dynamic Self**: The self is not a static entity but a continuous process of development and adaptation. James' stream of consciousness, while personalized, underscores this dynamism. Dewey's moral agency concept further highlights the self as a growing, adaptable entity shaped by choices and habits.

3. **Social Constructivism**: Pragmatists argue that the self is fundamentally social. Peirce identifies the self with language, suggesting it arises through linguistic interaction within communities. Mead similarly posits that the self emerges from symbolic gestures and responses in a social context, particularly during childhood interactions with caregivers.

4. **Habit Formation**: Habits are central to pragmatist self-concepts. Dewey sees habits as 'working capacities' that can be flexible and open-ended, allowing for growth and change in the self. Mead's variation of this idea emphasizes how infants internalize social gestures through responsive communication with others.

5. **Moral Agency**: The pragmatist self is not merely an individual but a socially engaged entity. Dewey's ethical thought posits that the moral self is constituted by acts and habits, shaped by social membership, and directed towards growth rather than fixed ends or perfection. 

In essence, pragmatists view the self as an evolving, fallible entity inextricably linked with its environment, language, and social interactions. This is a significant departure from Cartesian introspectionism, offering a more nuanced, dynamic, and socially grounded understanding of selfhood.


Kenneth Gergen's chapter "The Social Construction of Self" discusses the development of social constructionist theory, focusing on the ungrounded nature of mental accounts and the implications for understanding the self. Here are the key points:

1. Gergen begins by defining his focus on the psychological or mental world within individuals, which is central to constructionist concerns. This includes assumptions about personal agency, rationality, and the role of these concepts in decision-making and personal growth.

2. He then outlines three major critiques that emerged from social movements and intellectual ferment in the late 1960s:
   a. Ideological Critique: Challenging taken-for-granted realities and their political consequences, often associated with Marxist scholarship, anti-psychiatry, feminism, racial studies, gay and lesbian studies, and anti-colonial movements.
   b. Literary/Rhetorical Critique: Highlighting the role of linguistic conventions in governing all claims to knowledge, drawing on semiotic theory and literary deconstruction (e.g., Derrida 1976).
   c. Scientific Revolutions Critique: Inspired by Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1970), which portrays normal science as guided by shared paradigms within communities, and research in sociology of knowledge and history of science (e.g., Feyerabend 1978; Latour and Woolgar 1986).

3. Gergen identifies three core ideas of social constructionist theory:
   a. Social Origins of Knowledge: What we consider knowledge of the world and self arises from human relationships rather than being inherent to individual minds. This challenges traditional views of reason, morality, and objectivity as residing within individuals.
   b. Centrality of Language: Conventions of language use determine accounts of reality; meaning is derived from relationships and language games, not from an objective reality.
   c. Politics of Knowledge: Research communities shape values and realities through their chosen methods, conventions, and metatheories. Accepting a paradigm has socio-political consequences for those outside the tradition.

4. Gergen discusses challenges to mental discourse and the psychological self:
   a. Self-Observation: The concept of internal observation is flawed, with problems such as consciousness turning in upon itself, obstruction by mental processes, lack of distinguishing criteria for mental states, and infinite regress in self-assessment.
   b. Observation by Others: External observation relies on reasoned inferences from neutral observers, but such observers are rarely entirely objective due to shared cultural assumptions.

Gergen's chapter sets the stage for exploring alternatives to traditional psychological conceptions of self, emphasizing the social and constructed nature of our understanding of ourselves.


The text discusses the social construction of self, a theoretical framework that challenges the traditional notion of an independent, autonomous self. It explores how our understanding of the self is deeply rooted in sociocultural contexts and language practices. Here are some key points:

1. **Critique of Introspection**: The text questions the validity of introspection or inner observation as a reliable source for psychological knowledge. This critique stems from the recognition that mental terms lack referents, making it impossible to determine their exact meanings across individuals.

2. **Historical and Cultural Variations**: Comparisons between Western and non-Western cultures reveal diverse conceptions of self. For instance, while Western culture emphasizes an individualized, autonomous self, many Eastern cultures view the self as interconnected with others in a communal framework.

3. **Self as Social Accomplishment**: This perspective posits that the self emerges from social processes, particularly discourse practices. Language structures like personal pronouns and narratives play significant roles in shaping our understanding of selfhood. 

4. **Narrative Construction**: According to this view, our life stories or narratives are central to our sense of self. They guide our actions and shape our moral integrity. The form of these narratives, shared within interpretive traditions, is seen as foundational to our understanding of the self.

5. **Ongoing Conversational Practices**: Discourse analysis highlights how ongoing conversations constantly refashion our sense of self. Interlocutors position each other's identities through their speech, and the 'conversational object' (self) is ontologically dependent on these interactions.

6. **Critical Reflections**: The text also examines how vocabularies of the self serve to rationalize and sustain cultural practices. Language, according to Foucault, becomes a medium for carrying out relations, constituting what we perceive as reality, and serving as a socially binding force.

7. **Dark Side of Individualism**: Critics argue that the Western emphasis on individual autonomy can lead to alienation, distrust, and a self-centered worldview. This perspective can also result in social control mechanisms like diagnostic categorization for mental illness, which may mystify underlying value agendas and promote pharmaceutical solutions over addressing societal issues.

8. **Relational Self**: In response to these critiques, there's a movement towards reconceptualizing the self as fundamentally relational rather than independent. This shift proposes that mental terms are not private states but public actions within relationships.

9. **Philosophical Foundations**: Philosophers like Wittgenstein support this perspective, arguing that language's meaning arises primarily from its use in human interaction. Thus, mental language could be understood as a form of relationship maintenance rather than a mirror of private inner states.

10. **Emotional Performances**: Even our emotional expressions are viewed as relational performances within culturally specific scenarios or 'plays'. They make sense only in their proper context and sequence, illustrating the deeply interpersonal nature of our self-understanding.

In essence, this text argues for a social constructionist view of the self, suggesting that our understanding of who we are is not an innate or inherent quality but rather a product of language, narratives, and social interactions. It challenges traditional psychological assumptions about inner experiences and proposes a more communal, relational model of selfhood.


The dialogical self is a theoretical framework that posits the self as an embodied, dynamic multiplicity of relatively autonomous 'I-positions' organized in an imagined landscape. This perspective is inspired by the work of William James, George Herbert Mead, and Mikhail Bakhtin. 

1. **James's Contributions**: James introduced the distinction between the 'I' (self-as-knower, subjective) and 'Me' (self-as-known, objective). The 'I' is volitional, exhibiting continuity, distinctness, and personal volition. The 'Me', on the other hand, consists of empirical elements that an individual feels as belonging to them—including not just physical attributes but also relationships, possessions, reputation, etc. This implies that people and things in the environment can be part of one's extended self. 

2. **Mead's Contributions**: Mead used the I-Me distinction differently than James, showing how selves represent society and conform to existing institutional structures but also have the capacity for innovation. He proposed that social rules and conventions become part of the 'Me', while the 'I' functions as a source of innovation. 

3. **Bakhtin's Contributions**: Bakhtin's metaphor of the polyphonic novel emphasizes that multiple authors or thinkers (characters) can coexist within one work, each with their own perspective. This idea extends to the dialogical self, where various positions within the self can have distinct viewpoints and engage in dialogue. 

The dialogical self is not a centralized entity but a dynamic multiplicity of 'I-positions' organized spatially and temporally. These positions are interconnected via mutual dialogical relationships and external dialogues with actual others. The self's voices represent different perspectives that exchange information, leading to the development of a complex, narratively structured identity. 

This framework acknowledges the existence of power differences in social interactions, which can result in some positions being dominant while others are silenced or suppressed. It also recognizes that not all positions need direct contact with one another; some may function independently without interference. 

The dialogical self is 'social' because other people occupy I-positions within the multi-voiced self, rather than existing externally. The imaginary aspects of these external positions can be explored through dialogue with actual others, potentially confirming, correcting, or modifying initial perspectives. 

This conception of the dialogical self challenges traditional notions of unity versus fragmentation. Instead, it proposes an inclusive opposition between unity and multiplicity, where both principles are complementary and dynamic aspects of a dialogical self. 

The spatial nature of the dialogical self becomes evident when considering logical vs. dialogical relationships. Two identical phrases ('life is good') can be uttered by two people in different positions, resulting in distinct meanings based on their spatial separation. Similarly, different voices within an individual's self (e.g., 'I as open' vs. 'I as closed') occupy unique spatial positions and contribute to the overall narrative structure of the self. 

Non-verbal communication plays a significant role in this framework, with body language, facial expressions, vocalizations, gestures, dance, music, etc., all serving as means for expressing dialogue within the self. 

In summary, the dialogical self is an embodied, multi-voiced construct that exists spatially and temporally, constantly engaging in a dynamic interplay of positioning, repositioning, counterpositioning, and dialogue with both imagined and actual others. This perspective highlights the social nature of the self, recognizing how external figures occupy internal positions and influence our perspectives and narratives.


The text discusses the concept of the dialogical self, emphasizing its development from early non-verbal interactions to more complex forms of intersubjectivity. It highlights the role of both hemispheres in this process, with the right hemisphere playing a crucial part in developing a dialogical self through non-verbal manifestations and social interactions.

The text also explores image schemas, which are mental structures derived from our bodily experiences. These schemas, such as verticality (more is up) and horizontality (progress is forward), serve as metaphorical foundations for our abstract understanding of the world. The use of these spatial metaphors is not arbitrary but has a basis in our embodied experiences, supported by recent research on embodied cognition.

Key moments in the development of the dialogical self include:

1. Imitation and provocation: Neonatal imitation, where infants mimic adult movements before they can visually perceive their own body parts, and neonatal provocation, where infants initiate actions to elicit a response from an adult, are precursors of dialogical activities like turn-taking.

2. Pseudo-dialogues: Early interactions between mother and child involve rhythmic exchanges where the mother responds to the infant's actions, treating them as 'turns' in a dialogue, even when the infant is not yet capable of verbal communication.

3. Joint attention: Around 9 months, children begin to perceive others as intentional beings and start viewing the environment from their perspective, a process that involves indirect self-knowledge.

4. Body positioning: The relationship between self and environment is tied to body positions. Moments like rolling over, crawling, standing, and walking allow children to explore different spatial perspectives, laying the groundwork for later metaphorical forms of self-positioning.

The text underscores the interconnectedness of social and bodily dimensions in the development of the dialogical self. It argues that sign-mediated interactions with others and oneself lead to the construction of personal and social meanings within a spatially structured, embodied self. Positions in this self are not abstract but emerge from social processes rooted in the body's form and movements.

The dialogical self is characterized by four key elements: addressivity (speaking with others as distinct subjects), difference (recognizing distinctions between positions within oneself), innovation (learning and development through dialogue), and alterity (acknowledging and respecting the other's unique perspective). The dialogical self stands apart from 'inner speech' or self-talk due to its multi-voiced, collective nature and its explicit rejection of dualism between self and other.

Finally, the text warns about 'rumination', a state where negative positions dominate one's self-concept, potentially leading to a loss of contact with the environment and an inability to integrate positive or alternative perspectives. Recognizing the alterity within oneself is challenging but essential for maintaining a balanced, dialogical self.


The text discusses the concept of the "dialogical self," a theoretical framework that emphasizes the interwoven nature of self and dialogue, transcending any dualism between individual and society. The dialogical self is positioned in space and time, with its spatial nature materialized by concepts like positioning and counterpositioning, and temporal aspects explored through processes of positioning and repositioning.

The author, Hermans, introduces the idea that alterity learning—the tolerance for uncertainty to recognize different positions within oneself and others—is crucial in fostering dialogical relationships. This tolerance allows for a balance between having a stable identity and accepting alterity. However, people often prefer familiar "comfort zones" due to their need for stability and safety, which may hinder the exploration of different perspectives.

Hermans also delves into the bodily foundation of the dialogical self, referencing studies in developmental psychology that suggest precursors such as imitation, provocation, joint attention, and significant turning points in body and movement development contribute to the formation of a dialogical self.

Four key factors central to a full-fledged dialogical self are discussed: addressivity (directedness), difference (acknowledging alterity), innovation (broadening one's comfort zone), and alterity learning (tolerating uncertainty). The phenomenon of "self-alterity" is introduced as an acknowledgment and evaluation of differences within the self, extending Levinas's view.

In a separate section, Elspeth Probyn shares her personal connection to anorexia research, discussing the emotional complexities involved in studying such sensitive subjects. She reflects on the ways subjectivity is problematized in research, emphasizing the role of emotions like anger and how they can drive critical tasks while potentially complicating objectivity in knowledge production.

Probyn's narrative includes her experiences as a researcher, including the emotional toll of revisiting painful memories associated with hospitals and anorexia treatment programs. She discusses the anger she felt upon encountering institutional frameworks that dehumanize anorexic individuals by treating them as objects of scrutiny rather than complex subjects.

Probyn's work also touches on the topic of emotions in research, arguing for a more nuanced understanding of how feelings—such as anger and rage—can inform and be generated by research processes. She highlights the need for researchers to acknowledge their emotional responses to research material and consider the impact this may have on their methods and findings.

Lastly, the text references Georges Devereux's ethno-psychiatry, emphasizing his ideas about the importance of acknowledging a researcher's anxieties, defensive maneuvers, and attribution of meaning to observations in producing genuine behavioral science data. Devereux's methods involve incorporating one's own emotional reactions as part of the research process, encouraging self-reflection and collegial accountability.

In summary, this text discusses the dialogical self theory, focusing on alterity learning, bodily foundation, and key factors for a full-fledged dialogical self. Elspeth Probyn shares personal experiences and reflections on researching anorexia, emphasizing the role of emotions in critical tasks and the importance of acknowledging one's emotional responses to sensitive research material. The text also introduces Georges Devereux's ethno-psychiatry methods, which highlight the significance of considering a researcher's emotional involvement in the production of authentic behavioral science data.


The text discusses the concept of the postmodern self, drawing on philosophers like Jean-François Lyotard, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, and Michel Foucault. The postmodern condition is characterized by an anti-Platonism that rejects transcendent domains of knowledge or reality. Instead, it embraces immanence, where discourses, selves, and beings are heterogeneous (differentiated) without a unifying meaning or identity.

1. **The Postmodern Self**: The postmodern self is heterogeneous due to its temporal nature. It's differentiated into past and future, lacking an identical origin or end. This leads to the realization that there's no constitutive identity of the self (or subject). Instead, individuals find differences within themselves: 'I is an other.'

2. **The Political Subject**: The core issue for postmodernism isn't individual identity but the political subject ('the people'). Given heterogeneity, the modern social bond, constituted by large narratives about history and universal freedom, becomes questionable.

3. **Problems of Postmodern Self**: There are two main problems in understanding a non-totalitarian postmodern self:
   - **Determination of Non-Totalitarian People**: How to conceive a 'we' that does not totalize or homogenize differences into unity and identity without violating singularities?
   - **Imagination of Non-Totalitarian Literature**: If the non-totalitarian people is absent, how can we imagine a literature that calls forth such a collective while respecting individual differences?

4. **Conditions of Impossibility**: The problems stem from recognizing heterogeneity's irreducibility and the impossibility of both totalization (universal people) and dispersion into groups. These conditions—anachronism and powerlessness—connect unity and diversity, event and repeatability.

5. **Phenomenology and Bergsonism**: The text traces postmodern thinking's roots to phenomenology (Husserl) and Bergsonism, focusing on their descriptions of time:
   - Husserl describes temporalization as present perception with retention phases (non-present repetition). This 'blindness' or 'hole' represents the past's persistence in memory.
   - Bergson views duration as a multiplicity and unity like no other, where moments interpenetrate, forming an inner flow of experience that includes both continuity (retention) and discontinuity (anticipation).

These philosophical movements reveal time's dual nature—event and repeatability—which heterogenizes all experiences. This tension between event and repetition forms the 'secret' of temporal experience, challenging the totalizing impulse in postmodern thought.


The provided text discusses the concept of the postmodern self within the context of Jacques Derrida's and Jean-François Lyotard's philosophies, focusing on the nature of time, narrative, and social bonds. The author argues that traditional notions of self and identity are problematic due to the irreducible necessary relation between repetition and singularity (the undeconstructable) as described by Derrida. This relationship implies that experience contains an inherent difference that cannot be fully captured or closed, leading to powerlessness and a sense of temporal disjunction (anachronism).

The text explores how phenomenology and Henri Bergson's theories of time, which make time absolute, necessitate two impossibilities: the origin and end. These impossibilities are reflected in narrative attempts to constitute social bonds. Lyotard identifies two complementary ways narratives can function: wild or primitive (legitimating origins) and cosmopolitan or modern (establishing universal identities).

The author then examines the experience of hearing oneself speak as a form of auto-affection, which is considered immediate but reveals temporal mediation upon closer inspection. This examination leads to two problems with the belief that interior monologue is entirely personal: the delay between speaking and hearing oneself, and the incorporation of other voices from the past within one's self-speech.

Lyotard argues that both primitive and modern narratives are totalitarian, as they create a singular identity that dominates a collective or humanity as a whole. This totalitarianism is evident in the way they attempt to eliminate heterogeneity and contingency. Lyotard extends this critique to show how Nazi myths of Aryan origin share this structure with primitive narratives, while modern narratives of universal freedom or enlightenment exhibit totalitarian tendencies through identity crises that result in the domination of a singular people's identity.

The author concludes by introducing two key problems for the postmodern self: (1) the question of whether a non-totalitarian social bond is possible, which does not bind collectively based on the aim of gaining more time and calculable possibilities, and (2) how to name friends of passage within this non-totalitarian framework. To address these problems, Lyotard suggests contemplating anachronism – the coexistence of repetition and singularity in experience – as a means to embrace uncontrollable potentialities rather than calculated outcomes. This leads to a sensitivity that appreciates heterogeneity and difference, transcending molar or majoritarian forms to recognize minor informalities.

In summary, this text delves into postmodern theories of self and identity by examining Derrida's notion of the undeconstructable and Lyotard's analysis of narratives in constituting social bonds. It emphasizes the impossibility of capturing experience entirely while acknowledging the inevitability of repetition and singularity, which lead to powerlessness. The author concludes by proposing a non-totalitarian approach to forming social bonds based on embracing anachronism and appreciating heterogeneity, rather than striving for totalizing narratives or calculated progress.


The text discusses the concept of self and subjectivity in philosophy, focusing on how feminist thought has critiqued traditional Western philosophical conceptions of a unified, autonomous self. This liberal 'self' is rooted in property-like notions, tied to rights and individual rational autonomy, and has been prevalent in Anglo-American philosophy. In contrast, the French tradition emphasizes reason or thought as the foundation of human being, embodied in a subject that resembles a grammatical function rather than a thing.

The author, Lorraine Code, argues for recognizing selves/subjects as always embodied and situated, with gendered, raced, and other multiplied identities playing crucial roles in understanding their existence within a complex world. She critiques theories that neglect subjectivity or view it as infinitely replicable, implying interchangeability. Code asserts that these oversimplified conceptions ignore the significance of situational specificity and positioning for human selfhood, epistemology, ethics, and political philosophy.

Code emphasizes Genevieve Lloyd's work "The Man of Reason" (1994), which traces the historical evolution of character ideals of reason from ancient Greece through Simone de Beauvoir, revealing how these have established regulative conceptions of self and subjectivity. This man of reason is a situated knower embedded in his social, material, and cultural context, shaping the inclusions and exclusions of rational thought and knowledge production.

Lloyd's investigation exposes how femininity has been constituted through processes of exclusion, with repudiations of the feminine playing a central role in defining what it means to be rational. This has resulted in an 'unthought' element within philosophical imaginaries that can now be unmasked.

Code also examines Nel Noddings' ethics of care and its implications for selfhood, contrasting it with the traditional ethics of justice centered on impartiality and detachment. Noddings argues that caring relationships are central to human flourishing, challenging the liberal notion of a detached, autonomous self.

In sum, Code's text critiques traditional Western philosophical conceptions of an autonomous self and advocates for recognizing selves/subjects as always situated, gendered, and socially embedded. This perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding of human existence, knowledge production, ethics, and politics. Code references key philosophers like Simone de Beauvoir, Genevieve Lloyd, Nel Noddings, and Annette Baier to illustrate this critique and propose alternative conceptions of self and subjectivity.


The text is a philosophical analysis of the concept of self, focusing on critiques of the liberal tradition's notion of autonomous subjectivity. The author, Lorraine Code, discusses several key points:

1. **Critique of Autonomous Subjectivity**: Code challenges the idea of an autonomous self as a fundamental human being, arguing that this conception is implausible and incomplete. She asserts that individuals are inherently social beings, shaped by societal influences from birth, which undermines the liberal tradition's emphasis on individualism and self-reliance.

2. **Influence of Liberal Tradition**: The author points out how this liberal model of autonomous subjectivity has pervaded various fields, including feminist thought. She examines the work of Carol Gilligan and Jean Baker Miller as examples, critiquing their focus on individual moral decision-making rather than acknowledging societal influences.

3. **Deconstruction of Self**: Code introduces Judith Butler's concept of 'the politics of the vulnerable body' to challenge the liberal tradition. This idea suggests that acknowledging human vulnerability—particularly women's experiences of sexual violence and the broader implications of autonomy-driven culture—can disrupt normative understandings of evil, war crimes, and human rights.

4. **Vulnerability as Central to Human Experience**: The text argues that acknowledging vulnerability is essential for a more comprehensive understanding of human beings. It asserts that the liberal tradition's obsession with autonomy has led to an erosion of our understanding of the complex, embodied nature of human existence.

5. **Risks and Challenges**: Code highlights potential risks in focusing on vulnerability: pathologizing women’s bodies and lives or generating further harm by exposing vulnerabilities. She suggests that addressing these issues requires careful navigation to avoid paternalism and sensationalism while effectively challenging oppressive structures.

6. **Precedents**: The discourse of care is presented as a distant analogy for navigating these challenges, drawing inspiration from its attempt to affirm women's experiences despite its shortcomings.

In essence, the text argues that the liberal tradition's idealized notion of autonomous subjectivity fails to account for the inherently social and vulnerable nature of human beings. It calls for a reevaluation of our understanding of self, incorporating vulnerability as central to human existence, while acknowledging and navigating the associated risks and challenges.


The provided text is an index of philosophical, psychological, and neuroscientific terms related to the concept of self, consciousness, and personal identity. Here's a detailed summary and explanation of key themes:

1. Self and Personal Identity: The index covers various aspects of self-concept, including minimal self (core self), narrative self-constitution, and sense of agency. It also explores philosophical debates on personal identity, such as numerical identity and the distinction between ipseity (selfhood) and idem (identity).

2. Philosophy of Mind: The index includes various philosophical positions like dualism (mind-body dualism), materialism, and idealism. It also covers influential figures in philosophy of mind, such as René Descartes, Immanuel Kant, Martin Heidegger, and Edmund Husserl.

3. Consciousness: The index touches on various aspects of consciousness, including introspection, phenomenology (as description and experience), first-person perspective, intentionality, intersubjectivity, and embodied cognition. It also covers topics like qualia (the subjective quality of experiences) and the hard problem of consciousness.

4. Neuroscience: The index references numerous neuroscientific concepts, such as brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, insula), neural processes (e.g., mirror neurons, default mode network), and cognitive functions (e.g., attention, memory). It also covers neuropsychological disorders that shed light on the neural underpinnings of self-concept and consciousness, such as Alzheimer's disease, aphasia, and out-of-body experiences.

5. Psychology: The index includes psychological theories and concepts related to self-concept, such as the self schema, body image, and the concept of self in developmental psychology. It also covers various psychological disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, autism) that provide insights into the nature of self and consciousness.

6. Feminist Theory: The index includes references to feminist theorists like Jean Baker Miller and their contributions to understanding the self in the context of gender, power dynamics, and social structures.

7. Cultural and Ethical Perspectives: The index covers cultural aspects of self-concept (e.g., Indian philosophy) and ethical implications of selfhood (e.g., moral responsibility, free will). It also includes references to critical theories (e.g., poststructuralism, feminist theory) that challenge traditional views on self and identity.

In summary, this index reflects a multidisciplinary approach to understanding the complex nature of self, consciousness, and personal identity. It encompasses philosophical debates, neuroscientific findings, psychological theories, and cultural perspectives to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic.


This index appears to be from a philosophical or psychological text that explores various concepts related to the self, consciousness, identity, and personal continuity. Here's a detailed explanation of some key terms and themes:

1. **Self (Selfhood)**: The concept of self is central to this index, appearing in multiple variations such as "self-as-object," "self-as-subject," "self-awareness," "self-knowledge," "self-recognition," "self-control," and "self-face." These variations reflect different perspectives on the nature of the self, including its subjective experience (first-person perspective), its objective reality (third-person perspective), and its interplay with consciousness, identity, and personal continuity.

2. **Personal Identity**: This term is closely related to the concept of self, often referring to questions about what makes a person who they are over time. The index mentions "puzzle cases of personal identity," which likely refers to thought experiments or hypothetical scenarios designed to challenge our intuitions about personal identity, such as teletransportation (a form of travel that involves disassembling and reassembling matter) or brain transplants.

3. **Consciousness**: Consciousness is another central theme, appearing in terms like "stream of consciousness" (or thought), "subjectivity," "self-awareness," "proprioception" (the sense of the relative position of neighboring parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement), and "qualia" (individual instances of subjective, conscious experience).

4. **Philosophical Perspectives**: The index references several philosophical schools of thought:
   - **Physicalism/Materialism**: This perspective asserts that everything, including the mind, can be reduced to physical processes and entities. Terms like "physical continuity" and "physicalism" reflect this view.
   - **Platonism**: This is an approach that posits the existence of abstract, non-material forms or ideas, often associated with the work of Plato. The index mentions Plato in several entries, possibly connecting his philosophy to discussions of the self, consciousness, or ideal forms.
   - **Postmodernism/Poststructuralism**: These movements challenge grand narratives and meta-narratives, emphasizing the role of language, power relations, and social constructs in shaping our understanding of reality, including the self.

5. **Psychological Continuity vs. Physical Continuity**: The index often contrasts "psychological continuity" (continuity of mental states, memories, and consciousness) with "physical continuity" (continuity of the body and brain). These distinctions are crucial in debates about personal identity, particularly in discussions about what it means for a person to survive bodily changes or transplants.

6. **Psychopathology**: This term refers to mental disorders or diseases. The index mentions psychopathy and schizophrenia, indicating that the text may explore how philosophical discussions of selfhood intersect with clinical psychology and neuroscience.

7. **Intersubjectivity**: This concept refers to our shared understanding and experiences with others, emphasizing the social dimension of selfhood. The index mentions "social cognition" and "social identity," reflecting this focus on interpersonal relationships.

8. **Thought Experiments (or Thought-Experiments)**: These are hypothetical scenarios used to explore philosophical concepts, often involving counterintuitive or extreme situations. The index lists several thought experiments related to personal identity and the self.

9. **Neuroscience and Cognitive Science**: Several neuroscientific terms appear in the index (e.g., "proprioception," "rubber hand illusion," "brain transplants"), suggesting that the text engages with findings from these fields, possibly to inform or challenge philosophical views on selfhood.

In summary, this index reveals a rich and complex exploration of the self, consciousness, identity, and personal continuity through various philosophical lenses, psychological perspectives, and neuroscientific concepts. It highlights debates about the nature of the self (e.g., whether it's physical or immaterial), the conditions for personal identity over time, and the role of intersubjectivity in shaping our understanding of selfhood.


### gall10overextended

In "The Overextended Mind," Shaun Gallagher expands upon the Extended Mind Hypothesis proposed by Andy Clark and Alva Noë (and further developed by Clark) to argue for a broader understanding of what constitutes cognitive processes. This extension goes beyond individual minds and biological brains to include social, cultural, and institutional factors.

Gallagher begins by discussing the Parity Principle introduced by Clark and Chalmers, which suggests that if a process in the world would be recognized as cognitive if it occurred within the head, then that part of the world is also part of the cognitive process. However, Gallagher argues against interpreting this principle strictly, as it could limit cognition to processes similar to those in the head, thereby missing out on the richness and diversity of human cognitive life.

To address this concern, Clark proposed three criteria for a process to be considered part of an individual's cognitive system: (1) reliably available and typically invoked, (2) automatically endorsed without critical scrutiny, and (3) easily accessible when needed. Gallagher explores how these criteria might apply to social institutions such as the legal system.

Using the legal system as an example, Gallagher explains that cognitive processes like judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making can be extended beyond individual brains into institutional structures. The legal system, for instance, provides a framework of rules, precedents, and standardized practices that enable individuals to engage in complex cognitive tasks (like rendering legal judgments) more effectively than they could on their own.

To support his argument, Gallagher introduces the concept of "mental institutions," which are social institutions that help us accomplish certain cognitive processes. These include systems like law, education, culture, and even science. Such institutions create enabling conditions and, in some cases, constitutive conditions for specific classes of cognitive processes.

Gallagher then discusses how these mental institutions function as cognitive aids by offering external memory, rules, and procedures that support our thinking. The legal system, for example, enables lawyers and judges to handle complex cases by providing established norms, precedents, and procedural guidelines, which in turn shape the way individuals process information and make decisions within that domain.

Addressing potential criticisms, Gallagher argues against the notion that external processes play only a contextual or enabling role rather than a constitutive one in cognition. He suggests redefining the mind as an enactively generated engagement with the world through which we solve problems, control behavior, understand, judge, and explain things.

Gallagher's overextended conception of the mind recognizes that our cognitive processes are not confined to individual brains but are also shaped by social and cultural institutions in ways that extend and transform our abilities. This perspective challenges traditional views of cognition as solely residing within the head, embracing a broader understanding that includes both internal brain processes and external social and cultural practices.

In conclusion, Gallagher asserts that extending the mind to include mental institutions allows us to appreciate the full range of human cognitive capabilities, highlighting how we can engage in complex problem-solving, judgment, and decision-making with the help of these external resources. This overextended view of the mind also encourages critical reflection on the ways social and cultural practices shape our cognitive processes and possibilities.


The text discusses the concept of cognitive extension or the "extended mind," a theory introduced by Andy Clark and David Chalmers. This idea challenges traditional notions of cognition being confined within the brain, suggesting that tools like notebooks, computers, and other external devices can be integral to our cognitive processes.

1. **Cognitive Extension**: According to this theory, when we use tools or parts of our environment to support our thinking, mental processes extend beyond the boundaries of our individual minds. These external aids become part of our cognitive system. For example, using a computer mouse can alter how we perceive and interact with our physical space (Bassolino et al., 2009).

2. **Mental Institutions**: The idea is further elaborated in Gallagher and Crisafi's work on 'mental institutions'. They propose that socially-shared practices, like language or scientific methods, also contribute to extending our cognitive abilities (Gallagher & Crisafi, 2009).

3. **Implications for Cognition**: This perspective has implications for understanding various phenomena. For instance, the spatial navigation skills of taxi drivers have been found to induce structural changes in their hippocampi (Maguire et al., 2000), suggesting a tight integration between cognitive processes and brain structures. 

4. **Philosophical Perspectives**: Philosophers like Clark, Crane, and Menary have contributed to this discourse. Clark argues that consciousness is not purely confined within the head but spreads into the world through our interactions with it (Clark, 2009). Crane posits that intentionality—the directedness of mind toward content—is a hallmark of mental states and can extend to external objects (Crane, 1998). Menary emphasizes cognitive integration and continuity across different levels of analysis (Menary, 2009).

5. **Critiques and Developments**: While the extended mind hypothesis has been influential, it also faces criticisms. Some argue that it blurs the distinction between thinking and using tools. Others question whether non-biological entities can genuinely be part of our cognitive system. Despite these debates, the concept continues to inspire research at the intersection of cognitive science, philosophy, and anthropology (Rolands, 2009; Rupert, 2009).

6. **Materiality of Cognition**: Related ideas explore how material artifacts or environments can constitute cognitive processes. This is evident in work like Murray Wheeler's exploration of the 'cognitive life of things' (Wheeler, in press), suggesting that our understanding of mind and cognition should extend to include non-human entities and practices.

Overall, the extended mind theory encourages us to view cognitive processes as distributed across both biological brains and external resources, reshaping our understanding of what constitutes thinking, learning, and remembering.

Title: Recent Phenomenology in Cognitive Science

Author: Shaun Gallagher, Department of Philosophy, Canisius College, Buffalo, NY 14208, USA. Email: gallaghr@canisius.edu

Abstract: This review examines the intersection of phenomenology and cognitive science, focusing on their relationship, commonalities, and differences in explaining consciousness. The author explores key issues such as expressing subjective experiences objectively, using principles of isomorphism to understand brain-consciousness interrelations, and the division of labor between phenomenology and cognitive science.

Key Points:

1. Uneasy Détente:
   - Marbach (1993) identifies a lack of relationship or even antagonism between phenomenology and cognitive science.
   - Both fields study consciousness but from different levels – phenomenology on intentional/introspective, while cognitive science focuses on non-conscious processes.

2. Phenomenology's Contribution to Cognitive Science:
   - Marbach argues that cognitive science is incomplete without a controlled and reliable description of consciousness.
   - He suggests phenomenology provides essential conceptual categories for understanding mental phenomena, thereby constraining cognitive scientific explanations.

3. Dennett's Critique:
   - Daniel Dennett (1991) challenges the validity of using subjective reports in a scientific context due to problems with word meaning and immunity to error during introspection.
   - He proposes heterophenomenology, which involves interpreting subjects' statements about their experiences as neutral data without assuming veracity.

4. Problem of Word Meaning:
   - Both Dennett's heterophenomenology and Marbach's phenomenological notation face challenges regarding intersubjective agreement on meaning.
   - Heterophenomenology may diminish the means for clarifying meaning, while Marbach's formalized notation requires an initial justification for its meanings.

5. Isomorphism and Anthropomorphizing Subpersonal Levels:
   - Cognitive science sometimes intentionalizes subintentional levels (anthropomorphism) or applies the 'intentional stance' to subpersonal processes, leading to fallacies like misplaced intentionality.
   - Van Gelder and Dreyfus propose that phenomenology can guide cognitive scientists in developing dynamical models of consciousness rather than computational ones.

6. Isomorphic Correspondence:
   - Dreyfus and van Gelder argue for isomorphism between intentional processes and subpersonal mechanisms (neural networks).
   - This raises questions about whether subpersonal processes must be isomorphic to intentional processes and how this correspondence can guarantee explanation.

7. Challenges to Isomorphism:
   - Neurophysiological research challenges the assumption that temporal structures of subpersonal representation are identical to those on the phenomenal level.
   - The brain's distributed processing contradicts the ordered, coherent nature of intentionality.

In conclusion, the review suggests that while there is potential for phenomenology and cognitive science to inform each other, several challenges must be addressed regarding communication, word meaning, and the nature of causal explanations in consciousness studies. The relationship between these two approaches remains complex, with ongoing debates about their respective roles and methods.


The provided text discusses the relationship between phenomenology, a branch of philosophy focusing on conscious experience, and cognitive science, an interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding the nature of cognition. The author, Shaun Gallagher, explores how phenomenological approaches can inform cognitive science, particularly in addressing the "hard problem" of consciousness—explaining why and how we have subjective experiences.

1. **Isomorphic Correspondence**: The text critiques the notion that isomorphic correspondence (similarity or similarity-in-law) between intentional and subpersonal levels constitutes a good explanation for conscious experience. Using the analogy of an automobile, Gallagher argues that the smooth behavior of the vehicle does not necessarily reveal the explosive processes driving it. Similarly, he suggests that neural net processes being isomorphic to intentional processes doesn't automatically explain them.

2. **Varela's Neurophenomenology**: Francisco Varela proposed neurophenomenology as an alternative approach, aiming to establish strict correlates between phenomenological and neuroscientific accounts rather than relying on isomorphic correspondence. Varela sought experimental data from neurosciences to tie phenomenology to dynamical processes, thereby creating a causal explanation.

3. **Phenomenology as Constraint**: Gallagher discusses the distinction between strong (isomorphic) and weak versions of phenomenology's constraint on cognitive science:
   - Strong version: Phenomenological descriptions of consciousness provide a template for subpersonal explanations, requiring isomorphism.
   - Weak version: Precise description of intentional experiences guides the search for good subpersonal explanations without assuming strict mirroring.

4. **Proclivity to Theory**: Gallagher warns about reflective phenomenology's susceptibility to reading too much into conscious processes or slipping into theoretical construction, as exemplified by Husserl's retentional and protentional structures in time-consciousness analysis. These constructs may be theoretically elegant but lack direct phenomenological evidence of existence in consciousness.

5. **First- vs Third-Person Perspectives**: Gallagher discusses the interdependence between first-person (phenomenological) and third-person (objective, scientific) perspectives:
   - Science is conducted by finite, conscious persons within a phenomenological framework influenced by the world.
   - Descartes' failure to achieve a presuppositionless perspective highlights that there's no purely detached first-person viewpoint.

6. **Internalism vs Externalism**: The text critiques cognitive science's internalist tendencies, which discount or relegate intentional aspects of human behavior, focusing solely on brain processes for explanation. Existential phenomenology (e.g., Heidegger) challenges this view by arguing that consciousness cannot be fully understood without considering the embedded, social world in which it functions.

7. **McClamrock's Externalist Analysis**: Ron McClamrock's work offers an externalist perspective, emphasizing the importance of context-dependence and ecological embeddedness for understanding cognition. He argues that subpersonal processes' intentional content emerges from their interactions with a structured world, including social and physical environments.

In summary, Shaun Gallagher's text explores the complex relationship between phenomenology and cognitive science, emphasizing the need to avoid fallacies like substituting isomorphic correspondence for explanation or misinterpreting phenomenological descriptions as templates for subpersonal explanations. He also critiques internalist tendencies in cognitive science, advocating for an externalist approach that recognizes consciousness's embeddedness in a structured world encompassing social and physical contexts.

The chapter "One: Cognitive Science and Human Experience" from Evan Thompson's book "Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind" discusses the origins and limitations of cognitive science as it pertains to understanding human experience.

Cognitive science emerged in the 1950s as a response to behaviorism in psychology, adopting the computer model of mind. This model posits that mental processes involve information processing similar to digital computers. Mental representations are seen as symbols manipulated in a formal or syntactic manner within the brain, following algorithms to solve problems.

The cognitivist approach focuses on abstract problem-solving characterizations of tasks and the structure and content of symbolic representations. This perspective aligns with functionalism in philosophy, which asserts that mentality is fundamentally software rather than hardware (embodiment). The cognitivist view divides the mind into two regions: subjective experiences (personal awareness) and subpersonal cognitive routines (nonconscious processes).

This separation between cognition and consciousness has led to a significant problem in scientific accounts of the mind – the "explanatory gap." The cognitivist model, while making meaning scientifically acceptable through representational semantics, excluded subjective experience from its purview. Consequently, cognitive science initially failed to address mentality as subjective experience or consciousness.

Thompson highlights that this exclusionary approach inherited a dualistic view from behaviorism. He also contrasts the cognitivist model with Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory, which acknowledged unconscious mental processes while preserving a connection to conscious experience.

The cognitivist separation resulted in three primary problems:
1. The phenomenological mind-body problem: How can a brain have experiences?
2. The computational mind-body problem: How can a brain accomplish reasoning?
3. The mind-mind problem: What is the relation between computational states and experience?

These issues represent different facets of the "hard problem of consciousness," which questions how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experiences. Thompson argues that cognitivism's computer metaphor, intended to solve the computational mind-body problem, paradoxically introduced a new mind-mind problem by radically separating subpersonal cognitive processes from conscious experience.

Moreover, the chapter critiques the cognitivist view for misconstruing human computation as an individualistic process. Thompson posits that actual human computation is sociocultural and embedded in environments. The real-world analogs of formal computations are vastly more complex than abstract notions like Turing Machines, involving physical interactions with the environment and other individuals through perception and motor action.

In summary, Thompson's chapter critiques cognitive science for initially neglecting subjective experience and consciousness in its quest to understand mental processes. The computer model of mind, central to cognitivism, has been problematic because it divorces subpersonal cognitive routines from subjective experiences, creating several explanatory gaps that remain unresolved in contemporary scientific accounts of the mind.


The text discusses three main approaches in cognitive science that challenge traditional computational models of the mind: Connectionism, Embodied Dynamicism, and the Enactive Approach.

1. **Connectionism**: This approach emerged in the 1980s as a revival of cybernetics ideas, focusing on neural networks as its central metaphor for understanding cognition. Connectionist models are composed of layers of simple neuron-like units linked by numerically weighted connections. The strength of these connections changes according to learning rules and the system's history of activity. These networks can perform cognitive tasks like speech production or word categorization, with their performance corresponding to emergent patterns of activity. Connectionism emphasizes perceptual pattern recognition over deductive reasoning, unlike Cognitivism.

2. **Embodied Dynamicism**: This approach arose in the 1990s as a critical stance against computationalism (both cognitivist and connectionist forms). It questions the disembodied and abstract nature of cognitive processes proposed by these models. Embodied dynamicism posits that cognitive processes are not just instantiated in the brain but also deeply rooted in continuous sensorimotor interactions involving the body, environment, and nonlinear dynamics. It views cognition as an emergent property of such interactions and treats mind and world as intertwined, not separate entities.

3. **The Enactive Approach**: Introduced by Varela, Thompson, and Rosch in their book "The Embodied Mind," this approach unifies several related ideas. It emphasizes that living beings are autonomous agents that generate and maintain their own cognitive domains through action. The nervous system is viewed as an autonomous dynamic system creating coherent patterns of activity. Cognition is seen as the exercise of skillful know-how in situated and embodied action, with cognitive structures and processes emerging from recurrent sensorimotor patterns. Enactive approach highlights the importance of experience in understanding the mind and advocates for a complementary relationship between mind science and phenomenological investigations of human experience.

The text also delves into Phenomenology, a philosophical tradition anchored to careful description, analysis, and interpretation of lived experience. It introduces key concepts like the Phenomenological Reduction (a method to investigate the structure of experience) and Intentionality (consciousness's ability to constitute or bring objects to awareness). Additionally, it discusses three phases of phenomenology: Static (analyzing formal structures of consciousness), Genetic (examining how intentional structures emerge over time), and Generative (focusing on the life-world—the cultural, historical, and intersubjective constitution of our human world).

Lastly, it mentions the importance of the Phenomenological Attitude, which involves stepping back from the natural attitude's unreflective positing of the world to critically investigate experiences sustaining this attitude. The Epoché—suspension or neutralization of judgments and theoretical beliefs about objective reality—is a crucial method in the Phenomenological Reduction, enabling an open and non-dogmatic exploration of experience's correlational structure with subjectivity.


The text discusses the evolution of phenomenological thought from its empirical and psychological roots to a more transcendental philosophical approach. This shift is characterized by a focus on how objects are experienced and known, and the a priori conditions for such experience and knowledge. 

The transcendental phenomenology, inspired by Kant's method, examines not what things are but rather how they are given in meaning to us. It investigates the essential formal laws that underlie our experience of a meaningful world. This approach posits that reality is disclosed through an active engagement of consciousness, as opposed to being passively encountered.

Key aspects of transcendental phenomenology include:

1. Focus on phenomena (appearances) and their meanings: It investigates how meaningful phenomena are constituted or brought to awareness by our conscious acts.
2. Uncovering the essential formal laws: Transcendental phenomenology seeks to reveal the necessary conditions for experience, which play a crucial role in shaping our understanding of reality.

While Husserl's focus was initially on egological consciousness (the reflective "I" or "ego"), his thought expanded over time to encompass nonegological structures like the lived body, time-consciousness, and intersubjectivity. This broader perspective of transcendental phenomenology extends beyond individual consciousness into the depths of our bodily existence and sociocultural worlds.

The text also delves into the phenomenological doctrine of intentionality:

1. Consciousness is inherently intentional, aiming toward or intending something beyond itself. This should not be confused with having a purpose when acting.
2. Types of intentionality include object-directedness (experiencing something more or less determinately) and openness to the world (alterity).
3. Mental acts are described as intentional experiences that involve an act of perceiving, remembering, imagining, etc., with cognitive and affective life constituted by communal norms, conventions, and historical traditions.
4. The correlational structure of intentionality highlights the inseparable relationship between mental acts (noesis) and their intended objects (noema).

Phenomenology conceives of mental representation as a process where acts have directedness rather than states having content. It distinguishes between presentational and re-representational intentional acts: the former involves perception, where the object is given as present in its very being; the latter entails memory or imagination, where the object is absent but mentally evoked.

The text concludes by connecting phenomenology with the enactive approach and dynamic systems theory, highlighting their shared emphasis on intentionality and self-organization. The enactive perspective posits that meaning emerges through continuous reciprocal interaction between an autonomous system and its environment. This notion of transcendence within immanence resonates with Husserl's understanding of the phenomenological constitution of reality, where external events are given significance by a system's own activity.

The shift from static to genetic phenomenology deepens this connection:

1. Static phenomenology analyzes invariant formal structures and constitutive processes in experience.
2. Genetic phenomenology investigates the genesis and development of these structures, focusing on experiences like time-consciousness and affect.
3. In genetic phenomenology, the conscious subject is not merely an ego-pole but a concrete living bodily subject with habits, interests, and capabilities shaped by accumulated experience.
4. Active genesis involves deliberate productivity in constituting objects (tools, artworks, etc.), while passive genesis entails the involuntary formation of habits, motor patterns, associations, and dispositions through sensory experiences affecting our living body.


The text discusses two key concepts central to the Enactive Approach: Autonomous Systems and Emergence, with a focus on Dynamic Co-Emergence.

1. Autonomous Systems:
   - An autonomous system is self-determining, distinguished from systems determined externally (heteronomous). 
   - It behaves as a coherent unity in its interactions with the environment without requiring external control or programming. 
   - Examples include living cells, multicellular organisms, ant colonies, and humans. 
   - Automatic bank machines, on the other hand, are heteronomous systems, controlled from outside by human design and following an input/processing/output paradigm. 
   - In contrast to this, interaction with autonomous systems is viewed as a conversation, where unsatisfactory outcomes are perceived as breaches of understanding rather than errors.
   - The Enactive Approach emphasizes the importance of understanding living beings and cognitive agents as autonomous systems.

2. Emergence:
   - Emergence describes the arising of large-scale, collective patterns of behavior in complex systems, such as cells, brains, ecosystems, cities, and economies. 
   - It is closely related to self-organization and circular causality, involving reciprocal influences between "bottom-up" (individual components) and "top-down" (emergent patterns) processes.
   - The text introduces the concept of Dynamic Co-Emergence: 
     - This perspective posits that a whole (the emergent pattern) not only arises from its parts, but the parts also arise from the whole.
     - Part and whole co-specify each other dynamically; neither can be reduced to the other without losing essential aspects of their nature.
     - The whole cannot be characterized independently of the parts, nor can the parts be understood independently of the whole.

The Enactive Approach employs these concepts to argue for a view of human mind emergence from self-organizing processes tightly interconnecting brain, body, and environment at multiple levels. This approach contrasts with classical cognitive science, which often assumes an abstract, disembodied, and cultureless model of the mind as a physical symbol system or connectionist neural network in a solitary individual's head. The Enactive Approach aims to address the explanatory gap by exploring the roots of mind in life and working forward to subjectivity and consciousness.


The passage discusses the concept of autonomy and its implications for understanding biological systems, cognition, and information processing. It introduces two approaches to autonomy: top-down (organizational and operational closure) and bottom-up (energetic and thermodynamic requirements). The latter focuses on basic autonomy as the capacity to manage matter and energy flows while regulating internal processes and environmental interactions.

Key components of basic autonomy, according to Ruiz-Mirazo and Moreno (2004), include a semipermeable active boundary or membrane, an energy transduction/conversion apparatus (such as ATP in cells), and catalysts for self-construction processes. These components enable the system to maintain its organization and identity, even in the face of environmental perturbations.

The text then compares autopoiesis (cellular life) with sensorimotor closure (nervous systems). Autopoietic closure creates a "bodily self" through metabolic processes that construct and maintain cell membranes, while sensorimotor closure generates a "sensorimotor self" by integrating sensory input and motor output in a continuous cycle.

In both cases, selfhood emerges from network closure (autonomy) and its physical embodiment. The organism is viewed as an ensemble of "selﬂess selves" or distributed networks with operational closure. This perspective rejects the notion of a centralized homunculus controlling the system, emphasizing instead the role of emergent patterns across various scales (cellular, somatic, sensorimotor, neurocognitive).

The passage also addresses potential objections to viewing nervous systems and organisms as autonomous. It argues that heteronomy perspectives can be useful for specific contexts but do not adequately explain the internal dynamics and self-production of biological systems. Instead, an autonomy perspective focuses on how systems produce and maintain their organization through endogenous processes, forming a context-dependent and agent-relative understanding of information.

In this view, information is dynamically embodied within a system, not pre-existing or externally imposed. It emerges from the system's own operations and structural coupling with the environment. Meaning, in this sense, arises as coherent patterns of behavior that make a difference to the system.

The passage references the work of Howard Pattee (1977), who distinguishes between linguistic and dynamical modes of description for complex systems. Linguistic descriptions involve discrete, rate-independent symbols, while dynamical descriptions encompass continuous, rate-dependent processes that include time's flow. Pattee argues that a self-describing system must "read and write its own messages" to avoid observer-relative interpretations.

The text highlights the complementarity of linguistic and dynamical modes in understanding information. In biological systems, like cells, genetic codes (linguistic descriptions) emerge from and constrain dynamic processes (dynamical descriptions). The stability and predictability of these patterns allow for linguistic abstractions that simplify our understanding while retaining essential features of the system's operation.

In summary, this passage advocates an autonomy perspective on biological systems, cognition, and information processing. It emphasizes context-dependent, dynamic meanings emerging from operational closure in structural coupling with the environment, rejecting the notion of pre-existing, context-independent representations. This view highlights the importance of understanding natural cognitive agents as self-producing systems that generate meaning through their own endogenous dynamics and interactions with the world.


The text discusses the concepts of autonomy and emergence within the enactive approach, a theoretical framework that emphasizes the role of interaction between an organism (or system) and its environment. 

1. **Autonomy**: In this context, an autonomous system does not rely on internal representations (like a subjective/objective view would suggest). Instead, it actively constitutes or enacts its environment based on its structure and actions. This sensorimotor world or Umwelt is specific to the organism's capacities—in the case of animals, this is their sensorimotor repertoire. The nervous system plays a crucial role in establishing an autonomous identity by connecting distant sensory and motor processes into operationally closed networks. 

2. **Emergence**: Emergence, as understood by the enactive approach, refers to dynamic co-emergence where parts and whole mutually specify each other. It contrasts with standard notions of emergence in complex systems theory, which involve collective self-organization without direct reciprocity between the parts and the whole. 

   - **Standard Emergence**: This involves a system spontaneously organizing itself based on locally defined interactions influenced by control parameters (like temperature gradient in Bénard cells example). It doesn't have an internal 'self' dictating the patterns; rather, these patterns arise from the collective behavior of elements. The global structures influence local interactions without altering individual components directly but via changes in control parameters or boundary conditions.
   
   - **Dynamic Co-Emergence**: This concept highlights the mutual specification between parts and whole. Parts depend on the whole for their identity, and conversely, the whole depends on the parts for its manifestation. A prime example is autopoiesis – a self-maintaining system where components produce each other and form an integrated network.

3. **Autonomy and Emergence in Life Systems**: Autonomous systems, like cells or organisms, are self-producing entities that bring forth their domains of interactions (milieu). Unlike typical dissipative structures dependent on external conditions for self-organization, autonomous systems endogenously create and maintain the constraints guiding energy/matter flows. This form of emergence goes beyond simple pattern formation in physical systems because it involves a cyclical relationship where the whole gives rise to parts, and vice versa. 

In essence, the enactive approach posits that meaningful interactions between organisms and environments lead to the co-emergence of both entities—an idea central to understanding life processes, cognition, emotion, and consciousness.


The text provided is an extensive index from a philosophical or scientific work, likely focusing on the topics of consciousness, cognition, and complex systems. Here's a detailed summary and explanation of some key concepts:

1. Cognitivism: This is a theory of mind and intelligence that posits mental states are constituted by internal representations or symbols manipulated according to formal rules. It can be contrasted with connectionism (which views the mind as a collection of interconnected neuron-like processing elements) and dynamic systems theory (which focuses on the self-organizing, non-linear processes in complex systems).

2. Connectionism: This is a theoretical approach to understanding cognition that models mental phenomena using networks of simple, interconnected processing units or "neurons." It contrasts with cognitivism by emphasizing the distribution of information across many elements rather than localized representations.

3. Dynamic Systems Theory: This is an interdisciplinary approach that studies complex systems' behavior over time through nonlinear dynamics. It's often applied to understanding living systems and their emergent properties, contrasting with more traditional reductionist approaches.

4. Consciousness: The text discusses various aspects of consciousness, including its characterization, relation to attention and time-consciousness, and the "hard problem" of explaining how physical processes give rise to subjective experience (qualia). It also explores different philosophical views on consciousness, such as Cartesian dualism, materialism, and panpsychism.

5. Emergence: This concept refers to patterns arising from the interaction of simpler components that cannot be predicted solely from knowledge of those components. In the text, emergence is discussed in the context of complex systems, life, and mind, often contrasting with reductionist views. Different types of emergence (global-to-local, local-to-global) and emergent processes are explored.

6. Autopoiesis: This term refers to self-producing or self-maintaining systems. In biology, it's used to describe living organisms' ability to maintain their identity and structure through chemical reactions within their boundaries. The concept is central to understanding life as a complex system.

7. Developmental Systems Theory (DST): This is an interdisciplinary approach that studies the organization of development across various levels, from genes to ecology. It challenges traditional views on inheritance and evolution by emphasizing the importance of time, history, and context in shaping organisms' characteristics.

8. Enactivism: This theoretical perspective posits that cognition arises through a dynamic interaction between an organism and its environment, blurring the traditional distinction between internal mental states and external processes. It's often contrasted with more cognitivist or connectionist views.

9. Evolution: The text discusses different aspects of evolutionary theory, including biological vs. cultural evolution, contingent vs. convergent evolution, and the relationship between genetics, development, and environment in shaping life forms' characteristics. It also touches on debates within evolutionary theory, such as gene selectionism (genocentrism) versus developmental systems theory.

10. Phenomenology: This is a philosophical movement that focuses on the study of experiences from the first-person perspective. In the text, phenomenology is discussed in the context of understanding consciousness, particularly through the work of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger.

11. Complex Systems: These are systems characterized by a large number of interacting components giving rise to emergent properties and behaviors not directly predictable from their individual parts. The text discusses various aspects of complex systems, including self-organization, nonlinear dynamics, and the relationship between structure and behavior in such systems.


Heterophenomenology is a method introduced by philosopher Daniel Dennett. It's an approach to understanding consciousness that aims to bridge the gap between first-person subjective experiences (qualia) and third-person, scientific accounts of the brain. The term "heterophenomenology" combines elements from two sources: phenomenology, a philosophical method developed by Edmund Husserl that focuses on the study of conscious experience as it's lived and perceived, and interphenomenology, an approach advocated by Maurice Merleau-Ponty that emphasizes understanding through a shared exploration of phenomena between researcher and subject.

In heterophenomenology, Dennett posits that instead of directly accessing the internal experiences of others (or even oneself), we can make reliable inferences about them based on their public behavior, verbal reports, and the context in which these behaviors occur. This method is "hetero" because it involves a form of external observation rather than direct introspection or participation in the subjective experience itself. 

Dennett's heterophenomenology consists of three main components:

1. **The Method of Arbitration**: This involves making judgments about the contents of consciousness based on a careful analysis of publicly observable behavior and verbal reports. Dennett suggests that we should accept a hypothesis about what someone is experiencing if it best explains their behavior, verbal reports, and other contextual evidence. 

2. **The Method of Ascent**: This method involves moving from the third-person perspective to the first-person perspective by carefully designing thought experiments or simulations based on scientific data. By doing so, one can gain insights into the nature of conscious experience from a first-person viewpoint without having direct access to it.

3. **The Method of Explanation**: This method focuses on developing scientific theories that can explain and predict aspects of consciousness based on observable phenomena and physical principles. It aims to provide a comprehensive, naturalistic account of mental states and processes.

Dennett argues that heterophenomenology allows for a rigorous, empirically informed study of consciousness while avoiding the pitfalls of solipsism or unverifiable first-person reports. However, critics argue that this method still relies on verbal reports, which may not fully capture subjective experiences, and might dismiss essential aspects of consciousness by focusing solely on observable behaviors.


The text provided is an extensive index of philosophical, psychological, and biological concepts related to consciousness, self, and living systems. Here's a detailed summary and explanation of some key entries:

1. **Prereflexive experience**: This refers to the immediate, non-reflective experience of the world before it is processed by higher cognitive functions. It's often described as the "raw data" of consciousness, which includes sensory perceptions and bodily feelings.

2. **Prereflexive self-awareness**: This concept pertains to an individual's awareness of their own mental states and bodily sensations without reflecting on them or labeling them as 'self'. It's a precursor to the more developed, introspective form of self-awareness.

3. **Preformationism**: An old theory in biology suggesting that organisms develop from tiny, preformed structures within the parent organism (e.g., sperm cells containing miniature adults). This theory has been largely replaced by modern developmental biology.

4. **Presentness**: In the context of time-consciousness, presentness refers to the immediacy and vividness we attribute to the current moment in experience. It's a complex concept that involves the interplay between memory, anticipation, and the perceived "now."

5. **Presentation vs. re-presentation**: Presentation refers to the initial encounter with something (e.g., seeing a tree for the first time), while re-presentation occurs when we recall or imagine that thing later on (e.g., remembering the tree or visualizing it in our mind's eye).

6. **Protocells**: Hypothetical simple, non-living entities that could have given rise to life through chemical evolution. They are often characterized by their ability to self-replicate and maintain a boundary (a primitive form of membrane) separating them from the environment.

7. **Purposiveness**: This concept relates to the idea that certain phenomena appear to be goal-directed or purposeful, even if they lack conscious intentionality. In nature, purposiveness might refer to the way complex systems seem to exhibit behaviors serving specific functions (e.g., a leaf's shape facilitating photosynthesis).

8. **Quantitative discontinuity**: A term used in philosophy of science to describe situations where small changes in initial conditions lead to drastically different outcomes—a hallmark of complex systems and chaos theory.

9. **Quantum theory**: A fundamental theory in physics describing nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and subatomic particles. Its principles have been proposed as a basis for understanding consciousness (e.g., the Orchestrated Objective Reduction, or Orch-OR, hypothesis).

10. **Reactant criterion**: In autopoietic organization, this refers to the idea that a system's components must interact in a way that drives the system toward self-maintenance and self-replication.

11. **Recursive function**: A mathematical function that can be defined in terms of itself, often used in computer science and mathematics to model complex systems and processes.

12. **Reductionism vs. Emergentism**: Reductionism is the approach that explains complex phenomena by reducing them to simpler components and their interactions. Emergentism, on the other hand, posits that complex systems exhibit properties not present in their individual parts—properties that can't be fully explained by their lower-level components alone.

13. **Reﬂex theory**: A philosophical theory suggesting that consciousness arises from specific types of reflexes or automatic responses within the nervous system, rather than being a fundamental feature of the mind itself.

14. **Relational holism**: The view that complex systems (like living organisms) should be understood primarily in terms of their relationships with other systems and their environment, rather than focusing on internal components or processes alone.

15. **Self-organization**: The spontaneous formation of organized structures or patterns within a system without external direction—a key concept in understanding the emergence of complex behavior from simple interactions at lower levels (e.g., how cells organize into tissues and organs).

16. **Selﬁsh gene theory**: Proposed by biologist Richard Dawkins, this theory argues that evolution can be understood primarily in terms of genes "selfishly" promoting their own replication, rather than focusing on the organism as a whole or the benefits to species survival.

17. **Self-maintenance**: The ability of a system to sustain its structure and functions over time through internal processes, often involving feedback loops that adjust the system in response to changes in its environment.

18. **Sensorimotor coupling**: The close integration between sensory input and motor output in living systems, allowing for adaptive behavior based on perceptions of the environment. This concept is central to enactive approaches to cognition and consciousness.

19. **Sense-making**: The process by which individuals make meaning from their experiences, often involving interpretation, categorization, and integration with existing knowledge structures. It's a fundamental aspect of human cognition and can occur at various levels, from perception to abstract thought.

20. **Sentience**: The capacity for feeling or experiencing subjectively, typically associated with conscious beings capable of having painful or pleasurable sensations and emotions. It's a broader concept than "awareness" or "consciousness," encompassing more than just the ability to attend to stimuli.

These concepts are interconnected in various ways, forming a rich tapestry of ideas that help explain aspects of consciousness, selfhood, and living systems from philosophical, psychological, and biological perspectives.

Title: Observation of Multiple Time Crystals in a Driven-Dissipative System with Rydberg Gas

Summary:

This research, published in Nature Communications, reports the observation of multiple time crystals in a driven-dissipative system using Rydberg gas. The study introduces continuous time crystals (CTC), sub-harmonic time crystals, and high-harmonic time crystals observed within the same system by manipulating Rydberg excitation.

Key Points:

1. Time Crystals: These are temporal analogs of spatial crystals, exhibiting stable periodic behavior that breaks time translation symmetry. In an open quantum system, many-body interactions under dissipation can induce this order, leading to dissipative time crystals.

2. Experimental Setup: The experiment involves an ensemble of Rydberg atoms at room temperature, where two laser beams (probe and coupling) excite ground state atoms to the Rydberg state via an intermediate state. This forms a ladder-type electromagnetically induced transparency configuration, with strong interactions governed by the van der Waals interaction between Rydberg atoms.

3. Observation of Multiple Time Crystalline Phases: The researchers used scanned EIT spectroscopy to manipulate Rydberg excitation (via control laser frequency) and observed different time crystalline phases:

   - Continuous Time Crystals (CTC): Oscillations were observed at specific ranges of two-photon detuning. The oscillation frequency was found to be linearly proportional to the coupling laser Rabi frequency, as shown in Fig. 1f and simulated in Fig. 1g.
   
   - Sub-harmonic Time Crystals: By increasing the coupling Rabi frequency further (from ~2.3 MHz to ~2.8 MHz), another persistent oscillation with a lower frequency (half of CTC) was observed, confirming sub-harmonic time crystal behavior (Fig. 2a and inset).
   
   - High-Harmonic Time Crystals: Further increasing the coupling Rabi frequency up to ~5.0 MHz revealed higher-order harmonics in addition to CTC and sub-harmonic oscillations (Fig. 3a). These emergent frequencies were found to increase linearly with the coupling laser Rabi frequency, as shown in Figs. 3b2-e2.

4. Theoretical Explanation: A three-level model is proposed to explain these observations. This Hamiltonian includes detunings for probe and coupling lasers, Rydberg excitation terms, and van der Waals interaction terms between Rydberg atoms.

Implications:

This work provides new ways to explore non-equilibrium phases of matter in open systems and may lead to the development of time crystals as a ubiquitous tool in quantum metrology for continuous sensing and parameter estimation surpassing the standard quantum limit.


The text describes a study on the observation of complex time crystalline orders in thermal Rydberg gases under continuous driving. The main findings include three distinct phases: continuous time crystal (CTC), sub-harmonic time crystal, and high-harmonic time crystal.

1. Continuous Time Crystal (CTC): This phase emerges due to the nonlinearity of Rydberg interactions, leading to oscillatory solutions in the parameter space even with a time-independent drive. The CTC can exhibit different behaviors depending on the system parameters:

   - Steady state (SS): The Rydberg population approaches one stable solution.
   - Bistable state (BS): The observable converges to two stable values.
   - Oscillatory and bistable state (OBS): Self-sustained oscillations occur for the upper branch solution, with a continuously varying oscillation period. This is interpreted as a manifestation of CTC, and its frequency relation agrees with experimental findings.

2. Sub-harmonic Time Crystal: As the Rabi frequency of the coupling laser increases beyond the CTC phase, sub-harmonic time crystals emerge. These are explained by periodic driving resulting from collisions between Rydberg atoms and ground-state atoms that generate charged particles. The periodic electric fields produced due to these charged particles shift the resonance condition of Rydberg excitation via the Stark effect, leading to a subharmonic response in the system.

3. High-harmonic Time Crystal: At even stronger Rabi drives and lower detunings, nonlinear interactions dominate over other effects. The oscillation frequency scales linearly with the Rabi frequency, as predicted by theory. Numerical simulations confirm that a higher Rydberg population enhances interactions, leading to an increase in oscillatory frequency—a result consistent with experimental findings.

The study highlights the potential of thermal Rydberg gases as an out-of-equilibrium platform for exploring exotic dynamic phases and suggests applications in quantum metrology and time crystalline order as a frequency standard. The theoretical model used is based on a three-level atomic system, with the Lindblad master equation describing the open system dynamics. Mean-field approximations are employed to handle strong nonlinear interactions, allowing for numerical solutions of the equations of motion using the Runge-Kutta method.


Title: "Observation of a Time Crystal in a Driven-Dissipative Quantum Many-Body System"

The paper presents an experiment that observes a time crystal, a state of matter that exhibits periodic dynamics broken translation symmetry in time. The researchers achieve this using a driven-dissipative quantum many-body system composed of ultracold Rydberg atoms.

Rydberg atoms are atoms with at least one valence electron excited to high principal quantum numbers, resulting in strong dipole-dipole interactions and long lifetimes. These unique properties make them suitable for realizing exotic phases of matter, including time crystals.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the work:

1. **System Description**: The system consists of around 500 ultracold rubidium atoms trapped in an optical lattice. By applying microwave pulses (driving) and managing decay processes due to spontaneous emission (dissipation), the researchers create a complex quantum many-body dynamics.

2. **Time Crystal Signature**: The signature of a time crystal is a periodic, robust oscillation in an observable quantity. In this study, the authors observe this in the number fluctuations of atoms within the optical lattice. By monitoring these fluctuations using quantum gas microscopy, they identify recurring peaks in the autocorrelation function at a specific period, indicating the formation of a time crystal.

3. **Driving and Dissipation**: The driving is achieved through microwave pulses that periodically transfer atoms between internal states, while dissipation is managed by spontaneous emission that causes atom loss from the lattice. Together, these processes create a non-equilibrium setting where the system can exhibit unusual phases like time crystals.

4. **Experimental Results**: By varying the driving frequency and strength, the researchers observe different time crystal phases. They also study the system's stability by introducing perturbations (quenching) and show that the time crystal persists over many drive periods, indicating its robustness against external disturbances.

5. **Theoretical Understanding**: The authors explain their findings using a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model. They also perform numerical simulations to complement their experimental observations and deepen the theoretical understanding of the time crystal formation in this system.

6. **Implications and Future Directions**: This work opens avenues for studying novel phases of matter and dynamical processes in driven-dissipative quantum many-body systems. It also demonstrates the potential of Rydberg atoms as a platform to investigate time crystals and other exotic quantum phenomena in out-of-equilibrium settings.

In summary, this paper reports the observation of a time crystal in a driven-dissipative quantum many-body system composed of ultracold Rydberg atoms. The study showcases the potential of such systems to realize and study exotic phases of matter, paving the way for future research on out-of-equilibrium quantum phenomena.
