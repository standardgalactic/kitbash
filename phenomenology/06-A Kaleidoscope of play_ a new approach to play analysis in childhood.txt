ABSTRACT
Play is a frequent and relevant activity during childhood, and 
developmental psychologists agree that it offers a unique 
window on development. Play, however, remains a fuzzy 
concept, and difficulties persist in its definition, often leading 
to obstacles in building and comparing experimental studies. 
This may be due to widespread tendencies to define play by 
referring to non-observable inner states, to consider playing 
something that occurs in the head rather than in-the-world 
and to overreliance on developmental stages. Enactive 
approaches to child play have instead recently stressed the 
importance of play contexts, considering child play an activ­
ity in-the-world rather than a mental state, thereby de- 
intellectualizing play and pretense. Along these lines, in this 
paper the authors propose a novel approach to the definition 
of play types by considering the roles of organism, environ­
ment, and task constraints, within the framework of Material 
Engagement Theory. Focusing on the material world sur­
rounding the child and the interactions which characterize 
play, we critically review the strategy of resorting to non- 
observable categories in the study of play, and we propose 
a new model (the Kaleidoscope Model) for play analysis.

1. Introduction: two riddles on play
For children, play is a natural and spontaneous act coloring a great number 
of daily activities, but for developmental psychologists it is both a complete 
riddle and the perfect setting to observe child development. Contrary to 
eating and sleeping, play does not appear to be directly associated with 
a child's physiological needs, and rather than being a means to an end it 
seems to be an activity without a specific goal. Therefore, the first riddle 
about play is: why do children play?

This question received many different answers throughout the history of 
developmental psychology. Jean Piaget considered child play an opportunity 
to enact acquired behaviors in contexts detached from the ones that char­
acterize their acquisition. In his view, play skills are linked to specific 
developmental stages and consolidated, rather than acquired, through repe­
tition and reorganization ([Piaget, 1962]). Lev Vygotsky valued play as 
a child's invention, a pleasure space, intrinsically linked to social rules that 
in real-life experiences are condensed and employed by others, but in which 
the child is able to use these rules more broadly and freely ([Vygotsky, 
1976]). For Gregory Bateson play leads from a two-dimensional world of 
necessity into a three-dimensional world of possibility and fantasy - a door 
through which we need to step in order to acquire cultural symbols. In this 
view, the contribution of play to development should not be sought in its 
contents, as much as in its processes, as play allows one to learn about 
learning ([Bateson, 1955]). Other authors stressed the importance of play in 
producing spaces in which objects are used in "as if" situations as well as 
a way to discover novel prototypes and associations that constitute an 
adaptive potential to be used when in need ([Sutton-Smith, 1967, 1976]). 
Alternatively, play may create a safe environment in which to freely and 
flexibly exercise motor skills detached from their consequences in real-life 
scenarios ([Bruner, 1972]). These theories differ in conceiving play either as 
a locus where child skills are exercised or a forge shaping them, but they 
agree in recognizing that when a child starts to play we are offered a unique 
opportunity to observe development in action ([Rubin et al., 1983]). 
Therefore, a wealth of studies have been dedicated to analyzing children's 
play at different ages (mostly between 4 months and 11 years of age), in 
different contexts (in home, school, lab, or outdoor environments), in 
different cultures and socio-economic realities (which influence play on 
multiple levels), with different materials (toys, tools, and natural objects) 
and in different situations (alone, with peers, and with caregivers). But 
whatever the experimental setting, and however constrained or not the 
conditions may be, parsing out and analyzing quantitative and qualitative 
aspects of children's play remains to date a difficult task. This leads to 
the second riddle about play: what is child play?
Many authors have stressed that this second question is hard to 
answer, due to the fuzziness of the concept, which raises multiple 
definitional problems ([Lillard, 2015; Rubin et al., 1983; Sparaci & 
Bonsignori, 2023]). For example, consider the following behaviors: (A) 
a young infant starts blowing raspberries, the mother smiles, the infant 
notices her smile, blows more raspberries and then laughs; (B) an infant 
on her highchair bangs a spoon, while her mother is attempting to feed 
her; (C) a toddler puts a wooden stick in the sand and turns it; (D) 
a child points at a cloud and says: "My favorite dragon". All these acts

stand at the cross-roads between play and other skills. In fact, they may 
be listed as different types of play, but they could just as well be 
considered communicative acts (A), exploratory behaviors (B), func­
tional actions (C), or daydreaming (D), which fall outside the realm of 
play.
Difficulties with defining play persist today and, far from being only 
a theoretical problem, they impact experimental research: without 
a definition of a behavior, it becomes hard to parse it out and analyze it, 
while the existence of multiple contrasting definitions makes comparisons 
between data extremely complex. In this paper, we do not presume to reach 
a unique definition of play, nor fully address all forms of play occurring 
among different cultures around the globe, but rather to propose a new 
theoretical roadmap for its definition, largely influenced by current enactive 
approaches to cognitive development. Our aim is to provide a common 
theoretical background, while highlighting some common aspects of play 
that have been overlooked or misconceived by current theories of play. We 
will begin by presenting two different strategies that have been employed in 
defining childhood play. These are based, respectively, on: psychological 
dispositions and play types. However, as we shall see, both strategies find 
their main limit in an overreliance on non-observable inner states, consid­
ering playing something that occurs in the head rather than in-the-world.
2. Defining play: dispositional approaches vs. play types
One strategy for defining play is to pinpoint psychological dispositions 
which characterize it and mark its occurrence. Dispositional approaches 
describe play as characterized by intrinsic motivations, attention to 
means rather than ends, presence of non-literal and simulative acts, 
guided by organism-dominated questions and active engagement of par­
ticipants ([Rubin et al., 1983]). This rules out behaviors, highlighted 
above, that do not fall within play (communicative acts, exploratory 
behaviors, functional actions, daydreaming), defining play as an enclosed 
concept. Play is understood as intrinsically motivated because it is not 
governed by physiological needs or externally induced. Children across 
the globe spontaneously play to various extents and in different ways 
often displaying common developmental patterns, even if child play is 
characterized by tremendous variability across culture and social class 
([Lillard, 2015]). Often enough play goals are not external to the behavior 
itself,1 which allows distinguishing play from communicative acts (A). In 
play children focus on processes rather than end states and this, along­
side the frequent presence of simulative acts, sets play apart from real-life 
functional actions (C). Furthermore, in its relation to objects, play seems 
to be led by organism-dominated questions such as "what can I do with 
720
L. SPARACI AND S. GALLAGHER

this object?" rather than environmentally guided questions such as "what 
is this object?", distinguishing play from exploratory behaviors (B) ([C. 
Hutt, 1966, p. 76; S. J. Hutt et al., 1989]). Finally, play requires active 
engagement of its players, disentangling it from other pleasant or restful 
activities such as daydreaming or loafing (D).
Dispositional approaches thus distinguish play from other behaviors and 
highlight often-overlooked aspects of play. However, these definitions seem 
at best useful in clarifying specific aspects of a play behavior once this has 
been detected, rather than parsing out bouts of play within a child's daily 
activities. For example, in observing a toddler shaking a nut, how can we 
state that she is led by organism-dominated play questions (such as "what 
can I do with this?"), rather than environmentally guided questions, which 
characterize object exploration (such as "what is this thing?"), or no ques­
tions at all? A common approach in developmental psychology is to rely on 
detailed structural analyses of observed actions rather than inner disposi­
tion. For example, given that functional object-directed actions, in contrast 
with play, usually tend toward behavioral optimization, through removal of 
unnecessary and redundant action components, repeated observations may 
allow us to parse out functional acts from play behaviors in non-human 
primates ([Candland et al., 1978; Hughes, 1979; Fragaszy et al., 2010; Cenni 
et al., 2020]). In other cases, the intrinsic organization of specific action 
sequences may allow parsing out exploratory behaviors from functional acts 
in infants ([Zelazo & Kearsley, 1980; Sparaci et al., 2018]). However, this 
way of distinguishing play from other actions (e.g., exploratory actions) is 
based on observed behavior sequences rather than the ascription of inner 
dispositions.
Therefore, dispositional approaches may at best be used to occasionally 
rule out non-play behaviors or to flag ambiguous cases, but relying on such 
an approach in order to ascribe often arbitrary and non-observable inner 
states to the child makes them of little use in applied research. Conceiving 
play as an enclosed concept, we may delimit its boarders, but we will possess 
little information of its landscape, which would instead be essential in 
parsing out play behaviors.
An alternative approach, then, is to define play based on observable 
behaviors. Given that multiple behaviors, across the globe, may be consid­
ered occurrences of play, developmental psychologists often parse these 
behaviors into different types defining them and distinguishing one from 
the other. This is a significant shift. The analysis of play types allows moving 
away from an enclosed concept of play, toward a more open concept, 
possibly based on similarities and relationships among observable behaviors 
([Sparaci & Bonsignori, 2023]). To clarify what this means, it will be useful 
to briefly describe the main play types often described as characterizing 
early development, which include exploratory, relational, functional, and 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
721

pretend play (see Figure 1A). It is important to state that while these play 
types have been found in multiple cultures, play is characterized by tremen­
dous variability across cultures and social class, as will be better described 
below ([Lillard, 2015]).
Exploratory play is one of the first play types to emerge around 4 months 
of age, when infants, as they grasp objects, begin to enact patterns of 
sensorimotor exploration (rubbing, shaking, scratching, banging, poking, 
mouthing). These patterns gradually grow in complexity as independent 
sitting, freeing the hands, allows for longer and more sophisticated play 
bouts ([Gibson, 2000; Halverson, 1943; Vondra & Belsky, 1989; Lockman 
2000; Connolly & Elliott, 1972; Gesell & Ilg, 1937; Newell, 1986; Iverson, 
2010]). Exploratory play is usually repeated and accompanied by emotional 
displays of pleasure which may be shared with caregivers or peers, which 
contribute toward distinguishing it from simple exploratory (B) or commu­
nicative actions (A). For example, an infant may shake a rattle to produce 
a sound, while looking at her mother and laughing ([Lifter et al., 1993; 
Uzgiris & Hunt, 1975]). However, this distinction is at times hard to make.
Between 7 and 18 months, infants start putting multiple objects together 
leading to relational play, enacting more complex play sequences. These are 
characterized initially by the juxtaposition of objects in an unrelated way but

rendering of play types as juxtaposed in development.
722
L. SPARACI AND S. GALLAGHER

are soon followed by behaviors progressively suggesting awareness, if not 
enactments, of objects' functional use ([Belsky & Most, 1981; Fenson et al., 
1976; Lifter & Bloom, 1989; Rosenblatt, 1977; Zelazo & Kearsley, 1980; 
Vondra & Belsky, 1989]). The juxtaposition of objects characterizes rela­
tional play, while once again specific quality and timing of co-occurring 
behaviors (social smiling, eye gaze, vocalizations, gestures, etc.) are typically 
used to distinguish relational play from exploratory acts (B) - once again 
leading to rather subtle distinctions.
Around 10 months of age infants begin to clearly use objects within 
specific function-related action sequences (e.g., grasping a spoon by its 
handle to eat), enacting functional play schemes ([Connolly & Dalgleish, 
1989]). Functional play is distinguished from previous play types, as it 
demonstrates in children a clear knowledge of object affordances and use, 
which could previously only be inferred ([Zelazo & Kearsley, 1980]). For 
example, if a child grasps a spoon from its handle and places it in a cup, it is 
impossible to establish whether this is just relational play or the prelude to 
functional play. In fact, this act may just be the product of repeated 
encounters with specific contexts or scripts in which this layout occurs. 
But, if a child turns a spoon in an empty cup, knowledge of object affor­
dances and function becomes more apparent. Co-occurring behaviors (eye 
gaze, vocalizations, etc.) are used in this case to distinguish play occurrences 
from simple functional acts (C) [see Sparaci et al. (2018) and Fanning et al. 
(2020) for an example of how these distinctions may affect experimental 
research].
By the end of the first year child play undergoes one of the most 
relevant observable changes as pretend play emerges. This begins with 
a gradual increase in forms of de-contextualization, occurring when 
a familiar action (e.g., drinking, eating, and sleeping) is detached from 
its typical time or space of execution and produced in another situa­
tional context (e.g., pretending to sleep on a book instead of a pillow 
or at a time that is neither nap nor bed time) ([Bates, 1979]). Initially, 
de-contextualization is related to the self (e.g., the child pretends to 
eat with a spoon), but soon after it comes to include other agents 
both real and imaginary (e.g., a child pretends to feed his mother or 
a doll) ([Fein, 1975]). Furthermore, while others are initially passive 
agents, between 12 and 30 months they become active (e.g., a child 
feeds a doll then lays her to sleep and pretends to speak in an 
undertone so as not to wake it). Pretend acts and scenarios become 
increasingly more complex during the second and third years as 
children move from single actions (e.g., combing the mother's hair) 
to ordered combinations (e.g., combing the mother's hair and then 
holding a mirror so that she can look at it) ([Nicholich, 1977; Fenson 
& Ramsay, 1980]). These scenarios often resemble situations 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
723

experienced in real-life or stretching into imaginary narratives, and 
the amount of engagement and effort that the child invests in building 
them is typically used to distinguish them from other behaviors such 
as daydreaming (D). We will say more on the definition of pretend 
play below.
Summing up, play types capture different play-related behaviors in early 
childhood and frame attempts to distinguish play from the non-play beha­
viors that we have listed above. However, in the case of play types, these 
distinctions are often not easily made. It is important to note that usually 
each play type co-occurs with the acquisition or with being in the process of 
acquiring specific sensory-motor and/or cognitive skills (e.g., exploratory 
play is boosted by independent sitting, functional play requires knowledge 
of object affordances, etc.). Furthermore, play types are defined based on 
multiple behaviors and on their material or social context of execution (e.g., 
social smiles contribute to pinpoint exploratory play, while the presence of 
multiple objects is essential for relational play). More will be said on these 
aspects below.
Even if play types support more detailed descriptions of play behaviors 
allowing researchers to parse out the specific play landscapes, current 
definitions still present some major drawbacks. First, there is a persistent 
Piagetian tendency to consider play as progressing in a neat stage-like 
succession during development, which fails to capture the fact that multiple 
play behaviors may co-exist and overlap in development. For example, 
functional play is considered as a precursor of pretend play, but child 
pretense often exploits functional play acts (e.g., pretending to feed a doll 
with a spoon a child also enacts a functional play act). Therefore, it is often 
hard if not impossible to correctly set a border between play types ([Sinclair, 
1989]). In placing such borders, authors often end up relying on specific 
cognitive skills, leading to the second drawback: definitions of individual 
play types end up once again relying on non-observable inner states. Finally, 
these play types largely derive from studies conducted on Western and 
middle-class samples, leading to obvious methodological problems in cross- 
cultural investigations, i.e., categories designed in one culture may not be 
appropriate in the analysis of behavior in another ([Prosser et al., 1986]). For 
example, as shown by Feitelson's (1977) seminal presence of specific toys 
(e.g., dolls) or acts (e.g., imitation) in non-Western societies should not be 
automatically interpreted as indicating occurrences of pretend play. And, 
more importantly, even if occurrences of a specific play type are found in 
non-Western societies, these should be analyzed by keeping in mind that 
"style of play in any one society is by no means a random occurrence, but is 
instead closely linked to its social make-up" ([Feitelson, 1977, p. 9]). As we 
shall see below, this leads to considering other factors which influence and 
shape specific play types.
724
L. SPARACI AND S. GALLAGHER

To better illustrate problematic issues linked to play types, we will now 
consider more closely definitions of a specific play type: pretend play.
3. Limits of play types: the case of pretense
As we have seen in Western societies pretend play2 emerges around the 
first year, peaking around 4 years, it is still extremely frequent, in different 
forms, until 11 years of age and some authors even stress its continuing 
presence in adulthood ([Lillard, 2015; Göncü & Perone, 2005]). Given its 
longevity, it is not surprising that pretend play has attracted major research 
attention and that it has come to include many different behaviors. 
Therefore, it is extremely hard to produce a "watertight" definition of 
pretend play ([Leslie, 1987, p. 414]). Multiple criteria have been applied to 
infer that a young child is pretending: treating inanimate objects as animate 
(feeding a doll), performing an activity in the absence of its necessary 
materials (drinking from an empty cup); performing acts usually belonging 
to others (cleaning, cooking); performing acts without their usual outcome 
(place a purse over an arm, wave, but not go out); substituting one object for 
another (using a shell as a drinking cup); producing affective or instru­
mental behaviors that show the non-literal quality of an activity (lamenting 
the loss of an imaginary toy) ([McCune-Nicolich, 1981]).
To overcome this difficulty, authors often group all these behaviors under 
the common banner of "as if" states ([Belsky & Most, 1981; Fein, 1975; 
Casby, 2003; McCune-Nicolich, 1981]). This implies considering pretend 
play the mark of symbolic thought, where a signifier (a wooden block) is 
made to stand for or be used "as if" it were a specific signified (a car). This 
definition and its reliance on symbolic thought extends well beyond the 
notion of de-contextualization and originates in the Piagetian statement that 
pretense implies the representation of an absent object and a comparison 
between a given and an imagined element ([Piaget, 1962, p. 111]).
Cognitivist approaches take the definition of pretend play as an "as if" 
state one step further by stating that this kind of symbol manipulation relies 
on mental representations. For example, Alan Leslie famously suggested that 
a child pretending that his cat made of felt is a real cat, that it eats and 
meows, must have a primary mental representation of "cat," which includes 
what real cats usually do (eating and meowing), and a meta-representation 
in pretense that "felt cat-is as if-cat." The two mental representations need 
not only co-exist but must also be kept separate or decoupled in the child's 
mind, so that this may be considered a form of pretense and not an error or 
folly ([Leslie, 1987]). In this view, pretend play requires five elements: 
a pretender, some reality that is pretended about, mental representations 
that differ from reality, layering of the mental representation on reality in 
the same time and space, and awareness in the pretender of all these 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
725

components ([Lillard, 1993]). This results in an internalist definition of 
pretend play: the child's mental capacities occupy center stage and pretense 
is something that happens in the head, rather than a relationally constructed 
skill happening in-the-world. Furthermore, the emergence of pretend play 
may hardly be seen as gradual and is mostly constrained to a narrow 
developmental stage, as the necessary meta-cognitive skills must be in 
place. In anthropological psychology, a critical view of this conception has 
led to underscore environmental factors that have been shown to influence 
pretend play. For example, Feitelson suggests that pretend play quality in 
any society is strongly influenced by four factors: (1) the play space or spaces 
that are allocated to child play in different cultures; (2) the availability of 
sufficient legitimate time away from chores or nursing peers to be dedicated 
to the unfolding of plots or themes which characterize pretend play; (3) 
availability of play objects that are familiar, permanent, and freely available; 
(4) a play conducive atmosphere and in particular adults' attitudes toward 
pretense ([Feitelson, 1977, pp. 10-13]).
The case of pretend play shows how resorting to play types, while broad­
ening our descriptive understanding of play forms, may shackle childhood 
play to a rigid stage-like progression while doing nothing to avoid an 
internalist perspective centered on non-observable inner states. In the 
following section, we will propose a way to overcome these limitations by 
shifting toward a less internalist view, and re-assessing the relevance of 
organism, environmental, and task constraints.
4. From a stage-like progression to the gestalt of play types
Piagetian origins of play types and their tendency to be related to the child 
having acquired or being in the process of acquiring specific skills, induced 
researchers to believe that play types follow each other in an orderly fashion. 
A similar belief characterized also early studies on motor skills: considering 
motor development as a step-wise neurophysiological maturational process 
through which the infant progressed as a whole, and in which milestones 
were reached in a fixed sequence ([Gesell, 1929]). Therefore, initially, 
research on motor skill only gave minor relevance to the organism's relation 
to environment or task space. But data did not add up, and subsequent 
studies began to suggest that action contexts may instead play a very 
relevant role in determining a child's pattern of motor control and 
coordination.
Karl M. Newell described organismic constraints, environmental con­
straints, and task constraints, as essential in the definition of motor skills, 
given that changes in these constraints proved to shape and impact chil­
dren's possibilities for movement [Newell (1986), see also Figure 2A for 
Newell's depiction of the relation between these constraints].3 For example, 
726
L. SPARACI AND S. GALLAGHER

Esther Thelen in a famous series of experiments showed that changes in 
environmental constraints (placing young infants in water) allowed the 
stepping reflex, which disappeared between 4 and 16 weeks, to reappear 
([Thelen et al., 1984]). Data therefore suggested that motor coordination 
and control originate from co-occurring constraints and each skill must be 
evaluated in relation, not only to the child but also to the task and environ­
ment in which he is acting [see Newell (1986), p. 348 for a graphic repre­
sentation of this interaction]. Newell's proposal as well as new empirical 
research led to a significant shift in developmental studies on motor skills: 
understanding motor development as relationally constructed in-the-world, 
rather than something happening only in the head ([Clark, 1998; Thelen & 
Smith, 1996]). In this kind of action and skill complex, involving situated 
interaction of organism-environment-task (a dynamical combination of

and control (Newell, 1986); (B). Graphic rendering of the Kaleidoscope Model for play analysis

functional integration and task dependency [Slors, 2019]) it is important to 
note that typically the environment is highly social, involving not only the 
presence of others but explicit and implicit constraints introduced by 
cultural practices and institutional frameworks ([Gallagher, 2020]). For 
example, as we shall see below, in different cultures play can be cultivated, 
tolerated, or discouraged ([Gaskins et al., 2007]).
In the following sections, we propose to shift our perspective in 
analyzing play types. Play types, we will argue, are better described as 
characterized by a dynamical juxtaposition and interaction, rather 
than a step-wise maturational progression. This new conception of 
play types allows moving beyond the stage-like scenario to explain 
how play types may co-exist and overlap within the same develop­
mental stage. In this view, play types are interrelated in a dynamical 
gestalt from which each play type grows, expands, and loops back into 
(rather than replacing) the previous one, extending specific acquired 
skills to a growing number of environments and tasks as the child 
adapts and copes with them in a dynamical engagement [see 
Figure 1B].
We will start out from Newell's (1986) analysis of the development of 
movement coordination in children. In contrast to traditional theories that 
conceive of the development of motor control as involving the acquisition of 
prescriptions or instructions for action in the form of symbolic knowledge 
structures informing executive function, Newell, as we noted, focused on 
dynamical constraints and distinguished between organism (brain-body), 
environmental and task constraints, to provide a description of how 
a variety of factors shape movement coordination. We take this model as 
a starting point for the enactive and situated analyses of child play. However, 
we will then move away from Newell's model, and introduce the 
Kaleidoscope Model for play analysis, which, in contrast to traditional 
maturational approaches, may better account for creativity in child play.
5. Moving forward: playing-in-the-world
In describing play types, we mention how co-occurrence of specific sensory- 
motor and/or cognitive skills and the presence of multiple behaviors con­
tribute toward their definition. We will now describe how the kaleidoscope 
of forms that make up child play may originate from the dynamic relation 
between three different planes that actively shape its morphology: the 
organism, environment, and task space. This heuristic elaborates on 
Newell's original depiction [Figure 2A], but changes and enriches the para­
meters of these constraints to account for an enactive relation between the 
child and her environment in the context of play [see Figure 2B].

5.1. Organism constraints: structural and functional
In Newell's depiction organismic constraints include structural constraints 
(body weight, height, and shape) and functional constraints (synaptic con­
nections). These must be distinguished as operating on different time scales 
and developing at a different pace. While structural constraints are time 
independent and change very slowly (although systematically) in develop­
ment, functional constraints are relatively time dependent as they change 
more rapidly ([Newell, 1986]). The interplay between structural and func­
tional constraints also shapes changes in other factors such as the movement 
of inertia of each body segment (a bio-mechanical constraint) as well as 
body-schematic processes for motor control. Therefore, organismic con­
straints operate with different degrees of complexity while reciprocally 
influencing each other in complex cycles of feedback within the individual. 
Furthermore, Newell stresses that changes in organismic constraints are in 
turn influenced by elements that may be found outside the individual 
organism (environmental and/or task constraints). For example, a child's 
ability to grasp an object, her motor planning and control will depend on 
object size as well as on her previous experiences [see Figure 2A]. In fact, 
objects in the world with their characteristic shape, weight, texture, and 
mass support specific action sequences, or in other words: "The environ­
ment provides (affords) resources or supports that an animal may (or may 
not) attend to and use" (Gibson, 2000, p. 54). Therefore, the ability to grasp 
and use an object is highly-context related, given that, in order to do so, 
children must detect and relate to object affordances (Lockman - 2000). In 
turn, specific play actions may contribute to a child's physical development 
and to the acquisition of competencies that are of use in adult life. For 
example, the "aim game" played by children in a community in the 
Okavango Delta in Botswana, in which a boy picks a spot on the ground 
and throws a stick at it, has been shown to be preparatory for adult 
competence in hunting [Bock & Johnson 2004].
In regard to play types, this perspective requires going beyond Piagetian 
approaches to consider the development of real-world skills as a form of 
adaptive acting and not as based on abstract, logical and rational thinking 
([Thelen, 2000]). In this view, the nervous system with its functional con­
straints is a dynamic system embedded in and coupled to the body, 
a dynamic system, with its own structural constraints, and together they 
are embedded in and dynamically coupled to the environment within 
specific task spaces ([Thelen, 2000; Chiel & Beer, 1997]). Embodied 
approaches to cognition have contributed toward highlighting how the 
body plays an active part in shaping the emergence and development of 
specific skills ([Gallagher, 2005, 2020]). However, current definitions of play 
types that tend to overly rely on cognitive skills and mental representations, 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
729

thereby overplaying the role of a narrow set of brain-related functional 
organismic constraints and structural organismic constraints are often over­
looked. We suggest that it would be important to gain better understanding 
of their role in play development ([Orr & Geva, 2015]).
For example, we mentioned above the importance of independent sitting 
for exploratory play, given that by freeing the hands sitting allows for longer 
play bouts which in turn lead to longer sitting time ([Iverson, 2010]). 
Similarly, we may consider crawling and walking as opportunities to extend 
the infant's world beyond her proximal surroundings, allowing the infant to 
reach far away objects and supporting combinations which encourage rela­
tional play and enforce gross motor skills ([Karasik et al., 2011]). On the 
other hand, for functional play to emerge specific grasping competencies 
may need to be in place; these, as stated above, will rely not only on brain 
maturation and functional constraints but also on biomechanical con­
straints and child experiences with specific tools and tasks ([Connolly & 
Elliott, 1972]).
The importance of considering different organismic constraints and their 
interplay when analyzing play types is reinforced by studies on both typical 
and atypical development suggesting that fine and gross motor proficiency 
influence play and vice versa ([Butcher & Eaton, 1989; Sparaci et al., 2018; 
Fanning et al., 2020]).
5.2. Environmental constraints: social, cultural, and material
If structural organismic constraints have often been overlooked, play- 
related environmental constraints have been completely underplayed in 
developmental psychology. As pointed out by multiple studies, devel­
opmental psychology has often focused on an excessively thin, and 
rather unusual, slice of humanity: children from Western, Educated, 
Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies ([Henrich 
et al., 2010; Nielsen et al., 2017; McCoy, 2022]). Some forms of play 
have a long history and may be found in multiple cultures and contexts. 
For example, Lancy highlights how games that involve using some kind 
of projectile to dislodge an opponent's stationary target (e.g., marbles) 
were not only already present in the Roman era but described among 
Piaget's Swiss children, as well as among children in Sulawesi, Fiji, and 
Liberia ([D. ,Lancy, 2022, pp. 216-219]). Similarly, "sowing" games, 
which involve scooping up playing pieces and dropping them in spe­
cific holes or pits, are common in Africa (i.e., bao), the Middle East 
(i.e., mancala), Asia (i.e., sungka), America (e.g., wari), and Europe 
(e.g., Bohnenspiel) ([D., Lancy, 2022, p. 227]). Even if games stay the 
same, the ways in which they are played differ greatly, and while 
Piaget's observations on Swiss marble players may be used as reference, 
730
L. SPARACI AND S. GALLAGHER

environmental constraints play an important role in shaping games 
across the world ([D. F. Lancy, 1996]). However, what we suggest is 
not simply that there may be differences in play types across cultures, 
therefore highlighting a need to adjust our WEIRD lenses to specific 
environmental conditions, but that the WEIRD lens is intrinsically 
biased by an overreliance on mentalizing. For example, we have seen 
above how pretense has been viewed as a symbolic activity occurring 
mostly in the head rather than in-the-world, often assuming an intern­
alist narrow approach in analyzing pretend play. Initial challenges to 
this view may be found in authors criticizing Piaget for considering 
pretense as a solitary activity, which only served to consolidate skills 
that children already possessed and as scarcely dependent on social 
intercourse ([Smolucha & Smolucha, 1998; Göncü & Gaskins, 2007; 
Lillard, 2015]). These authors gladly embraced the more socially 
oriented perspective proposed by Lev Vygotsky, who warned against 
the downfalls of an excessively internalist and intellectualistic approach 
to play behaviors ([Vygotsky, 1976; Smolucha & Smolucha, 1998, 
2021]).
More recently, enactive approaches to pretend play have challenged 
approaches to pretense that rely on the manipulation of mental representa­
tions ([Hutto & Myin, 2017; Gallagher, 2017; Rucinska, 2017, 2019; 
Rucińska & Weichold, 2023]). The enactivist turn also introduced different 
explanatory tools to describe pretend play such as capacities for sense- 
making, social practices, and affordances ([Rucińska & Weichold, 2023]). 
These tools allow researchers to highlight different and interrelated envir­
onmental constraints contributing toward shaping play scenarios. While 
authors do not always agree on how and to what extent environmental 
constraints may shape child play, we will propose three types of environ­
mental constraints: social, cultural, and material. At this point, we are going 
significantly beyond Newell's model, which is concerned with explaining 
movement coordination; play is not reducible to just bodily actions any 
more than it is reducible to symbolic knowledge. Moreover, the environ­
ment is not just the physical surround; it includes social and cultural 
constraints as often stressed by cross-cultural studies ([D. F. Lancy, 2017]).
First of all, it is important to stress how empirical research has shown that 
play types are co-construed and shaped within social interactions and 
molded by overt social behaviors. For example, Lillard and Witherington 
(2004) analyzed the behavior of 36 mothers and their 18-months-old chil­
dren while having a real snack vs. a pretend snack. Mother-child interac­
tions were filmed and later coded in two settings with the same utensils and 
differing only for the presence (real scenario) or absence (pretend scenario) 
of food and drinks ([Lillard & Witherington, 2004]). The researchers ana­
lyzed five behavioral dimensions:
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
731

(1) facial expressions (presence, duration, and referent of smiles);
(2) looking patterns (duration and direction of mothers' gaze);
(3) functional movements (functional actions pertaining to eating, drink­
ing, pouring, and serving);
(4) verbal behavior (total word count and references to objects, snacking 
behaviors, items of consumption, and use of the word "pretend");
(5) nonverbal noises (noises mimicking sound made during eating, 
drinking, serving, and/or pouring, as well as comment noises such 
as laughter and/or "mmm").
Differences were found across all dimensions. In particular, in the pretend 
scenario, mothers smiled more and longer at their actions (facial expres­
sions), they looked longer toward the child, whereas they looked more at the 
task in the real scenario (looking behaviors), they produced more eating-, 
drinking- and serving-related actions, with differences also in movement 
velocity (functional movements such as holding were significantly longer in 
pretend eating than in real-life eating), they also talked more, with some use 
of the word "pretend" and greater references to concrete objects and beha­
viors, but not consumables (verbal behaviors) and made more sound effects 
mostly linked to eating, drinking, and serving noises (non-verbal noises). 
Data from this study show that caregivers actively shape pretend scenarios 
using multiple perceptual, motor, and emotion-related cues.
In a subsequent study, Nishida and Lillard (2007) used sequential analysis 
of mother-child interaction sequences in a similar scenario to capture 
whether the caregivers' cueing would facilitate pretense comprehension in 
children. By considering onset and offset of mothers' behaviors (smiles, 
looks, and functional movements) as well as onset and frequencies of 
children's behaviors (smiles, laughs, and snack-related actions), they con­
cluded that children actually use their mothers' cueing and social referen­
cing in the pretend condition to interpret her unusual actions. These results 
have been replicated using different settings, on older age groups and in 
other cultural contexts, showing consistent results ([Richert & Lillard, 2004; 
Ma & Lillard, 2006; Nakamichi, 2015]).
Taken together, these studies and their fine-grained analyses of 
caregiver-child interactions, show that there may be no need to refer 
to mentalizing skills in defining pretense. What we need to consider 
instead is the extent to which social environments may play an active 
role in shaping pretense in childhood. For example, some authors 
suggest that pretend meanings are often construed and co-construed 
with others in a form of participatory sense-making ([De Jaegher & 
DiPaolo, 2007]). In building these pretend meanings language may play 
different roles which need to be disentangled in order to better under­
stand pretend dynamics [see also Rucińska and Weichold (2023) for 
732
L. SPARACI AND S. GALLAGHER

a full review]. Furthermore, we need to consider how differences in 
social environments may impact pretense. For example, studies obser­
ving joint attention in everyday contexts but considering human infants 
from diverse socio-ecological settings (i.e., infants from western, mid­
dle‐class UK families living near universities, from communities of 
subsistence farmers in Cameroon, and from foraging communities in 
the tropical rain forests of the Central African Republic), show that 
although joint attention is universal, significant variations emerge in 
partner, shared topics, emotional tone, and initiator, reflective of differ­
ences in caregiving style, parental practices, parenting goals, and focus 
([Bard et al., 2021]).
Culture and socio-economic status (SES) are other factors that impact 
child play. For example, while cross-cultural analyses suggest that pretense 
is a widespread and potentially universal activity, cultural and SES variations 
affect both quantity and quality of pretense, as well as the role of pretense 
and imaginative play in cultural activities ([Gaskins, 2013]). In fact, play 
varies across cultures not only in its content, in the type of social interac­
tions that are experienced and in the materials available to children (of 
which more will be said below), but also in the relation between play and 
other everyday activities. Something that we must keep in mind in today's 
multicultural societies.
For example, Gaskins et al. (2007) offer an interesting comparison 
between four societies: North American, Taiwanese, Kpelle, and Yucatan 
Mayan. In North America and Taiwan, play is a cultivated activity: care­
givers support pretend play before the child begins to play spontaneously, 
participate directly in child pretend play, and provide toys specialized for 
pretending as well as physical play spaces. But even within these societies 
some differences emerge related alternatively to gender roles, physical 
environments, or cultural beliefs and traditions. For example, within 
North American families, the relation between parenting beliefs and prac­
tices varies with gender, highlighting that mothers feel their participation in 
play is more mandatory, while fathers have a more discretionary approach 
([Parke, 1996; Haight et al., 1997]). Physical environments or space allo­
cated to play also have an important role as stated above. For example, as 
smaller Taiwanese apartments allow for fewer toys than large North 
American homes, children in Taiwan use fewer toys within play scenarios 
and rely more on ritualized social exchanges. Furthermore, as Confucian 
thought emphasizes the importance of harmonious interaction through 
respecting the elders and adherence to rules, play themes of Taiwanese 
mothers and children revolve less around fantasy worlds, and more around 
everyday social routines with non-kin adults, such as addressing or respond­
ing to a teacher or interacting with a street vendor. Greater cultural differ­
ences emerge, shifting to cultures that accept play without cultivating it, 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY

such as the Liberian Kpelle, or cultures in which play is curtailed, such as the 
Yucatec Mayan. For example, Kpelle children's play is limited by being 
tethered to their mothers or older female siblings, allowing less exploration 
of the environment and less play with same-age peers. While for Yucatan 
Mayan children play it is strongly limited by the time spent in working 
chores or observing adults for learning purposes ([Gaskins et al., 2007]).
Observations of child play in multiple cultures and at different time- 
points allow us to better understand and outline how different environ­
mental constraints (e.g., space, time, toys, and adult attitude) may change 
over time while still contributing to shaping child play ([Edwards, 2000]). 
This brief overview shows how cultural constraints may contribute to 
actively shaping not only play quantity but also its meaning and quality. 
Furthermore, sociocultural approaches to child play have contributed 
toward revising dispositional approaches' definition of play. Investigation 
of specific cultural environments highlights that child play may in fact be 
motivated, goal-oriented, and not always led by pleasure ([Göncü & 
Vadeboncoeur, 2017]). Accordingly, culture is another relevant environ­
mental constraint in child play.
Culture is not only a world of people and instituted practices but also 
a world of things present in space and time. Material culture, which includes 
play materials, constitutes another relevant environmental constraint. Play 
materials may take multiple forms, including everyday objects (a pot and 
wooden spoon present in a kitchen suffice to build a cooking/eating/feeding 
scenario), structured toys (toy sets including small pots and eating utensils 
are explicitly built to elicit pretend cooking/eating/feeding behaviors) and/ 
or unstructured toys (a clam shell and a stick can also become an occasion 
for a cooking/eating/feeding scenario). In fact, play is often not only elicited 
but even shaped by the simple presence of specific material objects and/or 
settings ([Szokolszky, 2006]). Children often learn to make do with what 
materials they have available ([D. ,Lancy, 2022]). For example, Tsimane' 
girls in the Bolivian Amazon build their dolls from plant stems shaved with 
a sharp machete to make hair, then dress them in cloth or cast-off bottle 
wrap, build a "fire" to cook their meal in old tuna cans, and then send them 
on journeys on canoes made of banana bracts ([Martinez-Rodriguez, 2009]). 
To date, however, the role of material culture in active molding play is 
unfortunately rarely analyzed and often considered an accessory in devel­
opmental psychology.
For example, if pretend play is considered mainly a mental transfor­
mation process in which different "as if" states are processed in 
response to diverse objects present in the world, play materials will at 
best have the role of passively initiating specific action patterns, which 
are then actively guided by the child's choice ([Fein, 1975; Piaget, 
1962]). For example, Greta G. Fein recognizes that when children 
734
L. SPARACI AND S. GALLAGHER

build pretend scenarios (a horse feeding scenario), specific play materi­
als (prototypical objects, such as a toy horse and a plastic egg cup) may 
trigger fewer "as if" states than other less prototypical objects (such as 
a horse shape and a clam shell). But, according to her analysis, the 
entire symbol manipulation process takes place in the child's head or at 
best in a social landscape, whereas material objects are completely 
passive ([Fein, 1975]).
What we propose here is a radical revision of this unidirectional and 
intellectualist view. We will argue that play materials, their very shape and 
materiality, play an active role in child play and that the relation between 
children and play materials is bi-directional. This path has rarely been 
explored even by enactive approaches. In fact, while some authors recognize 
the active role of object affordances in shaping play, dynamically influencing 
organismic constraints, as exemplified, for example, in the action- 
perception-action relation ([Rucinska & Reijmers, 2015]), others suggest 
that materials may act as an initial trigger, but meanings are then detached 
from their immediate presence ([DiPaolo et al., 2010]). We wish to highlight 
instead that similar to organismic, social, and cultural constraints, materials 
may actively shape child play. To do this, we borrow some of the dynamics 
of human-object interactions described in Material Engagement Theory 
(MET) ([Malafouris, 2008, 2013]).
MET originated within archeological studies, bringing together the idea 
of a symmetry between the role of humans and artifacts in shaping evolution 
and the extended mind hypothesis ([Clark & Chalmers, 1998; Malafouris & 
Renfrew, 2010; Webmoor & Witmore, 2008]). MET proposes that instead of 
objects being considered as the "mere passive substratum" on which social 
acts are projected or imprinted, we should instead focus on "the sphere of 
the fluid and relational transactions or relations between people and things" 
[Malafouris and Renfrew (2010), p. 2 and 4]. Lambros Malafouris (2008) 
appeals to a description of a potter throwing a vessel on the wheel to explain 
how we can move from an internalist view of agency to a concept of material 
agency. In this situation, every action that the potter performs has a "local 
Background," which includes a set of skills, pre-intentional knowledge, 
practices, and habits realized both in the brain and body, constituting the 
essential know-how for an action to take place ([Malafouris, 2008, p. 32]). 
The potter's clay, its very materiality, presents its physical affordances, 
motivating human action intentions (the potter's intention to grow 
a vessel out of the clay). Actions which characterize pottery making are 
distributed between the potter and the clay, as they are based on a dynamic 
interaction stretching on from the beginning of the act throughout the 
shaping of the pot. This is considered a "collaboration between the potter 
and the mass of wet clay rapidly spinning upon the wheel" ([Malafouris, 
2008, p. 34]). This sort of "dance" between the potter and the clay, in turn 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
735

enables and constrains patterns of action, while agency becomes a relational 
and emergent product of material engagement ([Malafouris, 2008, 2013]).
Moving from pottery to play, we can easily observe that materials and 
play spaces often precede, enable, and constrain specific play types in 
a variety of ways. For example, within a single object, the immediate 
presence of given affordances offered by its material characteristics (shape, 
color, weight, texture, etc.) dynamically shape pretend play in real-time. 
Consider, for example, the following scenario:
One evening I was playing with my 2.5 year old son in the bedroom. Suddenly he 
suggested to play cooking; he grabbed a pillow from the bed, put it on the ground and 
said to me: "This is the stove and I am making a soup". He paused as if looking for 
something to serve as a pot, then said: "I am making bread" and he started to knead 
the pillow. (Szokolszky, 2006, p. 67)
In this case a pillow's presence in the child's immediate environment elicits 
a pretend play proposal, which is immediately changed to accommodate not 
only for the unavailable object (a pretend pot) but for the characteristics of 
the objects which are present and possess specific affordances which entice 
the child to begin one specific narrative scenario rather than another (a 
pillow is soft and "kneadable," therefore making it easier to build a bread 
baking scenario than a cooking one) ([Szokolszky, 2006]).
In a telling study, Chemero and Heyser (2005) pointed out how relevant 
and frequently cited experimental papers on object exploration and pro­
vided few or no details on the nature of the objects selected for these tasks 
([Chemero & Heyser, 2005]). They highlighted the fact that most of the 
experiments were motivated by a reductionist strategy to focus only on what 
occurs in the head, rather than what happens in the world. Yet as Chemero 
and Heyser correctly pointed out, the lack of concern about the to-be- 
explored objects may prove critical, since different objects afford different 
activities (some can only be touched, whereas others can be climbed unto) 
"leading to potentially qualitatively and quantitatively different exploratory 
behaviors" ([Chemero & Heyser, 2005, p. 410]). Similar limitations can be 
found today in research on childhood play development. Play materials, for 
example, are rarely selected or described with an awareness toward their role 
in actively shaping pretense. This is surprising considering not only that 
research continues to show that different quantities or qualities of toys 
influence play types ([Burns‐Nader et al., 2019; Ban & Uchiyama, 2020]), 
but also that the quality and characteristics of play materials has long been 
a major focus of pedagogical approaches ([Honegger Fresco, 1998]). Some 
studies have attempted to parse out specific aspects of objects that may have 
a greater impact on pretend play, often with contrasting results. For exam­
ple, some studies have investigated the different effects of high structure 
(HS) vs. low structure (LS) play materials. HS materials commonly refer to 
736
L. SPARACI AND S. GALLAGHER

replicas of real-life objects linked to a specific functional use (a toy ham­
mer). While LS materials include natural or human-made objects that do 
not possess in and of themselves a specific function, they lend themselves to 
different uses (a wooden stick). Use of HS vs. LS play materials has been 
shown to effect both quantity and quality of pretend play also in relation to 
child development. For example, in younger children (22-27 months) more 
pretend play seems to be elicited by HS materials, while older children 
(5-year olds) easily incorporate LS materials in their play schemes ([Fein, 
1975; McLoyd, 1983]). As for quality, LS materials seem to elicit better 
pretend play allowing for more flexibility and more object substitution, 
also supporting more changes in play schemes and themes ([Pulaski, 1970; 
Moran et al., 1988; Trawick-Smith et al., 2015; Burns‐Nader et al., 2019]).
Finally, play materials may be used in a specific space and time, which 
may be defined as all those elements which specify or limit play behaviors 
that a child is able and/or willing to produce. In this sense space constrains 
the quantity and quality of a child's play activities. This phenomenon is well 
known to educators in Montessori schools where environments (kitchen 
area, play area, reading area, etc.) are well distinguished and objects pre­
sented to children in each environment are limited in number (in order to 
avoid overstimulation) and type (in each area the child will find objects that 
are closely related to that task space, e.g., the kitchen will contain dishes and 
cutlery, while the playing area may include blocks and puzzles and the 
reading area will provide books) to elicit specific pretend play behaviors 
([Montessori, 1959]). Space is not only to be understood as linked to 
physical elements but also to social ones. For example, a group of little 
girls playing together may leave a specific place when this is occupied by 
children that are not involved in their pretense and return only when the 
original conditions of the setting are restored ([Picchio et al., 2023, p. 70]). 
In fact, social factors may influence the composition of the playground on 
multiple levels ([D. ,Lancy, 2022]). For example, Margaret Mead noted that 
in Samoa toddlers only came into contact with children watched over by 
their caregiver's friends, suggesting that adult peer associations may indir­
ectly structure the playground ([Mead, 1928]).
A second important constraint is the quantity and frequency of play time. 
For example, we have mentioned above that for Yucatec Mayan children 
quantity of time spent in working chores or observing adults for learning 
purposes affects play style. Similarly, the frequency of time bouts allocated 
to a specific play type may influence the emergence of specific play beha­
viors. For example, Picchio et al. (2023) observing child pretend play in early 
childhood and education centers (ECEC) described a group of children 
pretending that an unconventional object is a cake on day 1 and then, 
upon repeating this same play scheme a few days later, returning to the 
same shared meaning without any explicit definition ([Picchio et al., 2023, 
PHILOSOPHICAL PSYCHOLOGY
737

pp. 65-67]). In this case, the repeated frequency of a specific play type seems 
to affect the possibility of building shared meanings that persist in time, thus 
acting as a relevant task constraint.
Taken together, environmental constraints contribute toward delimiting 
a sort of ecological niche that shapes and scaffolds specific pretend scenar­
ios. In his 1935 description of play Griffiths stated how the "five-year-old 
London boy is often an expert with a whip and top, which he can spin in 
a corner of the pavement," while "the Brisbane boy with his greater freedom 
roams in the bush, hunting for bush flowers and learns much about animals 
and birds" underscoring how a particular ecological niche may support one 
or the other form of play ([Griffiths, 1935, p. 324]).
Summing up, environmental constraints - social, cultural, and material - 
play active roles, enabling, guiding, and shaping specific play types. Space 
and time constraints within play contexts may be compared to a diaphragm 
in a film camera: by widening or narrowing the amount of space or time, 
broader or narrower behaviors will be allowed to enter the play scheme. The 
studies mentioned above suggest that pretend play is neither arbitrary nor 
equivalent to real-life states. Rather, although exceptionally flexible and able 
to exploit different scales of abstraction, it is dynamically and consistently 
influenced by social and environmental factors which can be parsed and 
analyzed.
5.3. Task constraints and the Kaleidoscope model
Finally, we will consider task constraints, and, in doing so, we will introduce 
the Kaleidoscope Model to better account for specific characteristics of child 
play.
In Newell's description of motor coordination and control, task con­
straints are distinguished from environmental constraints, which reflect 
the broader ambient conditions. Task constraints are defined as the goals, 
rules, and implements that determine and shape a specific motor action or 
response dynamics ([Newell, 1986]). But we have seen above how disposi­
tional accounts of play highlight that, unlike simple motor acts, child play is 
characterized by intrinsic motivations and attention to means rather than 
goals. As for rules, these are often used by children to "set the stage" for 
a specific play scheme, but may just as quickly be abandoned or completely 
modified in its dynamic enactment. For example, children may say "let's 
play house" or "let's play pirates" referring to specific play scenarios shared 
by a community of peers, but these norms and rules are extremely flexible 
and are often violated or modified to adapt to changes in play schemes. 
When novice players are present children that are better players may self- 
handicap, to ensure that play may proceed and that novices may not be too 
frustrated ([D. ,Lancy, 2022, p. 219]). Some authors refer to "subjective 
738
L. SPARACI AND S. GALLAGHER

worlds" in play, where ordinary social rules concerning people or life in 
general may be violated, mostly with great player enjoyment ([Sutton- 
Smith, 2008]). These rules or norms are largely dependent on mutual 
attention given by children to their respective activities, the reference to 
a common ground of shared experiences and habits, and the active but not 
intrusive, participation of caregivers, who may foster the propagation of 
a play theme ([Picchio et al., 2023]). In other words, in child play rules and 
norms seem to be molded by those same organismic and environmental 
constraints that we have described above, while allowing for a significant 
level of flexibility in how they are actively used to support creativity. 
Similarly, we have seen how social, cultural, and material environments 
may constrain the implementations present in a specific play task space. For 
example, in considering broader cultural differences between North 
American and Taiwanese children we mentioned that the number of toys 
available to children was dependent on available home space, leading to 
differences in play style. But the ways in which these toys may be creatively 
and enactively exploited within a task space are often infinite. For example, 
we have seen that the flexible use of objects and their affordances is a core 
characteristic of pretend play, where a wooden block may become a car, 
a phone, or even a candlestick.
Accordingly, we are led to propose a different definition of task space in 
relation to play types. In particular, we suggest that in play, the task space 
depends on organismic and environmental constraints, while allowing at 
the same time to extend their boundaries through enactive creativity. This 
view urges us to move beyond Newell's original depiction to a multi- 
dimensional representation of how organismic, environmental, and task 
constraints may interact in creating play scenarios. What we propose here 
is a kaleidoscope model.
A simple kaleidoscope is made up of two mirror planes touching along 
a common edge. These planes are placed in a tube with an eyehole at one 
end and a flat box at the other with an outer surface acting as a diffusing 
screen and often containing colored glass or beads. When the diffusing 
screen is illuminated the light passes through the objects inside and is then 
reflected by the two mirror surfaces creating beautiful colorful patterns. The 
number of light reflections is determined by the angle made by the reflective 
surfaces which also changes the number of objects viewed, but the originat­
ing pattern combinations are infinite. Similarly, as we have observed above, 
in play scenarios organismic and environmental constraints may mold and 
delimit a child's play task space, while enactive interactions within play 
allow for ≈infinite creative combinations. Therefore, we can consider orga­
nismic and environmental constraints as two separate reflective planes 
rather than the extremities of a triangle. Metaphorically similar to what 
happens in a kaleidoscope, these two planes touch along a common edge,

such that the angle formed by these planes will determine a play task space, 
while at the same time influencing the number of possibilities or affordances 
available for a specific instance of play [see Figure 2B]. However, the 
combinations supported within this task space will be ≈infinite as a child's 
enactive creative play can create ≈infinite combinations of play scenarios, 
just as a kaleidoscope can produce an infinite number of colorful pattern 
combinations. Furthermore, just as in a kaleidoscope, smaller angles 
between mirrors lead to more refractions, and in play scenarios fewer 
constraints (e.g., unstructured play materials) lead to more flexible task 
spaces. This structure allows organismic and environmental constraints to 
actively shape the task space without limiting a child's creativity.
By proposing this Kaleidoscope Model for play analysis we are attempting 
to fulfill two objectives: on one side we are proposing that the relation 
between an organism and its environment has a direct impact on the task 
space showing how play is both forged and situated in-the-world rather than 
in-the-head, on the other we are implying that play types observed in 
experimental psychology are arranged as a holistic dynamical gestalt 
([Gallagher, 2018]), rather than as a linear set of stages. In line with this, 
we can still think of play as involving different components (with the whole 
being more than the sum of its parts) and we can still use specific planes of 
constraints (organismic, environmental and task related) and their dynamic 
interrelation to analyze and understand the emergence of specific play types 
in childhood.
6. Conclusions: playing-in-the-world as a new road map for 
experimental research
Summing up, we have shown how organism, environmental, and task 
constraints may suggest a shift from current internal, intellectualist, or 
anthropologically narrow definitions of play types toward considering 
how child play is a relationally constructed skill occurring in-the-world 
and actively shaped by multiple dynamic relations. Our intent was to 
propose a new way of observing child play that would avoid the tendency 
to explain it exclusively in terms of children's symbolic or non-observable 
inner states. In doing so, we have also outlined how the different constraints 
(organismic, environmental, and task related) entertain a dynamical rela­
tion. In particular, we have seen above how specific organismic and/or 
environmental constraints may impact the play task space without limiting 
its creativity.
In proposing the Kaleidoscope Model we do not wish to imply that 
a child playing is an empty puppet simply moved by external constraints. 
To the contrary, it is important to stress that, as Brian Sutton-Smith 
suggests, "what may be most important in all this is the benefit play 
740
L. SPARACI AND S. GALLAGHER

affords each child, who gains confidence in a variety of these play 
pretense forms and therefore develops an inner, subjective life, a life 
that becomes the child's own relatively private possession" ([Sutton- 
Smith, 2008, p. 118]). The organism-environment-task dynamics are 
what drive the experiential and cognitive processes which can loop 
back into the play process. Accordingly, the individual and subjective 
experiences, which contribute to the richness of play, are not something 
artificially initiated or constructed in a child's head, but are rather 
actively co-constituted in a space of possibilities, opportunities, and 
constraints that involve the body, others, the environment, and play 
itself.
By stressing the importance of multiple constraints, we propose 
a revised approach to defining play types in developmental psychol­
ogy, fostering attention to elements that have often been overlooked 
by the current literature. We hope that the Kaleidoscope Model for 
play analysis will suggest to researchers on child play a new way of 
looking at play types as child-world interactions in which multiple 
constraints constantly re-arrange themselves to form new, colorful, 
and creative patterns.
Notes
1. For example, games-with-rules, characterized by competition and established 
rules, have goals internal to the game itself (Piaget, 1962). Such as the rules 
that define when an opponent is "caught" in a game of tag. These rules are 
often derived, negotiated, or built on previous forms of play (Pellegrini, 1989). 
Some may argue that by winning a game-with-rules, a child may also achieve 
an external goal, e.g., obtaining social recognition from his peers for being 
a good "catcher" in tag. But this is an indirect goal not linked to the rules of 
the game in itself.
2. Pretend play is also known as representational, symbolic, make-believe, imaginative, 
socio-dramatic, or thematic play ([Feitelson, 1977]). We will use pretend play in the 
following paragraphs as a label for this play type.
3. Organismic constraints included both structural (body weight, height, shape), func­
tional (synaptic connections), and biomechanical constraints (changes in the move­
ment of inertia of each body segment due to body growth); environmental constraints 
were generally external to the individual (gravity, temperature, light); while task 
constraints were determined by the activity (task goals, rules, and implements speci­
fying or constraining response dynamics) ([Newell, 1986, pp. 348-356]). Newell notes 
the fuzziness of the distinction between environmental and task constraints, taking 
the former as more general constraints, and the latter as more specific environmental 
features.
