ABSTRACT
Ecological and enactive approaches to embodied cognition endorse a concept of constitution that 
involves dynamical causality. I argue that this is a challenge for new mechanistic accounts which 
hold to a strict distinction between causality and constitution.

Causality; constitution; 
dynamical processes
Mougenot & Matheson (M&M) present a strong argu­
ment for the relevance of new mechanist explanations 
for an embodied cognitive neuroscience. This seems like 
a productive strategy, especially if they can clarify and 
resolve some tensions associated with new mechanist 
analysis. I will focus on one tension - the one between 
mereology - an explanation in terms of parts and whole, 
where the parts are compositionally constitutive of the 
phenomenon that is being explained - and etiology - 
where the relations that do the explanatory work are 
causal relations. In new mechanist theory, these two 
parts of the theoretical picture do not mix; they are 
separated by a strict distinction between constitution 
and causality, although methodologically the distinction 
tends to disappear. Craver (2007), for example, makes it 
clear that causality is confined to intra-level processes - 
parts on one level are causally related to one another. 
Causality does not cross levels, i.e., between the level of 
parts (or partial processes) and the level of the phenom­
enon constituted by those parts. Constitution involves 
mereological relations - parts compose the whole, and 
they do not cause the whole. As M&M explain, 'a car's 
wheels don't cause a car and its performance but rather 
are understood as partially constitutive of what a car is 
and how it performs' (p. [4]). Causality requires diachro­
nicity; constitution of the mereological sort requires syn­
chronic composition.
Two issues make the distinction relevant to any expla­
natory formulation. The first concerns methodology. It 
pertains to what M&M consistently call 'intervention' or 
'interference' as a test. What precisely does an interven­
tion test for - causal relations or constitutive relations? 
Craver (2007) suggests that his method of 'mutual 
manipulability' is based on James Woodward's (2003) 
notion of interventionist testing and tests for constitu­
tive relations. If through the manipulation of some part 
or process one alters the whole (phenomenon), then one 
knows that this process is a working part that contri­
butes to the constitution of that phenomenon. Thus, 
M&M write: 'For instance, we should be able to interfere 
with a part and this interference should alter the phe­
nomenon of interest (e.g., altering premotor cortical 
activity should affect word recognition' (p. [2]). 
Likewise, if one interferes with the whole (disrupting 
word recognition in some way), it should disrupt activa­
tion in the premotor cortex in some way. In this two-way, 
mutual manipulation, according to Craver, one is testing 
an interlevel (part-whole, mereological) relation of con­
stitution. This suggests that activation in the motor cor­
tex is a compositional part of word recognition. The 
problem is that Woodward's notion of intervention was 
intended to define causal relations. Interventionist caus­
ality would rather lead us to say that activation in the 
motor cortex causally contributes to the process of word 
recognition. For the new mechanists, however, that 
would violate the ban on interlevel causality and lead 
to a causal-constitution fallacy (Adams & Aizawa, 2019).
The second issue is that interventionist methodol­
ogy makes a lot of sense if we take it to be a test of 
causal relations, as Woodward intended. In this 
respect, one needs to think about the nature of 
causality. If we think of it in a traditional linear way, 
then 'A causes B' means that A is necessarily diachro­
nically earlier than B, and causality does not go from 
B to A because time is not reversible. On the other 
hand, some versions of embodied cognition think of 
causality in dynamical, non-linear terms where the 
whole, once formed, or in the process of formation,

can recursively alter the processes that are causing it. 
The meaning that emerges in a developing conversa­
tion, for example, can change an interlocutor's utter­
ances, gestures, facial expressions, neural processes, 
etc. - i.e., just those processes that contribute to 
making the conversation and the meaning what it 
is. In this respect, causality, understood as dynamical 
causality (Gallagher, 2024), is constitutive of the phe­
nomenon, and in heretical mechanist terms, causality 
would involve interlevel processes. For some new 
mechanists one can make sense of this by introdu­
cing (realistically) diachronicity into the constitutional 
relation (understood as a process), relaxing the mer­
eological assumption of synchrony, and allowing cau­
sal interaction accross different levels (Kirchhoff,  
2017; Krickel, 2017). Some theorists might refer to 
this as circular or reciprocal causality, but it should 
be considered more dynamical than that.
To the extent that embodied cognition endorses 
something like dynamical constitutive causality, it 
comes into conflict with a strict new mechanist 
view. One other tension pertains to whether relevant 
explanations require the hierarchical mosaic of differ­
ent mechanistic levels (as Craver, 2007 characterizes 
it) or is better modeled as a dynamical level-free 
mechanism similar to a kaleidoscope (Sparaci & 
Gallagher, 2023). On the latter view, one can elimi­
nate the need to delineate different levels (see 
Woodward, 2020) and simply treat the mechanism 
as a complex set of interacting causal factors (includ­
ing, for example, neural, social, and normative fac­
tors) 
operating 
to 
form 
a 
dynamical 
gestalt 
(Gallagher, 2024).
