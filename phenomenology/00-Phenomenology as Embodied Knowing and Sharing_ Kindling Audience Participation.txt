Phenomenology as Embodied Knowing and Sharing: Kindling Audience 
Participation 
 
 
by Kathleen Galvin and Les Todres 
 
 
Abstract 
 
We are particularly interested in how poetry and phenomenological research come together to 
increase understanding of human phenomena. We are further interested in how these more 
aesthetic possibilities of understanding can occur within a community context, that is the 
possibility of a process in which understanding is shared through an ongoing process of 
participation. In this way phenomenologically-oriented understandings may meaningfully speak of 
that which is common between us as well as that which may be uniquely lived for each of us in 
terms of its individual context and nuance. In this paper we reflect on a process by which we 
engaged with participants to poetically re-present a description of an experiential phenomenon. 
As part of this process we offered an evocative description of a health care scenario, and 
facilitated collectively created 'embodied responses' inspired by the interactive form of Japanese 
Renga. We ask the question: "What kind of phenomenology is this?" Through so doing we attempt 
to address the theme of this special issue, namely, a focus on a wide embrace of the notion of 
evidence. We do this by drawing out the epistemological implications of a phenomenological 
approach that attends to the 'awakening of presences' in embodied and linguistic ways. In this 
pursuit we are assisted by the writings of Gendlin, Gadamer, Levinas and Shotter.  
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
In this paper we offer a consideration of a kind of 
knowing (embodied or palpable knowing) that we 
believe is particularly relevant to a phenomenological 
project. We also offer a reflection on how this kind of 
knowing could be shared within communities and 
audiences so that understanding can move among us 
in meaningful ways. In order to achieve this we draw 
on a philosophical foundation that includes Gadamer, 
Gendlin and Levinas. We then explore what we mean 
by community participation, and share one possible 
approach to this challenge. We outline what happened 
when we explored a process of participative and co-
operative poetry writing (Renga) in response to a 
phenomenologically described situation. We then 
reflect further on the challenge of 'awakening 
presences' in phenomenology with reference to the 
work of John Shotter. Finally, we reflect on some of 
the epistemological and ethical implications of this 
process and the expanded view of evidence that this 
implies.  
 
Renga is defined as a Japanese form of poetry written 
by two or more collaborators with sequential steps:

This Renga portrays something of the spirit of what 
we want to offer, which has to do with two concerns: 
Knowing and sharing. 
 
The history of philosophy is full of solitary thinkers, 
mostly lone men. The muse was in the background, 
often cast ambivalently as creative and demandingly 
possessing. In this paper we ask whether it is possible 
that scholarly life is ready for creative contributions 
from partnerships in mutual dialogue. We also 
question the extent to which there is value in the 
pursuit of dialogical knowing in a community 
context. This paper offers one meditation and one 
practice informed by the phenomenon of embodied 
knowing and 
shared understanding. Embodied 
knowing and shared understanding are particularly 
important in our own disciplinary context of health 
and social care. In health and social care the capacity 
to care rests on an empathic imagination full of bodily 
and relational resonance (Galvin & Todres, 2010). It 
is these bodily and relational forms of understanding 
that are crucial in guiding humanly sensitive practice. 
The term 'presences' may be particularly relevant 
when considering a wider view of evidence within 
this context:   
 
Presence:  An intangible spirit or mysterious 
influence felt to be present (Webster's 
Dictionary, 2008).  
 
One possible direction for phenomenology could be a 
project that leans towards the awakening of 
presences. This leads to questions concerning the 
ways in which this notion of awakening presences is 
different from that of knowing presences. This paper 
thus 
offers 
a 
meditation 
on 
the 
nature 
of 
understanding 
in 
an 
embodied, 
shared 
and 
participatory context. 
 
Knowing 
 
There is a particular kind of knowing that is central to 
the task of authentic caring in health and social care. 
We have characterised this kind of knowing as 
embodied relational understanding (Todres, 2008). 
The importance of such a concern is that it 
emphasises a 'knowing with the heart', in which we 
can imagine another's world. It is only with such 
imagining of another's world that caring 'can have 
legs'. 
 
Sharing  
 
There is another concern that is central to 
understanding, namely the phenomenon of sharing 
and how this can come about within the context of 
community life. To quote Wallulis (1997): 
 
Members of the modern community no longer 
exhibit the openness of dialogue, but rather 
adjust to such technical organisation of life as 
existing beyond their understanding and 
control. (p. 275) 
 
We have therefore become much more interested in 
how embodied relational understanding can be 
shared, and more, carried forward and to some degree 
lived and owned between us in meaningful ways. We 
are interested in how others (for example, audiences, 
readers, group members in learning) can participate in 
a process of shared understanding through which the 
link between understandings and presences is 
awakened, so that understandings of phenomena can 
be deepened and meaningfully shared between us. 
 
Philosophical foundation 
 
Philosophically we have drawn on the work of 
Gadamer (1975), Gendlin (1992) and Levinas (1961) 
to characterise two very important dimensions of 
embodied relational understanding. From Gendlin's 
(1992) work we have drawn on the importance of 
one's embodied self, which gives a meaningful 
reference to 'owning' understanding, so that the 
understanding becomes full of personal, historical, 
and tactile references. In line with this emphasis it is 
only the 'epistemic body' that is adequate for 
gathering together the whole sense of something in a 
felt way. This 'whole sense of something' is never a 
'frozen' or finished whole, but is open, an alive 
presence that is always on the way. From the work of 
Levinas (1961) we have taken the importance of 
being open to the other, and all the meanings there, 
including what it takes to be deeply informed by 'the 
that' of the other's alterity or difference that is always 
more than we can know, thus stretching us to 
horizons beyond ourselves. Gadamer (1975) helps us 
to see what understanding is: A play between 
embodied self and other. In such a play or open 
dialogue there is a care for the presencing of the 
phenomenon, such as, 'the loss', 'the comfort', 'the 
shimmer', that will always be more than just you and 
me; it is always 'that'. 'That' is always more specific 
and more complex than any generalisation.  
 
Together Gendlin (1992), Levinas (1961) and 
Gadamer (1975) have challenged us to engage in the 
kinds of understandings and communications that can 
respect the full spectrum of self, other and world 
without fully reducing one to the other. Therefore, in 
'embodied relational understanding' we find a tension 
between 
our 
shared 
vulnerable 
heritage 
(our 
embodiment), the infinity of otherness (alterity) and 
the alive 'more' of the phenomenon that wants to 
announce itself.

This challenges us with the question of what kinds of 
discourse are adequate in keeping this 'alive' tension, 
contained in embodied relational understanding. We 
see poetry and poetic discourse as a medium that can 
swim in this space between sharedness, otherness and 
the quality of 'just this thing' (the loss, the comfort, 
the shimmer).  
 
In the context of seeking the spirit of the participative 
creative process we also wish to consider the  task of 
what Gendlin (2004) has called 'Carrying Forward', 
in his philosophy of implicit entry. Within this 
perspective, 'carrying forward' is a crucial part of 
what happens qualitatively in the space where shared 
meaning is transmitted and evolves between us. This 
communicative space is more than just me and you in 
an embodied way, it also includes our cultural, 
historical contexts as well as factors beyond this, our 
domains of possible meanings and horizons that 
transcend all the patterns we have made of them.  
 
In relation to our concern to kindle audience 
participation, we offer a particular type of carrying 
forward; a carrying forward of embodied meanings in 
a way that can 'move' or 'touch' another. From there, 
these embodied meanings can be offered again to 
'touch' another and so on continuously. In this way of 
carrying forward, we are not simply duplicating the 
meanings that are transmitted to us. Instead, we are 
participating in meaning making, through receiving 
something 'old' but also bringing something 'new'. In 
this 'carrying forward' we wish to care for the other 
and what he or she is telling us about 'that'. However, 
we are also, as participants, taking part in how these 
meanings relate to us personally and how they carry a 
certain aliveness 'of that' as they move into the 
future.  
 
This aliveness of the phenomenon, 'the that', occurs 
in the sense that it guides the embodied interaction, 
and the whole process has qualities similar to what 
Gadamer (1975) called 'a conversation'.  Wallulis 
(1975), a scholar of Gadamer, has written about the 
notion of a 'language community' and how 
meaningful conversations are 'grabbed' by the matter 
at hand, in a community context, far beyond the 
individual partners' construction of the,:  
 
This event of conversation is not led by any of 
the partners but rather by the subject matter 
(sache) of the conversation that 'seizes' the 
conversation partners into the process of 
coming to an understanding. (Wallulis, 1997, 
p. 274) 
 
Thus in the process of carrying forward, phenomena 
or 'that', have the characteristics of a kind of presence 
that is alive. It is this presence that also changes in 
some way as we embody it both personally and as a 
community. 
 
A further implication of this kind of carrying forward 
is that it is never a linear or abstract process because it 
is grounded in the rich multiple textures of the 
embodied world. It is these rich multiple textures that 
are far more alive than any thought that represents 
them. Thus,  
 
... there is, for Gendlin a 'carrying forward' of 
the body that has been 'dogmatically hidden' 
by conceptual thought. (Wallulis, 1997, p. 
275)  
 
This presence, although it is carried by words is 
always more than the words. In any 'alive' language 
'the more' stays alive as a reference for this presence 
and continues to act as a source of further words 
between individuals. In this respect Gendlin (1992) 
highlights the crucial role that the body plays in 
nourishing the kind of language that is 'up to the task' 
and 
'alive 
enough' 
for 
embodied 
relational 
understanding. Gendlin (1992) says of carrying 
forward, "It is not only the words but also what we 
want to say to carry the situation forward ... in a 
bodily sensed way" (pp. 102-103, emphasis in the 
original).  
 
In this process there is a creative tension between self, 
other and the 'alive' phenomenon. The tension means 
that no words can ever be the final words. However, 
words can open a space and move us toward a new 
understanding. We engage in this tension in a bodily 
felt way, we are carrying forward by engaging in the 
tension between what is shared and what is other. As 
such, the essence of language is not in its summative 
power, but instead in its opening power. Our 
participative quest is to use language that is able to 
move within this 'open'. Foti (1997) argues that for 
Gendlin language is always tactile and full of 
sedimentated meaning: 
 
Gendlin points out that every use of a word 
has, in fact, a certain metaphoric force 
because, whenever a word is brought to speak, 
its sedimentated meaning and connotation 
intercross with the speakers' sense of the 
context or situation (p. 310, emphasis in 
original). 
  
Within such a tactile sense of bringing something to 
words it is possible to notice that this sense involves 
more than any particular phrases or words that one 
uses. Instead, the tactile sense is a living thing 
(presence or phenomenon) that feeds and sustains the 
meanings. We see poetry as one potential way that 
such presencing can be awakened and sustained. As 
an interactive form of poetry Renga writing offers a

way to engage audience participation. In concrete 
terms, this kind of carrying forward then requires a 
play between an attentiveness to the phenomenon, 
which is given by the other and the community of 
others, and our own sense of being touched bodily, 
and further, making something of the presences that 
have been gifted to us. These understandings resulted 
in our interest in Renga as a possible participative 
process that could address the following practical 
question: How can we kindle embodied and linguistic 
participation in a way that holds sharedness, otherness 
and 'the that', and does so in a way that can move 
within the 'open'? 
 
A participative poetry writing process: Kindling 
audience participation 
 
We are intrigued by the Japanese form of Renga and 
wish to share an audience's participative response to a 
phenomenon. At a symposium in Canada, Kate (the 
first author) engaged the audience in a process of 
writing Renga. The audience consisted of qualitative 
researchers from the discipline of education and 
literary poets. Renga is a Japanese form of shared 
poetry that generated the later form of Haiku 
(Reichhold, 2008). We were interested in exploring 
Renga with this audience but in a modified form. That 
is, we dropped the formal Renga rules (5, 7, 5, 
syllables, seasons, moon and flower) but retained the 
principle of co-operative poetic conversation. The 
rationale for dropping the formal structural rules for 
this exercise was that we wanted to emphasise the 
primacy of embodiment, presencing and relationality 
and what emerged in this process, rather than the 
form itself. 
 
We were particularly interested in relationality and 
'the more' of the phenomenon and there were thus 
some principles that we wanted to retain in the Renga. 
One of these was that each written line was either 
written in relation to the line before or written in 
response to everything that had come before, in other 
words to the phenomenon as a whole experience. A 
further emphasis was on the creative tension or play 
between 'the that' of what was offered, and 
participants' bodily felt resonance and unique 
variations in response. 
 
Kate invited symposium participants to respond to an 
initial description of a situation that she as a nurse had 
often experienced, helping someone with faecal 
incontinence. She asked participants to respond to this 
description with 
  
• 
words about their own bodily felt sense; and  
• 
words about the phenomenon that they 
wished to offer. 
 
Participants were invited to contribute to a Renga 
writing process. Once the first line had been written 
participants were invited to write the next line of the 
Renga, after which the group would pause for 
everybody to incorporate that line into their own 
experience and understanding and then move forward. 
At each line we waited for someone to volunteer to 
write the next line and to read it out aloud. Each line 
was free form (with no formal Renga rules). 
 
The following scenario was used as the initial prompt 
for 'kindling' the Renga participative writing process. 
 
The scenario is faecal incontinence. A man of 
45 is laid on his back in a hospital bed on an 
open ward with seven other patients. It is the 
middle of the day and meals are about to be 
served. He is lying in his faeces and he is in 
pain. He cannot move and is aware of the 
stench of his faeces and the presence of other 
patients. He has been like this for five minutes 
but he knows the nurse is on his way; he has 
gone to get a bowl, cloths and water. The man 
feels a degree of self-disgust, even self-
loathing; an overpowering anxiety, a deep 
worry that everyone around is also extremely 
averse to this situation and is bearing this 
smell resentfully. He wants to be invisible, not 
noticed. (Galvin & Todres, 2009, p. 3) 
 
After reading out this evocative descriptive, there was 
long pause. A woman then got up, went to the board 
and wrote: 
 
It is human, this shitting thing 
 
From that moment a series of participants contributed 
lines, each pausing after focusing on the previous 
audience member's contribution. The Renga that 
emerged through participation was as follows:   
 
It is human, this shitting thing 
Discomfort can cause joking: release anxiety 
leaving my body, his body, our body 
Where are you? 
To embrace is (un)certain 
contamination 
heart beat in my ear drums 
I can't stand my body being the last man 
standing 
How have I become (un)dignified? 
This is no fucking good 
Why? Fuck! 
To lose control is to k(no)w shame 
Why are others bodily limits acceptable and 
ours are not? 
 
There was time at the end of the symposium for 
discussion of the whole process and the meaning that

it had for the participants. In addition to further 
sharing and descriptions of individual variations of 
the experience there was also acknowledgement of 
the power of the experience in its palpability and the 
way in which the presence of the phenomenon was 
bigger than any words could say. In this way the 
meanings were not as much in the words as in the 
palpable presence of something almost in the room. 
This process was with a group that were not nurses. 
However, the participants expressed appreciation of 
how important this kind of sharing of meaning could 
be in educating nurses to understand and engage in 
more empathic and humanised ways. One participant 
commented that he felt a 'noema' was in the room. 
Thus we return to the issue at hand: Knowing and 
sharing.  
 
The 'that' that moves 
 
A paper by Shotter (2003) entitled 'Real Presences: 
Meaning as living movement in a participatory world' 
has inspired us to think even further about the 
ontological depth of 'sharing'. Shotter (2003) speaks 
of 
the 
emergence 
of 
"dynamically 
unfolding 
structures of activity that we all participate in 
'shaping', but to which we all must also be responsive 
in giving shape to our own actions"( p. 435). In his 
articulation of the nature of 'real presences' as an 
alternative to 'mental representations', Shotter (2003) 
indicates to us how what is shared in sharing 
meanings is potentially much more palpable and 
complex than an interpersonal process in which one 
person simply conveys meaning to another. Instead, 
in shared meanings there is a third thing, and in a 
sense this thing has its own body. More than this it 
also has life in that it moves and changes beyond the 
participants. Its reality is neither dependent on 
construction by the actors present, nor is it completely 
independent of the actors present. Thus, 'that' and we 
move together, interdependently. For Shotter (2003) 
real presences are "incarnate in the unfolding activity 
in which we ourselves are participants" (p. 461). At 
the same time these real presences "can like another 
person issuing instructions and commands, exert a 
communicative influence on us and thus (at least 
partially) structure our actions" (p. 462).  
 
We believe that our process of kindling audience 
participation through Renga is one way in which 
meanings as moving presences (the 'that' that moves) 
can potentially inform the possibility of shared and 
palpable embodied relational understanding. It is this 
embodied relational understanding that may be 
particularly important to caring practices in our case, 
and beyond this to the epistemological and 
methodological movements that are trying to heal any 
theory/practice gap. Phenomenology, in its quest to 
access lived meanings in a meaningful way, may 
benefit from more consideration of how presences 
become more alive as we attend to them, not only 
with linguistic hospitality, but with bodily hospitality 
as well.  
 
Evocative Kindling or Provocation? 
 
Further to this, we have been reflecting upon the 
process that we have used in our attempt to 'kindle' 
audience participation as one way in which to offer a 
possibility 
of 
shared 
and 
palpable 
embodied 
understanding. After the symposium event described 
above, Kate returned to the UK and we reviewed 
together the value of the process and its potential to 
'awaken presences' in the ways that we have been 
exploring. We wondered whether the process was 
successful simply because of the nature of this 
audience; that is, the audience members had a shared 
and common interest in literary and poetic expression. 
We wondered whether this contributed to a tacit 
openness and agreement to receptively engage in this 
process. This participatory audience took the whole 
process 'in its stride' and simply experienced the 
Renga writing and its outcomes as productively 
challenging and evocative.  
 
With these thoughts in mind we wondered what the 
response would be if we were to present their Renga 
at a conference of human science researchers 
(IHSRC, 2010). In this instance we did not engage 
this new audience in a participative process but rather 
explored with them whether and in what sense the 
presentation of the Renga could awaken a presence of 
the phenomenon in an evocatively productive way 
within this context.   
 
The participative process   
 
We engaged in this process because we were 
interested in the question: Can the thing that 'grabs' 
or touches one audience be shared with another 
audience? Our purpose was to reflect on the nature of 
this sharing and what we may learn about 'a feeling 
of understanding' (Halling, 2008; Todres, 1998; 
Willis, 2004). The feedback that we received from 
this next presentation was mixed. Some participants 
expressed that they had been 'part of an experience', 
in other words, a palpable presence was offered and 
welcomed. For others, the presentation was unsettling 
and even overwhelming. It is in relation to this latter 
response that we became thoughtful and wondered 
about the differences between evocation and 
provocation.  
 
It was not our  primary intention to provoke, upset or 
disgust people, but rather to share something that had 
enough 'felt' or sensual intensity so that it might 
'grab' participants and offer the possibility of an 
embodied response that could perhaps be palpably 
present in the room. In other words, our intention was 
to try out a process with potential to offer embodied

shared participation and to see what happened. 
Embodied shared participation has a 'felt' intensity 
that was, in our view, more likely to be made possible 
by bringing 'right up close' our human connectedness 
through the body's levelling power. This was our 
rationale for choosing the particular humiliation 
scenario as a stimulus for the Renga. However, while 
'kindling' refers to awakening a spark, it is also 'a 
playing with fire'. The process is necessarily 
unpredictable and the potentially powerful nature of 
what may emerge can underwhelm, overwhelm, or 
even provoke our audience. There may also be an 
unpredictable emotional response to what is shared. 
Our intention is to evoke a feeling of understanding, 
but we tread a fine line because we are drawing on 
material 
about 
deeply 
personal 
and 
private 
vulnerabilities, which are usually hidden in practice 
(Lawler, 1997) and may be experienced as a horror. 
There is a reason why we took this risk with our 
audience and now with our readers, and it has to do 
with our project, which concerns the 'humanisation of 
care', suffering and well-being. We aim to call 
practitioners' attentions back to human vulnerabilities 
and existential issues in healthcare (Galvin & Todres 
2010; Todres & Galvin 2010; Todres, Galvin, & 
Holloway, 2009). We believe that this task requires 
some way of confronting our health professional 
audiences with language that does not deny the body 
and its repelling hidden aspects. By doing this we are 
willing to risk the natural reaction of people 'turning 
away' (Kristeva, 1991, 1997) precisely because the 
context of ever increasing technology in caring 
practice moves practitioners further and further away 
from the intensity of vulnerability and suffering that 
people 'on the receiving end of care' often 
experience. Such human vulnerabilities, where 
patients may be 'existentially exiled', are part of 
everyday practice. It is possible that experienced 
practitioners may 'take for granted' or even be 
'hardened to' their patients' 'exile'.  
 
Such 'hardening', which is unfortunately visible in 
health and social contexts, may thus require a 
pedagogical 
approach 
in 
which 
'conventional 
evidence' is not enough to underpin humanly 
sensitive care. It is in this context that our 
pedagogical approach may benefit from evocation 
and sometimes even provocation (Willis & Borbasi, 
2010). It is our aim to bring embodied experience into 
the foreground as a pedagogic project in order to help 
our students remain awake to that which brought 
them into caring in the first place; that is, a care for 
humans. These students may also be faced by the 
challenge of how to develop their capacities to know 
when to be open and when to be more distant in 
caring practice. In other words, they are called upon 
to develop capacities that can mediate the horror 
experienced by themselves and their patients, but to 
do this in such a way that does not add to the 
suffering of the patient (Galvin & Todres, 2009). We 
argue 
that 
bearing 
witness 
(Churchill, 
2005; 
Glassman, 1998) to the experience of the other is a 
fundamental part of caring work, and this is also the 
source for a particular kind of knowledge that can 
guide practice.  
 
Our responsibility to 'keep it safe' 
 
The most that we can do is to make what we are 
going to do explicit to audiences and participants, to 
indicate in advance the nature of the experiences we 
draw on and then to grant the freedom and respect 
that is needed for our audience to allow whatever is 
going to happen to happen. Informed consent is not a 
fluid enough notion to be able to embrace the 
complexities 
of 
a 
possible 
shared 
embodied 
understanding or the unpredictability of the spectrum 
of possibilities between evocation and provocation in 
our process. If we are to be faithful to a 
phenomenological endeavour then we might need to 
take risks with uncertain processes so that fresh 
insights and felt understandings may come from 
immediate experiences in the world. However, it may 
be useful in 'classroom' situations to offer debriefings 
and support, although this is not possible for our 
readerships and some other audiences. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The central question that our paper may raise for 
phenomenology's projects is this: Is one possible 
direction for phenomenology a move towards the 
awakening and sharing of presences? We would like 
to argue that the central spirit of phenomenology 
involves proceeding on the basis of an epistemology 
where understanding is never simply cognitive, but is 
always intertwined with senses, moods, qualities and 
multiple inter-subjective and cultural contexts that are 
given to consciousness in the ways they are 
holistically 
presented. 
Being 
present 
in 
this 
phenomenological way is thus never only 'cognitive 
presence' or 'aesthetic presence' or 'emotional 
presence'. We derive these specialised presences, we 
do not originally live in these presences. The 
importance of this for the theme of this special 
edition, namely a wide embrace of the notion of 
evidence, is that phenomenology in the way we have 
been pursuing it in this paper as the 'awakening and 
sharing' of presences, calls for a definition of 
evidence that is not merely in the third person but is 
also intimate with the first and second person. 
 
It is in this spirit that phenomenology, in giving 
holistic epistemological power, keeps open an 
aesthetic sensibility that precedes the specialisation 
that splits science from art. In Willis's (2004) words, 
we should make "living texts ... and other artistic 
forms to create a portrayal which carries the 
immediacy and impact of an experience" (p. 8). In

addition, a phenomenologically oriented exploration 
of 'what is in the space' between reader and text 
might also allow future projects that explore how 
literature and poetry work (Howard, 2010) in 
facilitating embodied experience and understandings. 
To return to the beginning of our paper, in all of this 
is the lived body, you and I, and even the muse 
beyond our control. It is within this endeavour that we 
see Leggo (2009) referring to his writing as "seeking 
always a living ecology in the vast mystery of the 
earth" (p. 151). From a phenomenological point of 
view this living ecology is a living community. A 
phenomenological project that wishes to address the 
deeply participative nature of this living community 
involves a phenomenology that is faithful to the 
ongoing play between individuality and what is 
shared. This play can never be summarised as 
'evidence' because it is always ongoing and always 
exceeding its last generalisation. Thus, the presence 
moves. We can ask ourselves what kind of 
phenomenology this is. The direction taken in this 
paper is one example of a phenomenological project 
that wishes to: 
 
1) open up authorship in participative ways; 
and 
2) engage in more aesthetic ways of knowing  
3) while still honouring the relational realities 
of presences.  
 
While postmodern relativism engages in the first two 
projects in interesting ways, the phenomenological 
project that we have been exploring also crucially 
retains the third characteristic; that is, an honouring of 
the relational realities of presences.

About the Authors 
  
While nursing, Kate undertook a doctoral study concerning the evaluation of nurse-led 
practice using conventional research methods. Ironically, this drew her towards qualitative 
approaches and reminded her of her formative literary-rich education in Ireland and what had 
been lost in her specialized nurse education: a 'nourished' scholarship that incorporated the 
literary traditions, story, poetry and reflections on experiential meaning. 
 
Observations in clinical practice at that time sensitised her to the reductionist nature of 
practice in contrast to the depth and detail of what people go through in suffering and in 
illness. Kate came to realise that knowing what to do in practice as a nurse didn't always come directly from a 
technical perspective; rather it came from somewhere deeper and she became fascinated with this 'deeper' could 
mean. This led to conversations with colleagues about existential issues and phenomenology, and to the work of the 
human science community. 
 
The world of phenomenology opened a path to the fullness of her earlier experiences, and how poetry and written 
language are able to convey something richer than science and which is palpably present. This journey culminated in 
the development, with Swedish colleagues, of a lifeworld led approach to education which, later, was used by Kate 
when leading two innovative curricula developments at Bournemouth University: a professional doctorate and a set 
of lifeworld-led undergraduate education materials. 
 
Kate has been pursuing interests in phenomenological research, existential philosophy, and poetry in a number of 
concerns in Health and Social Care, particularly regarding the meaning of 'what it means to care'. With Les Todres, 
she has written papers on the humanisation of care, a more contemplative approach to education for caring practices, 
and a developing theory of well-being. This work is to be published (2012) in a book called 'Caring and Well-being: 
A Lifeworld-led Approach'. 
 
Kate is currently Professor of Nursing Practice at Faculty of Health and Social Care, University of Hull, UK.
