Abstract While economics distinguishes itself from the other social sciences by its
treatment of human action as rational, its notion of rationality is actually based on
a profound skepticism about people's ability to reason. This notion goes back to
Hume, according to whom 'Reason is the slave of the passions'. Hume's belief that
people cannot determine their preferences by reasoning led to the notion of
rationality based on representation: people are rational when they are able to
represent their preferences vividly, accurately gauging their intensity. Starting with
Kant, philosophy moved to an understanding of rationality as valid inference;
cognitive psychologists similarly speak of the superiority of the 'reason-based'
model of choice over the economic 'value-based' one. Economics stayed with
Hume's conception because the latter enabled the mathematical expression of a
relation between scarcities. If it is to produce empirically adequate theories
however, economics must follow the examples of philosophy and psychology.

1 INTRODUCTION
One di¤culty of a rhetorical nature faced by unorthodox economists involves
the neoclassical appropriation of the notion of rationality. People rarely
exhibit the rationality of homo economicus, but when a realistically-inclined
economist points this out, he is accused of believing that people are 'irrational'
- a position few people would like to be placed in - especially economists. This
problem has persisted, because unorthodox economists have tended to accept
neoclassicism's notion of rationality. For example, in introducing  rst his
notion of bounded rationality, and then his distinction between the sub-
stantive rationality studied by economics and the procedural rationality
studied by psychology, even Herbert Simon seemed to admit, by the termino-
logy he chose, that the neoclassical notion captures the full, most desirable
kind of rationality (Simon 1972, 1976). More recently, Tony Lawson has
introduced his notion of situated rationality, which can serve as the basis of a
critique of the mainstream notion, by indicating how people can only be
rational in reality as opposed to in theory by their practices being embedded in
the larger set of practices constituted by people's social environment (Lawson
1997). Despite its virtue of pragmatically grounding rationality, this notion

too does not confront the mainstream notion head-on: here too, rhetorically
at least, the claim is that the mainstream notion attributes too much
rationality to individuals; the reasonableness of the notion as an ideal of
rationality is not directly scrutinized.1
One of the most promising alternatives that have been proposed to the
mainstream concept of rationality as a general category for analyzing the
economy is the 'old' institutional economics' concepts of habits and rules. In
this tradition, the key ideas of which have recently been outlined by Geo¡rey
Hodgson, 'the explanatory primacy of habit over . . . all-encompassing
conceptions of rational behaviour' is a¤rmed, and indeed, it is argued 'that
even optimization requires the deployment of rules' (Hodgson 1998: 185).
However, even here the notion of a positive and general type of rationality
seems to be not merely explained in terms of 'lower-level' concepts, but also
given up to orthodoxy. Thus, Hodgson approvingly cites 'evolutionary
psychologists' Cosmides and Tooby (1994) who
postulate that the mind is riddled with functionally speci c circuits. This
contrasts with what they describe as the 'Standard Social Science Model',
where the mind harbors general cognitive processes - such as 'reasoning',
'induction', and 'learning' - that are 'context-independent', 'domain-
general', or 'context-free'. They show that this abstract and generalist
view is di¤cult to reconcile with modern evolutionary biology.
(Hodgson 1998: 188)
The possibility that cognition may be rule-based, but that these domain-
speci c rules may still give rise to a global rationality, is evidently not
considered.
We thus  nd two main types of attitude towards rationality in economics.
On the one hand, one has mainstream economists, who view the use of what
Popper (1985) called the 'rationality principle' as central to explanation in
economics, and take rationality to come down essentially to optimization. On
the other hand, unorthodox economists tend to the view that assuming that
people exhibit a full-blown rationality is of limited usefulness for economics,
so that one should explain human behaviour in terms of bounded rationality
or of habits and rules instead. Recently however, there has appeared an
interest in bounded rationality even among orthodox economists. Kreps
(1997) believes that 'a somewhat revolutionary shift in the economic para-
digm has begun', ' rst and foremost' being that
the assumption that economic entities are hyper-rational and hyper-
perspicacious is under renewed attack. . . . Until recently mainstream
economists mostly shrugged their shoulders at . . . attacks [upon this
assumption such as Simon's] and claimed that the alternative was theoret-
ical anarchy - ad hockery run amok. Nowadays we see more measured
attempts to  nd alternatives, and while no widely accepted standard

alternative has emerged (and may never do so), mainstream economists are
increasingly willing to try the alternatives that do arise. In particular, the
study of adaptive learning and behaviour by the individual has been an
area of signi cant activity recently.
(Kreps 1997: 74)
All this raises the hope that economic theory will  nally begin to re ect the
'reasoning abilities of human beings' (Arthur 1991: 353). And indeed, in a
recent monograph making a contribution to the program of bringing Simon's
concept of bounded rationality into mainstream economics, Rubinstein
(1998) states that
I wish to include models in which decision makers make deliberate
decisions by applying procedures that guide their reasoning about
'what' to do, and probably also about 'how' to decide. In contrast,
evolutionary models treat agents as automata, merely responding to
changing environments, without deliberating about their decisions.
(Rubinstein 1998: 2; emphasis in original)
Thus, even some mainstream economists are now willing to acknowledge
that it may be necessary to drop the standard rationality assumption, since it
is only by acknowledging the bounded rationality of human actors that one
can get closer to how such actors actually reason. This makes it a good time to
consider the question of whether the way the issue of rationality has been
posed by both mainstream and unorthodox economists alike is not mis-
conceived. This paper will argue that the rationality principle is of limited
usefulness not simply because human beings, being subject to 'computational
constraints', are boundedly rational: most fundamentally, the rationality
principle is  awed simply because, deriving from outdated philosophical
presuppositions of the British empiricists, it does not correspond to what
actually constitutes human rationality. If that is the case, then modeling
bounded rationality can get no closer to the actual reasoning of human actors
than modeling 'hyper-rationality'. If you do not have a proper understanding
of what human beings are trying to do when they try to be rational (however
successfully or unsuccessfully), and instead model them as being poor at
something they are not actually trying to do, you will not get very far. The way
to better understand human decision making is not to admit that humans are
boundedly rational. It is to recognize that economists are operating with the
wrong rationality concept.
2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL ORIGINS OF THE CONCEPTION
OF RATIONALITY AS OPTIMAL CHOICE
It is well known that economics employs an instrumentalist notion of
rationality: consumers can rationally choose the bundle that best satis es
Rationality as optional choice vs rationality as valid inference
315

their preferences, but they cannot rationally determine the preferences
themselves - these are, to use the oft-repeated phrase, 'taken as given'. It is
perhaps less well known, among social scientists at any rate, that the source of
this instrumentalism is David Hume. Rather than beginning with Hume
however, it is more appropriate to begin with his predecessor, Thomas
Hobbes. This is for three reasons: (1) Hobbes is the  rst philosopher to
express the ambition to explain human behaviour scienti cally, on a mechan-
ical model; (2) Hobbes formulates the determination of human action in terms
of reason and the passions, as does Hume; (3) unlike Hume, Hobbes does not
see reason as always being dominated by the passions, thus showing us that
Hume's instrumentalism is not a necessary component of the original project
to scienti cally explain human action.
Although Hobbes put forward a materialist account of human behaviour
and motivation by trying to relate voluntary action to motion of the body by
means of his concepts of appetite (which he also called desire) and aversion,
once he turns to the individual passions, he presents a rather common-sensical
account, based on introspection. Among the passions that he lists, in addition
to the more obvious ones such as hunger, love, hate, 'desire of o¤ce', and
'desire of riches', are 'desire of good to another', 'magnanimity in the use of
riches', and 'love of persons for society' - which indicates that despite his
famously declaring that the 'state of nature'is one of 'war of all against all', he
does not subscribe to a simple egotistical psychology (Hobbes 1996 [1651]:
Ch. 6). For Hobbes, reason can con ict with the passions but is not out-
matched by them; the passions demand 'immediate grati cation' and reason
takes a long-term view, aiming to achieve as well as possible the goals of self-
interest and self-preservation. In fact, it is because of reason that the 'war of
all against all' takes place: in general, people will try to get along with one
another, but there will be inevitable con icts of interest, in which case reason
will require that individuals take the necessary measures to protect them-
selves. Such measures can include violence, since for reason, no value is higher
than self-preservation. Reason is able to understand the unsatisfactory nature
of such a situation, and therefore devises the idea of Leviathan, according to
which individuals cede their right to take any measures they believe necessary
for their self-protection (which reason grants them in the state of nature) to a
sovereign. It is thus evident that reason plays a central role in Hobbes' system,
and has considerable practical e¤cacy, being capable of improvising as well as
justifying a particular political system. It is thus anything but Hume's 'slave of
the passions'.2
Like Hobbes, David Hume intended to provide a scienti c explanation of
human behaviour, modeled on natural science. However he went about this
more thoroughly than Hobbes. As we just saw, although Hobbes attempted
to link intentional human action to motions of the body, once he had his
doctrine in place, he went on to develop his theory of action essentially within
the con nes of what is now called folk psychology. Not so Hume. Hume's
316
Articles

philosophical works are one sustained e¡ort to refute rationalist philosophy,
which shares our folk understanding that even if we may be swayed by
passions, intentional action is brought about through a process of reason-
ing. Hume's rationalist predecessor Descartes, like Hume himself, articu-
lated an ambitious project to scienti cally understand the world, but
Descartes' dualism allowed this project to be carried out only for the
domain of nature, not that of mind, which operates in its own domain of
reason independently of nature. Hume's project was to make the mind
subject to scienti c explanation by severely restricting the realm, opened
up by Descartes, in which reason plays a role of any importance, so that
mental phenomena could be understood on the model of Newtonian
explanation of the physical realm. Hume introduced 'elementary units',
his impressions and ideas, which we seem aware of in our mental lives, but
which he could treat as analogues to Newtonian point-masses in his
mental theory. He also introduced a principle corresponding roughly to
that of gravitation - association - which governs how one impression or
idea can lead to another. The Newtonian analogy is very clear, complete
with a Newtonian hesitation to speculate upon what mechanism might
underlie the attractive force (Newton's (1934 [1687]: 547) 'I do not feign
hypotheses'):
These are therefore the principles of union or cohesion among our simple
ideas, and in the imagination supply the place of that inseparable
connexion, by which they are united in our memory. Here is a kind of
ATTRACTION, which in the mental world will be found to have as
extraordinary e¡ects as in the natural, and to show itself in as many and as
various forms. Its e¡ects are every where conspicuous; but as to its causes,
they are mostly unknown, and must be resolv'd into original qualities of
human nature, which I pretend not to explain. Nothing is more requisite
for a true philosopher, than to restrain the intemperate desire of searching
into causes.
(Hume 1978 [1740], 12-3; emphasis in original)
In this explanatory framework, thoughts and feelings are the elementary
units, causing one another. As Penelhum (1993) points out, such a form of
explanation gives the mind itself no role to play:
If the never-ending changes in the physical world are to be explained in
terms of the attraction of material particles to one another, there is no
room for the suggestion that the world itself, which merely contains them,
exerts a force of its own. It is just the place where the events being described
occur. Similarly, if the course of my mental history is determined by the
associative attraction of my perceptions, so that they cause one another to
arise, there seems no place, perhaps even no clear sense, to the suggestion
that I, the mind or soul that has them, can exert any in uence over their
Rationality as optional choice vs rationality as valid inference
317

course. All the mind does is include them. The self, or ego, as he says, is just
'a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively make their
appearance'.
(Penelhum 1993: 122)
It is here that we  nd the source of the philosophy of mind underlying
mainstream economics, according to which it is plausible to represent human
agents as potential functions.3
To restrict the signi cance of reason for human action, Hume needed to
counter the common-sense belief, shared by Hobbes, that reason is often
victorious over the passions, and that this is a good thing - as when the hero of
a detective television series saves the life of a criminal who has personally
injured him in the past, for example. Hume did this by making a negative
argument against reason's ability to in uence our behaviour, and a positive
argument showing how cases such as the example just given could be
understood as involving a con ict of passions (Hume 1978 [1740]: book II).
The  rst argument is based upon what has come to be known as Hume's fork,
according to which reason has only two functions: to determine logical
relations, such as those which hold between the propositions of mathematics,
and to determine empirical matters of fact, such as is done in science. It is hard
to see how one function or the other could spur one to action: one must have
an emotional inclination of some kind to be impelled to do something. To be
sure, once one already has such an inclination, then reason in both its
functions can assist one in e¡ectively indulging it - hence Hume's declaration
that 'reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions' (Hume 1978
[1740]: 415). The second argument depends upon Hume's distinction between
the calm and the violent passions - which di¡er in the intensity with which
they are felt - and Hume's observation that '[a]s repeated custom and its own
force have made every thing yield to it, [a passion] directs the actions and
conduct without that opposition and emotion, which so naturally attend
every momentary gust of passion'(p. 419). Thus, a calm passion, if it becomes
entrenched in us by habit, may end up having more in uence over our actions
than a violent passion, and this, according to Hume, is what actually happens
when we think that reason is winning out over passion.
We thus see a high overallconsistency between Hume's philosophy of mind
and his philosophy of action: in the same way that one or more ideas produce
a further idea through a process of attraction, one 'chooses to do the right
thing'despite what one's emotions drive one to do because the intensity of the
passion associated with doing what is morally superior is stronger than that of
the passion associated with doing what is morally inferior. In both cases,
mental phenomena are subsumed under causal processes on the model of
Newtonian mechanics, leaving no scope or function for reason, except a
purely instrumental one.
When one recalls that Pareto (1935: §152), among others, distinguished
economics from sociology by holding that economics studies rational (what
318
Articles

he termed 'logical') behaviour whereas sociology studies human behaviour in
general, it is ironic that economics inherits its notion of rationality from a
philosophical tradition which emphasizes the limitations of reason for
guiding human conduct. This tradition did not enter into economics without
modi cation, however. As it stood, Hume's philosophy of action did not
provide a suitable basis for economic theorizing, since in Hume's framework,
a multitude of passions compete among themselves to provoke action,
without it being necessarily the case that their intensities could be ranked in
any unique way. Economics however requires the existence of a unique metric
which could correspond to the principle that in the market, everything is in
principle exchangeable for everything else. A suitable basis was provided by
Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism.
Bentham unequivocally followed Hume on the point that human action is
determined by the passions, not by reason. Where he di¡ered from Hume was
in holding that all passions in their e¡ects on action could be reduced to two,
one repulsing, and the other enticing:
Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign
masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we
ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand the
standard of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and e¡ects,
are fastened to their throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all
we think: every e¡ort we can make to throw o¡ our subjection, will serve
but to demonstrate and con rm it. In words a man may pretend to abjure
their empire: but in reality he will remain subject to it all the while.
(Bentham 1996 [1798]: Ch. 1)
Bentham's principle of utility merely recognizes this fact of the human
condition (which Bentham seemed to take to be true a priori: the principle
cannot be proved, 'for that which is used to prove every thing else, cannot
itself be proved'). Utility merely represents the degree to which a given mental
state is accompanied by pleasure or pain:4
By utility is meant that property in any object, whereby it tends to produce
bene t, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness, (all this in the present
case comes to the same thing) or (what comes again to the same thing) to
prevent the happening of mischief, pain, evil, or unhappiness to the party
whose interest is considered.
(Bentham 1996 [1798]: Ch. 1)
Since every mental state is accompanied by a unique, determinate level of
utility, all mental states can be compared and ordered. This means that every
decision problem becomes in e¡ect an exercise in maximization. As Hollis and
Sugden (1993) point out, from the standpoint of Hume's philosophy of
action, this universal comparability of mental states is not a requirement of
reason, but merely a posited fact about human psychology:
Rationality as optional choice vs rationality as valid inference
319

If reason is the slave of the passions and if a passion is an original existence,
then it cannot be a requirement of reason that the passions are susceptible to
any particular mathematical representation. If a person's desires do not
have the properties of commensurability or 'consistency' required for
reason to identify a best action, that is too bad for reason. In order to
arrive at a maximizing theory of rational choice, we have to do what
Bentham does: Add a psychological hypothesis about the nature of desires
or pleasures.
(Hollis and Sugden 1993: 5; emphasis in original)
Of course, Bentham's utilitarianism only came to theoretical fruition in
economics with its inevitable mathematization by Jevons and Walras. It is
interesting to note however that Jevons did not believe in a global commen-
surability of pleasures, but - referring to a distinction between 'higher' and
'lower' pleasures introduced by J.S. Mill as a twist on Bentham - argued that
economics could safely con ne its attention to 'the lowest rank of feelings',
which he did hold to be commensurable (Jevons 1957 [1871]: 27). Such
reservations became unnecessary as the theory was gradually divorced from
its psychological underpinnings, while the mathematical structure of utilitar-
ian theory was retained. During this process, the theory became interpreted
not as a model of economizing behaviour in the economy, but of rational
choice tout court (Demeulenaere 1996).
The process was begun in earnest by Pareto, who showed that the current
theory of consumer choice could be derived without introducing any psycho-
logical assumptions about utility, by using Edgeworth's notion of indi¡erence
curves - sets of bundles of goods between which a consumer is indi¡erent.
Since, according to Pareto, the notion of indi¡erence is 'given directly by
experience', while assigning utility indices to given indi¡erence curves is
simply to provide a mathematical representation to the idea that a person
chooses with a given set of preferences, 'the theory of economic science . . .
acquires the rigour of rational mechanics; it deduces its results from
experience, without bringing in any metaphysical entity' Pareto (1971: 391,
113). This program was carried forward by Samuelson's (1947) theory of
revealed preference and extended to choice under uncertainty by von
Neumann and Morgenstern (1947).
Those results were synthesized by Savage (1954) into what is still generally
regarded as the canonical formulation of decision theory. Savage presents his
book as concerned with 'the implications of reasoning for the making of
decisions', and as dealing with these issues by extending logic, 'by principles as
acceptable as those of logic itself, to bear more fully on uncertainty'. Since
Savage is aware that 'formal reasoning presumably plays no role in the
decisions of animals, little in those of children, and less than might be
wished in those of men', he is inclined to make a normative rather than
descriptive interpretation of his theory (p. 6). According to Savage,
320
Articles

[t]he principal value of logic . . . is in connection with its normative
interpretation, that is, as a set of criteria by which to detect, with su¤cient
trouble, any inconsistencies there may be among our beliefs, and to derive
from the beliefs we already hold such new ones as consistency demands.
(Savage 1954: 6)
And analogously, the main use that Savage says he would make of his
theory 'is normative, to police my own decisions for consistency and,
where possible, to make complicated decisions depend on simpler ones'
(p. 20). Savage raises the possible objection that a person might be willing
to take the rules of logic as normatively binding, but not those of decision
theory. To this he replies that if it is pointed out to him that he has
preferences that are inconsistent according to his theory (that he holds
a À b and b À c, but also c À a):
[w]henever I examine such a triple of preferences on my own part, I  nd
that it is not at all di¤cult to reverse one of them. In fact, I  nd on
contemplating the three alleged preferences side by side that at least one
among them is not a preference at all, at any rate not any more.
(Savage 1954: 21)
So whereas for Hume, it was our passions that dictate our preferences to us,
we now  nd that theory can dictate to us when we do or do not have a
preference. Savage does not consider that perhaps the problem lies with the
concept of preference itself. Perhaps as we reason our way to a decision (if not
formally reason - Savage does not consider the distinction), we do so without
constructing the preferences which are in danger of con icting, or if we do
notice preferences that con ict, we just choose anyway, not by resolving the
con ict by recalibrating our preferences so that they no longer con ict, but by
'choosing' which set of con icting preferences to privilege.
As we saw, the reason Hume bestowed supremacy upon the passions - the
philosophical precursors of the preferences of decision theory - was to rule
out the role of reason as the  nal determinant of our actions, that is, to
describe our behaviour as being determined not rationally, but by instinct and
custom. What has happened between Hume and Savage is that the meaning of
rationality itself has shifted, so that rationality is now a matter not of one's
reasoning (or lack thereof), but of the choices one exhibits.
3 EMPIRICIST VERSUS INFERENTIALIST PHILOSOPHY OF
ACTION
Hollis and Sugden (1993) characterize the philosophical origins of rational
choice theory as follows:
Although its origins can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle, the modern
theory stems from the scienti c aspirations of the Enlightenment. It derives
Rationality as optional choice vs rationality as valid inference
321

from the ambitious but con icting attempts at a moral science of mind
made by Hobbes, Hume and Kant, and was then given a mathematical
structure by Bentham and the utilitarians, before being abstracted as an
all-but-formal exercise in what might be termed epistemic logic.
(Hollis and Sugden 1993: 2)
This is an admirably concise and accurate description, with one exception: it
exhibits marked Anglo-Saxon bias as to how one should understand
'scienti c'. Even with Newtonian science in the background, quite a di¡erent
conception of what a 'moral science of mind' should look like was possible
than the one developed by Hobbes and Hume.
To see this, it is necessary to understand that there are two di¡erent ways in
which the order we  nd in the world, which science seeks to describe precisely
and explain, comes about: either through the regularity that the natural world
exhibits as a consequence of its being governed by natural laws, or through the
obligations that intelligent agents feel and respond to as a consequence of
being members of communities with shared norms and practices. John
McDowell has observed that there are:
two kinds of intelligibility: the kind that is sought by (as we call it) natural
science, and the kind we  nd in something when we place it in relation to
other occupants of 'the logical space of reasons', to repeat a suggestive
phrase from Wilfrid Sellars. If we identify nature with what natural science
aims to make comprehensible, we threaten, at least, to empty it of meaning.
By way of compensation, so to speak, we see it as the home of a perhaps
inexhaustible supply of intelligibility of the other kind, the kind we  nd in a
phenomenon when we see it as governed by natural law. It was an
achievement of modern thought when this second kind of intelligibility
was clearly marked o¡ from the  rst.
(McDowell 1994: 70-1)
Hobbes and Hume lived in the period when these two kinds of intelligibility
were becoming marked o¡ from one another, and it seemed to them that the
only way to scienti cally study human action was not within the 'logical space
of reasons' (which was how action was understood not just by common sense
but also by the rationalist philosophers), but as governed by natural law. (As
we saw, Hume was more consistent in carrying out such a project than was
Hobbes.) The results of this 'philosophical hunch' have determined economic
theory ever since. On the face of it, Hume's move might appear reasonable:
how else can one scienti cally study any phenomenon, whether it be natural
or mental, other than to search for the laws that produce and govern it?
The answer to this question was provided by Kant.5 He remarks:
Everything in nature, both in the lifeless and in the living world, takes place
according to rules, although we are not always acquainted with these rules.
- Water falls according to laws of gravity, and with animals locomotion
322
Articles

also takes place according to rules. . . . The whole of nature in general is
really nothing but a connection of appearances according to rules, and
there is no absence of rules anywhere. If we believe we have found such a
thing, then in this case we can only say that we are not acquainted with the
rules.
The exercise of our powers also takes place according to certain rules
that we follow, unconscious of them at  rst, until we gradually arrive at
cognition of them through experiments and lengthy use of our powers,
indeed, until we  nally become so familiar with them that it costs us much
e¡ort to think them in abstracto . . .
Like all our powers, the understanding in particular is bound in its
actions to rules, which we can investigate. Indeed, the understanding is to
be regarded in general as the source and the faculty for thinking rules in
general. For . . . the understanding is the faculty for thinking, i.e. for
bringing the representations of the senses under rules.
(Kant 1992: 527; emphasis in original)
Here Kant is saying that both the natural world and thinking are governed by
rules. (Indeed, in the last sentence, Kant identi es thinking with following
rules.) In the natural world these rules take the form of laws. But in the case of
thought, Kant speaks of 'thinking rules'. Evidently, a stone when it falls to the
ground does not 'think' the law of gravity: it just 'obeys' the law 'mechani-
cally'. When we follow rules however, we do so by thinking them (although as
Kant remarks, we may become so familiar with them that it may be di¤cult
for us to think of them explicitly), so, unlike the case with the stone, there is
some e¡ort or thought involved in our following rules. How is one to
understand the di¡erence between these two types of rule-following?
A way of proceeding is the one Kant himself followed, which is to make use
of a jurisprudential analogy. When we follow a rule, we do not follow it in the
way that a falling stone conforms to the law of gravitation, but in the way a
citizen conforms to the laws of her country: it is not a matter of causal
necessity, but of normative necessity, of obligation. We are aware of the law,
we understand that we are obligated to follow it, and we tend to follow it most
of the time, but we can also fail to follow it, for whatever reason.
Thus, when we think, when we apply concepts - to Kant, a concept is just a
rule - we follow rules, and since we are thinking, we take the rules as rules.
This means that though most of the time we follow our 'rules of thought'
tacitly, since we are aware of them as rules, we can consider them explicitly, to
interpret them and understand how, given that the right conditions are met,
they lead to certain prescribed consequences.6 Thus, most of the time when I
want to point out the presence of a cat, I simply say 'There's a cat', giving the
matter no further thought; if pressed on why I speci cally said those words
however, I would explain that in my 'language community', we use 'cat' to
refer to cats. Since 'cat'is a concept, the word has an inferential role: it must be

usable in formulating premises and conclusions of inferences assessable as
correct or incorrect. This ability to re ect on our practices of rule following is
constitutive of thought, of our sapience as opposed to mere sentience, and one
can argue that it distinguishes us from other higher mammals (Brandom 1994;
Haugeland 1998; Pettit 1993).
Now, given that we are thinking creatures, how does rational choice
theory, and decision theory in particular,  t in with our practices of thought?
Evidently, not well. This is because we are able to determine neither our
preferences nor our estimates of probabilities so precisely as the theory
requires in order for us to choose one commodity bundle or act over another,
but also because the validity of the axioms of decision theory is not
transparent to us (in the way that, say, modus ponens - the rule that if
p ! q and p are both true, then q is true - is evident to us) (Pettit 1993: 239-48).
This should not be surprising. As we have seen, the theory's origins lie in
empiricism. And - to quote Robert Brandom on Sellars' reasons for  nding
empiricism wanting - 'the distinctive nature, contribution, and signi cance of
the conceptual articulation of thought have been slighted by empiricism in all
its forms' (Brandom 2000: 32). Instead of considering how we form our
preferences by reasoning and reason our way to an action on the basis of those
preferences, rational choice theory in e¡ect simply supposes that we can
represent our preferences to ourselves, and that these representings will then
allow us to perceive what our optimal choice would be.7 In this, the theory is
true to its empiricist origins. As Brandom has observed:
The master concept of Enlightenment epistemology and semantics, at least
since Descartes, was representation. Awareness was understood in repre-
sentational terms - whether taking the form of direct awareness of
representings or of indirect awareness of representeds via representations
of them. Typically, speci cally conceptual representations were taken to be
just one kind of representation of which and by means of which we can be
aware. This orienting thought remains active to this day.
(Brandom 2000: 7)
Wilfrid Sellars has called the empiricist framework that takes our sense
impressions (and other representings) for granted and as the raw data upon
which our knowledge is built 'the myth of the given'. By taking our
preferences as given, and then further supposing that they are given in such
a way that they can all be compared to each other, rational choice theory is
based upon a 'double' myth of the given.8 Thus in order to understand what is
wrong with the rational choice framework, we must consider Sellars'
argument.
Sellars' essay 'Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind' (1997 [1956]) is
directed against empiricist foundationalism, that is, against the idea that the
ultimate ground for knowledge lies in sense-impressions, which are 'self-
justifying' since they are 'immediate', that is, bits of knowledge not derived
324
Articles

from other bits of knowledge. The overall argument is fairly complicated and
circuitous, so I will only mention the main points which are directly relevant
to us here. (To see what the argument is directed against, it may be helpful to
think of the myth of the given as the epistemological equivalent of the logical
empiricists' failure to recognize the theory-ladenness of observations.)
According to Sellars, an empiricist is committed to the following triad of
claims:
A.
'S senses red sense content x', entails 'S noninferentially believes (knows)
that x is red'.
B.
The ability to sense sense contents is unacquired.
C.
The capacity to have classi catory beliefs of the form 'x is F ' is acquired.
(Brandom 1997: 129)
Together, these claims seem to do justice to our intuition that our sense
experiences themselves are somehow immediately, noninferentially presented
to us, whereas when we describe our sense experiences, we are engaging in a
kind of reasoning. A is required for sense data to be able to serve as a
foundation for knowledge: if they were known inferentially, then their truth
would depend on something else. B is plausible: this ability seems biological in
nature. C is also plausible: the capacity to make the judgement 'x is F 'involves
classifying particulars under universals, which would seem to require experi-
ence to know what the qualities making something F are. The problem is that
these claims are mutually inconsistent: A and B together entail not-C; B and C
entail not-A; A and C entail not-B. Therefore, one of the claims must be given
up. Giving up B would mean supposing that animals cannot feel hunger and
pain, so B is not an attractive candidate. Giving up C would require giving an
account of what universal concepts are innate and would require that
concepts such as tall and red are innate, which is something few philosophers
would  nd plausible. A is the myth of the given - 'the idea that a sensation of a
red triangle is the very paradigm of empirical knowledge' - and Sellars
proposes to give it up (Sellars 1997 [1956]: §7).
What breaking with A would involve is illustrated by Sellars by means of a
story (1997 [1956]: 14-16). A young man works in a tie store, and routinely
pulls out various ties based on their colour. For example, he may show a tie to
a customer, and say 'Here is a green tie'. According to empiricism, this
sentence is merely a neutral report of 'raw'sense data, with no inference being
involved in the determination that the tie is green. Now, according to the
story, the store is  tted with  uorescent lighting (the essay was written in the
1950s, after all!), and one day when the man pulls out a tie saying it is green,
the customer tells him, 'No it isn't', and takes it outside, upon which it turns
out to be blue. 'That's funny', says the clerk, 'the tie was green, and now it's
blue!''Don't be silly', answers the clerk, 'you know ties don't change color just
like that'. Finally, the clerk comes to understand that the colour that a tie
appears to him can be in uenced by the lighting. In the future, when he sees a
Rationality as optional choice vs rationality as valid inference
325

tie that appears that hue of green to him in the store when the lighting is on, he
describes it as blue. When the lighting is o¡ and there is only daylight in the
store, he describes the tie as green. Now in his practice of describing the colour
of ties, he can justify the validity of his reports, by mentioning the e¡ect of
lighting on perceived colour, pointing out that the electric lighting is o¡ so
that one is observing the tie under 'standard conditions', and so on. All of this
conceptual knowledge is required in order to be able to know that one is seeing
a green tie:
The essential point is that in characterizing an episode or a state as that of
knowing, we are not giving an empirical description of that episode or state;
we are placing it in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and being able
to justify what one says.
(Sellars 1996 [1956]: 36)
Thus, contrary to the empiricist account, making observations of what one
sees is by no means simply a matter of reporting sense data that are obtained
non-inferentially. One must always make inferences when one attempts to
conceptually categorize what one perceives. This completely undermines
empiricist foundationalism, since according to the latter, concepts are
supposed to be derived from sense data, whereas here we see that concepts
are required to (conceptually) experience sense data in the  rst place.9
What are the implications of all this for rational choice theory?We can take
a cue from Brandom here: according to:
prevailing humean ideas about practical reasoning . . . - which [are] very
much in evidence in [Donald] Davidson's writing on action, and of
rational-choice theorists and others who approach the norms of rationality
through decision theory or game theory - the norms governing practical
reasoning and de ning rational action are essentially instrumental norms,
which derive their authority from intrinsically motivating preferences or
desires. Those states are the empiricist analogs, on the side of agency, to the
preconceptual episodes of awareness to which epistemic authority is traced
on the side of cognition.
(Brandom 2000: 30-1)
The very cogency of the rationality concept of rational choice theory is based
on the premise that, whatever reasoning did or did not go into the establish-
ment of an agent's preferences, the preferences themselves are a su¤cient
basis upon which to build a norm of rational action. If we recognize however
that preferences can no more function as self-supporting rational justi ers of
action than experience can at the same time justify itself and serve as a
foundation for empirical knowledge, it becomes clear that this premise cannot
be valid. In evaluating the rationality of an action, one cannot separate the
reasoning involved in the construction of preferences from the rest of the
reasoning involved in the corresponding decision, which rational choice
theorists describe as an optimization. By in e¡ect only commencing their
326
Articles

analysis once preferences exhibiting a consistent global ordering are already
in place, so that which choice is optimal follows tautologously from the
preference ranking, rational choice theorists work with a conception of
decision making in which there is no place for any kind of reasoning.
According to rational choice theorists, for a choice to be rational, two
conditions must be met: there must be a consistent preference ordering, and
the optimal choice must be chosen. The second condition involves reasoning
no more than any other tautology does: to say that 'A table is a table' for
example is not to reason. And as we saw in Section 2, the  rst condition does
not involve reasoning either: as Hollis and Sugden (1993) point out, that there
be a consistent preference ordering is not a requirement of reason, but a
'psychological hypothesis about the nature of desires or pleasures'.
If reasoning in choice involves neither the possession (or construction) of a
preference ordering nor optimization, the economically-minded reader may
wonder what it could possibly involve. The kinds of issues that are involved
will become clearer in the next section, when we consider some psychological
literature. Before we turn to that however, let us try to draw out more
concretely the implications of Strawson's critique of empiricism for how we
should think of the relation of rationality to stable, consistent preferences.
What would be an analog of Strawson's story about the young man  nding
that whether or not a tie is really green depends upon the kind of lighting in the
store? The obvious answer is that in the same way that how we interpret what
we perceive will depend on the environmental conditions under which we  nd
ourselves, how we value outcomes that we consider will depend upon the
context in which we place those outcomes. Tversky and Kahneman (1987)
have developed a famous series of experiments illustrating what is involved,
which they call framing. In one experiment, Tversky and Kahneman found
that medical doctors choose one medical procedure over another if the
procedures are described in terms of how many 'lives' they are likely to
'save', but that the doctors choose the other procedure if the procedures are
described in terms of how many deaths are likely to occur under each.
This behaviour is unquestionably irrational, since the outcomes presented
in the two di¡erent descriptions are objectively precisely the same. Thus the
usual conclusion as to the implications of such experiments is that they
demonstrate that people often exhibit irrationality, but such experiments do
not throw under doubt the prevailing humean empiricist norm of rationality
itself. However, it is not di¤cult to construct examples for which it is hard to
obtain a unique objective valuation, and indeed for which it does not appear
to be the case that such a valuation even exists. Consider a case in which I am
o¡ered a job in a respected institution; if I take the job, it is highly likely I will
have a successful career. Unfortunately, the institution is in a boring,
provincial town, and I know that when I am not forgetting myself in work,
I will be very unhappy. How should I value this job prospect? Abstracting
away from time-horizon considerations, the choice evidently comes down to
Rationality as optional choice vs rationality as valid inference
327

whether I view personal happiness or social success as the more important. If I
frame the prospect in relation to my happiness, it will come out in a negative
light; while if I frame it in relation to success, it will seem attractive. Now why
would one think that a rational person would have a preference for one frame
or the other here, so that he could have well-ordered preferences over actions?
To construct a preference here that would be stable, one would have to
develop a whole 'philosophy of life', so that once one had decided on a
preference, one would have grounds for staying commited to it. (If one did not
develop such a philosophy, then one would prefer at times hapiness and at
other times social success, depending on one's mood, since both are desirable.)
But constructing a personal philosophy of life is a monumental undertaking,
which probably few engage in. So where does that leave us with regards to my
choice situation? I need to make a choice, but have no reason to think that I
can or should construct preferences that would impell me in one direction or
another; yet still I want to think of myself as rational. The only thing I can do
is construct an argument indicating why I should or should not take the job,
go over it until I am satis ed by it, and then stand by it.
What we obtain here is a notion of rationality diametrically opposed to
the empiricist one. It is helpful to consider this in relation to Herbert
Simon's
distinction
between
substantive
and
procedural
rationality.
According to Simon, substantive rationality is a valid and respectable
notion in its own right; furthermore, it is more fundamental than proce-
dural rationality, since we need it to tell if something is procedurally
rational, but not the other way around. The reason we need the notion
of procedural rationality is that people, being cognitively limited, are often
incapable of substantive rationality. What the choice situation just con-
sidered suggests is that in actuality, procedural rationality is more funda-
mental; it is the procedure that makes one rational or irrational. When one
considers the general case, substantive rationality - the empiricist rational-
ity of rational-choice theory - is a chimera; it assumes in e¡ect that there is
always a God's-eye point of view from which alternatives can be objectively
valued, even if our discriminatory apparatus is not so  nely-tuned that we
can be aware of these valuations. The source of the idea that such a God's-
eye point of view is possible, or that it is necessary for scienti cally
understanding human behaviour, is Hume's and Bentham's being under
the sway of a naive interpretation of Newtonian science.
4 VALUE-BASED VERSUS REASON-BASED CHOICE
Thus far, my argumentation has been philosophical, considering the
historical origins of the economic rationality concept and relating the latter
to an understanding of human beings as thinking creatures. For empirically
minded readers, this may lay me open to the charge that I have been engaging
in what psychologists have called 'introspection and a priori analysis (also
328
Articles

known as ''indoor ornithology'')' as opposed to aiming to support my
'theorizing' by means of 'experimental investigations' (Johnson-Laird and
Sha r 1993: 3). I therefore turn now to consider some empirically-oriented
psychological literature on choice that yields a picture of the latter consistent
with the one we have been considering.
Sha r et al. (1993) distinguish between two traditions of the study of
decision making, which they call value-based and reason-based:
In order to explain how people resolve . . . con ict [raised by choice
situations], students of decision making have traditionally employed
either formal models or reason-based analyses. The formal modeling
approach, which is commonly used in economics, management science,
and decision research, typically associates a numerical value with each
alternative, and characterizes choice as maximization of value. Such
value-based accounts include normative models, like expected utility
theory (von Neumann and Morgenstern 1947), as well as descriptive
models, such as prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). An
alternative tradition in the study of decision making, characteristic of
scholarship in history and the law, and typical of political and business
discourse, employs an informal, reason-based analysis. This approach
identi es various reasons and arguments that are purported to enter into
and in uence decision, and explains choice in terms of the balance of
reasons for and against the various alternatives.
(Sha r et al. 1993: 12)
The authors go on to note the attractiveness of viewing choice as being
determined by reasons:
First, a focus on reasons seems closer to the way we normally think and
talk about choices. When facing a di¤cult choice (e.g. between schools, or
jobs) we try to come up with reasons for and against each option - we do
not normally attempt to estimate their overall values. Second, thinking of
choice as guided by reasons provides a natural way to understand the
con ict that characterizes the making of decisions. From the perspective of
reason-based choice, con ict arises when the decision maker has good
reasons for and against each option, or con icting reasons for competing
options. Unlike numerical values, which are easy to compare, con icting
reasons may be hard to reconcile. . . . Finally, a conception of choice based
on reasons may incorporate comparative considerations (such as relative
advantages, or anticipated regret) that typically remain outside the
purview of value maximization.
(Sha r et al. 1993: 13)
I will now go on to summarize the experimental results o¡ered by Sha r et al.
(1993), mentioning why they are anomalous from a value-based perspective
but are to be expected from a reason-based perspective.
Rationality as optional choice vs rationality as valid inference
329

4.1 Choice between equally attractive options
Slovic (1975)  rst asked subjects to  ll in a missing value in one of two
bundles, which have attributes along two dimensions, so that the bundles
appear equally attractive to the subjects. A week later, the same subjects were
asked to choose between the bundles. Obviously, utility theory predicts that
the subjects would be equally likely to choose either of the two alternatives,
since the experiment is set up so that they are equally valued. Eighty-eight per
cent of the subjects, however, chose the bundle that was superior along the
dimension they considered more important. This is what one would expect
from a reason-based perspective, since the subjects had a clear reason to
choose the chosen bundle.10
4.2 Reasons pro and con
If a subject is faced with a binary choice situation, from a value-based
perspective it should not matter whether s/he is asked to select an option or
reject an option: selecting one option is the same as rejecting the other.
However, when Sha r (1993) tested this in an experiment, he found that
subjects were more likely to select an 'enriched' option if asked to select an
option and to reject the same 'enriched' option if asked to reject an option, as
opposed to selecting/rejecting an 'impoverished'option. (The enriched option
was clearly superior to the impoverished option along one dimension, while
also clearly inferior to it along another.) Again, from a reason-based perspect-
ive, this is what one would expect, since subjects could give themselves a
de nite reason to select or reject the same option.
4.3 Choice under con ict: seeking options
Tversky and Sha r (1992a) presented subjects with two di¡erent situations.
Either they were given a choice between two bundles, one of which clearly
dominated the other, or they were given a choice between two bundles, neither
of which was dominant. The experiment was set up so that the best alternative
in the latter situation (the 'con ict' situation) was also available in the
situation in which there was a dominant option. Subjects were asked if they
were willing to stick with the options they were given, or if they would prefer
to be given a new choice. Because the best alternative o¡ered in the dominance
situation is also available in the con ict situation, value-maximization implies
that the percentage of subjects who seek an additional alternative should not
be greater in the con ict situation than in the dominance situation. However,
that is indeed what turns out to happen. This is understandable from a reason-
based perspective: when making a choice, subjects want to have a reason
which justi es it. One is available in the dominance situation but not the
con ict situation. Therefore, in the latter, subjects prefer to have a new set of
options from which to choose.
330
Articles

4.4 Choice under con ict: adding options
A standard assumption in expected utility theory is the principle of independ-
ence of irrelevant alternatives: the preference ordering between two options
should not be altered by the introduction of additional alternatives. However,
the authors relate the following anecdote of Thomas Schelling describing an
occasion on which he had decided to buy an encyclopedia for his children:
At the bookstore, he was presented with two attractive encyclopedias and,
 nding it di¤cult to choose between the two, ended up buying neither -
this, despite the fact that had only one encyclopedia been available he
would have happily bought either.
(p. 21)
This is an example of a type of situation, under which people prefer each of the
available alternatives over the status quo but do not have a compelling reason
for choosing among the alternatives and as a result defer the decision, often
inde nitely. Such behaviour clearly violates the principle of irrelevant
alternatives. But it is quite plausible from a reason-based perspective.
4.5 De nite versus disjunctive reasons
In a particularly intriguing experiment, Tversky and Sha r (1992b) presented
subjects with the following set of options (a) buy a very attractive vacation
being o¡ered as a short-term promotion; (b) don't buy it; (c) pay a $36.50
non-refundable fee to have the same choice the following day. Subjects were
given this choice under one of three scenarios: they had just found out they
had passed an important qualifying exam; they had just found out they had
failed it; they will only  nd out if they have passed on the following day. When
subjects already knew whether they had passed or failed, over half chose to
buy the vacation, but when they did not know, 61% of the subjects chose to
pay $5 to have the option to buy the vacation once they did know (vs. 30% and
31% in the other situations). What appears to have produced these results is
that before they knew whether they had passed or failed, the subjects did not
have a de nite reason to go on vacation, even though they were likely to buy
the vacation, both once they knew they had passed or that they had failed.
This does not make any sense from the standpoint of expected utility theory,
since an act which dominates another act under both of two possible states of
the world should dominate that act when it is not known which state of the
world will hold.
4.6 Non-valued features
Several studies have found that adding a non-valued option to a given
commodity, such as the option to buy an unwanted plate if one buys a cake
Rationality as optional choice vs rationality as valid inference
331

mix, actually makes people less likely to buy that commodity. Adding options
that are 'unused' should not lower the given alternative's value, but evidently
adding such 'useless' options provides consumers with a reason to reject the
alternative.
All of these examples illustrate how individuals, when they make choices,
appear to be trying to  nd reasons to justify a particular choice rather than
placing values on the various alternatives open to them and then selecting the
most highly valued alternative. In the context of the psychological literature,
and certainly of the rational choice literature, this result can be seen as one
more instance of a whole stream of  ndings, beginning in the 1950s, that
people are often observed not to behave in accordance with expected utility
theory, that is, that people often turn out to be 'irrational'. Viewed in the
context of the philosophical literature we examined in the preceeding section
however, the result merely shows that it can be demonstrated by the
methods of empirical science that people are rational in the traditional,
pre-empiricist sense, in the sense that they strive to apply their reason to
guide their actions.
5 CONCLUSION
In Section 2 we saw that mainstream economics obtained its concept of
rationality by in e¡ect deliberately abandoning the common-sense view that
people act on the basis of reasons, in order to be able to imitate Newtonian
physics. In section 3 we saw that rational choice theory is not a philosophi-
cally cogent theory, because it su¡ers from the same foundationalist dif-
 culties that made analytic philosophy abandon empiricism (in the period
roughly of 1950-70, when it moved, to quote Rorty (1997: 5, 8), 'out of its
Humean and into its Kantian stage'). Finally, in Section 4 we saw that reason-
based theory is better at explaining human behaviour than is value-based
theory. All of this taken together suggests that if it wishes to be a science,
economics must abandon its concept of rationality as optimization, and
embrace the notion of rationality as valid inference.11 Such a move would
not be as radical as it might seem, since from the standpoint of 'inference
theory', there is a place for normative decision theory. As Sha r et al.
(1993) note,
Formal decision rules . . . may sometimes act as arguments in people's
deliberations. . . . Indeed, it has been repeatedly observed that the axioms
of rational choice which are often violated in non-transparent situations
are generally satis ed when their application is transparent (e.g. Tversky
and Kahnemann 1987). These results suggest that the axioms of rational
choice act as compelling arguments, or reasons, for making a particular
decision when their applicability has been detected, not as universal laws
that constrain people's choices.
(Sha r et al. 1993: 34)
332
Articles

(As an example, the authors mention a violation of transitivity - the
same example Savage used, as we saw in Section 2.) This suggests that
normative decision theory can be subsumed under inference theory, and
thus that the latter is the proper generalization of the former - not
attempted generalizations, which remain within a value-based framework,
which have been pursued by mainstream economists themselves (such as,
e.g. Machina 1982).12 While rational-choice and decision theorists may be
willing to accept inference theory as a descriptive theory - it is now
widely recognized that people regularly violate the axioms of decision
theory, so that such theorists would have little to lose by doing so - they
may be less willing to accept inference theory as the correct general
normative theory of decision. But that it should be so accepted becomes
clear when one considers, as we did at the end of Section 3, that in
general, there are no compelling reasons why all of one's preferences
should be ordered. As a normative theory (as opposed to a psychological
hypothesis about the nature of our desire), rational choice theory derives
its justi cation from the general requirement that we set ourselves as
thinking beings that we must strive for consistency. This requirement is
merely an ideal however, and we must recognize that it is not sensible to
strive for it in all cases. This means that rational choice theory is merely
a particularly precise and re ned expression in the form of a mathemat-
ical model of a few rules of thumb that we follow - not a fundamental
scienti c theory, since fundamental scienti c theories must have universal
validity.
There is always the inevitable possible response that whatever the
empirical and conceptual merits of the notion of reason-based choice, it
can never lead to such rich modeling techniques as does the notion of
value-based choice. That may be true, but then the question arises: what
empirical knowledge does such modeling provide? Value-based rationality
has led neither to an understanding of how competitive markets work
(Ingrao and Israel 1990) nor to an understanding of what the sources of
economic growth are (Lazonick 1991), two central questions for eco-
nomics, mainstream or not. So unless it wishes to pursue modeling just
for its own sake (Boumans 1999), economics, and not just philosophy and
psychology, would do well to move on to a more adequate notion of
rationality. To be sure, an economics that shifted its orientation from
value-based choice to reason-based choice would be signi cantly less
model-driven
than
the mainstream
economics of today,
and
would
resemble more closely the kind of discipline envisioned for example by
(old) institutional economics and the German Historical School.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
An earlier version of this paper was presented at the INEM Conference 2000,
Vancouver, 29 June 2000. I would like to thank Erik Angner, Arnold Katz,
and the editors for helpful comments.
NOTES
1
Lawson characterizes human rationality as follows: 'while there can be no
doubting the skillful, capable and knowledgeable - in short rational - manner
in which people usually act, the concept of rationality implicated in all this is a far
cry from the ever calculating, ranking, optimiser of standard economic theory.
Perhaps Oakeshott's (1962: 109) conception of rationality as the ''certi cate we
give to any conduct which can maintain a place in the  ow of sympathy, the
coherence of activity, which composes a way of living'' captures the notion well'
(Lawson 1997: 121).
2
Thus, Hollis and Sugden's remark in their (1993: 3) (which provides an otherwise
excellent overview of the philosophical origins of rational choice theory) that since
for Hobbes 'ultimate ends are not subject to rational criticism . . . the basic account
of practical reason is similar in Hobbes and Hume', would seem to be a
mischaracterization of Hobbes. But it is not at all unusual:as Gert (1996) remarks,
'The Humean view of reason is probably the standard contemporary view of
reason, and this may account for the fact that most contemporary commentators
view Hobbes as holding such a view. . . . However, just as this view of reason is
coming under attack, there is increasing recognition that much of what Hobbes
says about reason cannot be reconciled with this view' (p. 174).
3
It is worthwhile pausing to consider how implausible this actually is, when one
takes into account the phenomenology of consciousness. In the process of
thinking, thoughts  ow one into the other: preferences are just one manifestation
of this process, a kind of residue, and cannot be separated from this process, since
the mind, in producing itself in thought, produces its preferences, and preferences
have an ephemoral existence indeed outside of this process. To mainstream
economics in contrast, there are just preferences which stand on their own,
without being a component of the mind's process of self-production. Since
these preferences are ordered, they can be described as a utility function, which
is formally identical to a potential function in physics. It is thus from following
Hume's move to separate perceptions and ideas (and hence preferences) from the
activity of the mind that the plausibility of representing human agents as
potential/utility functions derives.
4
Hume framed his philosophy in terms of the passions which impel actions, not in
terms of the mental states which result from actions, as does Bentham. This
distinction was essentially ignored however in economics' reception of utilitarian-
ism. For the suggestion that it might need to be brought back, see Kahneman et al.
(1997).
5
As Hollis and Sugden (1993: 4) note, 'The main line of economic thinking has
followed Hume more often than Kant'. (I am unaware of any truly Kantian
in uences upon economics.) However, they invoke Kant only to suggest the
possibility of an alternative to instrumentalism, namely Kant's theory of practical
reason, according to which reason is able to provide ends to action which are
objectively binding, and not mere arbitrary personal preferences. They are
apparently unaware that Kant's critique of empiricist epistemology also applies
334
Articles

to empiricist philosophy of action from Hobbes on, as I hope will become clear in
the course of this paper, and that Kant thus o¡ers not just a possible solution to
certain di¤culties of game theory, as the authors hope, but a complete reconcep-
tualization of practical reason, one which leaves little room for rational choice
theory.
6
There is a problem with Kant's jurisprudential analogy, according to which norms
are taken to be always explicit: since one follows a rule by interpreting it using
another rule, one runs into an in nite regress. Wittgenstein's (1953) solution was
to see norms as grounded in practices, but we shall ignore that complication here.
7
As was noted on page 320, this is a psychological assumption.
8
As we saw, the  rst part of rational choice theory's myth of the given derives from
Hume, while the second was introduced by Bentham.
9
Of course, that knowledge cannot be justi ed in a foundationalist manner does
not mean that it cannot be justi ed at all. Sellars adopts a position of epistemic
and semantic holism, according to which no belief can support itself, but needs
others to support it, so that one's beliefs end up being mutually supporting.
10
This phenomenon came to be called 'preference reversals' in the economics
literature (Slovic and Lichtenstein 1983) - ironically, since it actually undermines
the preference concept as a fundamental category for the understanding of human
action.
11
To the extent it wishes to be a re ection theory (of the economy) and not a science,
that is, to describe the economy from the economy's own, as opposed to from an
objective, point of view (Luhmann 1997, Viskovato¡ 1998), economics could of
course stay with rationality-as-optimization, since that re ects the economy's own
'self-understanding': the paradigmatic economic activity in pro t maximization,
and that certainly is a species of value maximization.
12
Sha r et al.'s remark also illustrates the extent to which philosophy and psycho-
logy are converging in their understanding of rationality and choice: the authors
explicitly make the same distinction between rules as universal laws 'constrain[ing]
people's choices' (that is, exerting their in uence on people independently of
people's intentionality, in the way that natural laws do) and rules as reasons that
we introduced in Section 3.
