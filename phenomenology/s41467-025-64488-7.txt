Time crystals, as temporal analogs of space crystals, manifest as stable and
periodic behavior that breaks time translation symmetry. In an open quantum
system, many-body interaction subjected to dissipation allows one to develop
the time crystalline order in an unprecedented way, as refer to dissipative time
crystals. Here we report the observation of multiple time crystals in the con-
tinuously driven-dissipative and strongly interacting Rydberg thermal gases, in
which continuous time crystals, sub-harmonic time crystals and high-
harmonic time crystals are observed in the same system by manipulating
the Rydberg excitation. Our work provides new ways to explore the non-
equilibrium phases of matter in open systems. Such time crystals with per-
sistent oscillation rooted in emergent quantum correlations, may emerge as a
ubiquitous tool in quantum metrology, for instance, continuous sensing and
parameter estimation surpassing the standard quantum limit.
Crystal is a collection of atoms with the periodic arrangement in space,
a celebrated example of spontaneous spatial translation symmetry
breaking, ranging from salt and jewelry in daily life to bulk materials in
the condensed matter experiment. We are accustomed to an inherent
impression that time is on an equal footing with space, are thus curious
whether time-translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken to
form a time crystal. The original proposal of continuous time crystals
(CTC) for isolated many-body systems in equilibrium1 is prohibited by
no-go theorems2,3. Instead, discrete time crystals (DTC) undergoing
the spontaneous breaking of discrete time translation symmetry4-6
were discovered by applying a periodic external drive in an interacting
many-body system under the ergodicity breaking. Such a closed sys-
tem features a subharmonic response7-12, and the associated time
crystalline
order
is
stabilized
by
disorder-induced
many-body
localization10,13,14 or prethermalization due to sufﬁciently high Floquet
drive frequency9,15.
An alternate strategy to stabilize the time crystalline order is
dissipation16-23, which is conventionally believed to destroy the order.
Similar to reservoir engineering for preparing the desired quantum
states, the discrete time crystalline order in a driven open Dicke model
was
realized
by
tailoring
system-environment
coupling
appropriately24-26. Remarkably, following the pioneering theoretical
works18,27, a limit cycle phase without a recurring external force has also
been conﬁrmed recently in the platform of dissipative-driven Dicke
model with ultra-cold atoms inside an optical cavity28. As the mani-
festation of CTC, a persistent oscillation robust against temporal
perturbations was observed, taking the random phase between 0 and
2π for different realizations28,29. In view of the foregoing, it is natural to
raise a question, whether the interplay of strong interaction, dissipa-
tion and synchronization in the non-equilibrium open system could
further enrich dynamic phases that spontaneously break time trans-
lation symmetry.
Here, we report the observation of a complex time crystalline
order in the dissipative Rydberg gas at room temperature, exhi-
biting a series of spontaneous self-sustained oscillations of limit
cycles under the time-independent external driving. Importantly,
we perform the experiments with full control of the magnetic
sub-states coupled by the light ﬁelds, the emergent limit cycles
thus are unlikely to be caused by competing Rydberg states, as
proposed
in30.

high-order harmonic oscillations of limit cycles emerge succes-
sively in this open, quantum many-body system, regarded as sub-
harmonic time crystals and high-harmonic time crystals, respec-
tively. Such additional features of magnetic sub-state control are
absent in previous works, including recent observations of CTC30,
a transient oscillation31 and synchronized oscillation32 in limit
cycles with continuously driven Rydberg gas, leading to a fur-
thering of knowledge on the phenomenon. Our work thus pro-

Results
Experimental setup
We consider an ensemble of Rydberg atoms at room temperature. As
illustrated in Fig. 1a, two laser beams, referred as probe and coupling,
excite the ground state ∣g

to the Rydberg state ∣ri via an intermediate
state ∣ei. This forms a ladder-type electromagnetically induced trans-
parency (EIT) conﬁguration, the associated strong interaction is given
by the Hamiltonian ^HI = P
i < jV ij^nr
i ^nr
j with the local Rydberg density ^nr
i
and the van der Waals interaction V ij / C6=∣r!
i  r!
j∣
6 between
Rydberg atoms located at r!
i and r!
j, with C6 the dispersive coefﬁcient
(C6 < 0 for cesium 60D5/2 atom used here).
To experimentally observe the non-equilibrium phases of matter
in the thermal Rydberg gas, we use a resonant two-photon excitation
scheme in a Cesium vapor cell. The counter-propagating probe
(852 nm, Ωp) and control (509 nm, Ωc) ﬁelds set up the Rydberg EIT
process (Fig. 1a). A magnetic ﬁeld B = 11.8 G along the propagation
direction is applied to induce the large Zeeman splitting, thus ensuring
the exact Zeeman level of the involving states can be speciﬁed by the
polarization of the beams (See the Supplementary Note 2A). In this
work, two laser beams with σ+ circular polarization excite the transition
of ∣g

= ∣6S1=2, F = 4, mF = 4i to ∣ri = ∣60D5=2, mj = 5=2i via the inter-
mediate state ∣ei = ∣6P3=2, F0 = 5, m0
F = 5i with detuning of Δp =
2π × 70 MHz. A differential detection is used to suppress the laser
intensity noise.
We stress that only single Rydberg state, ∣60D5=2, mj = 5=2i, is
involved in the driving scheme since we select the conﬁguration of
Rydberg transition via laser polarization, which distinguishes our
ﬁnding sharply from the recent work30 where the appearance of
oscillations is attributed to a competition of multiple Rydberg states.
Scanned transmission spectra for the different polarizations are plot-
ted in Supplementary Fig. 6.
Observation of multiple time crystal phases

berg excitation facilitates the observation of time crystalline phases in
the limit cycle. Here, we perform a scanning EIT spectroscopy

measurement by engineering the Rydberg excitation in terms of Rabi
frequencies of the control ﬁeld, Ωc. In experiments, we scan the cou-
pling laser frequency at a typical scan rate of 2π × 7 MHz/ms. Below a
certain value of Ωc = 2π × 1.1 MHz, normal EIT spectra are observed,
while the optical bistable phase emerges if exceeding it. By increasing
Ωc further, we observe oscillations of the transmission signal at the
range of two-photon detuning Δ/2π ~ 35-45 MHz, and Fig. 1b displays a
typical transmission EIT spectrum exhibiting self-sustained oscillation
at Ωc = 2π × 2.3 MHz. Insets illustrate a typical realization of sponta-
neous self-sustained oscillation at the detuning Δ = 2π × 40 MHz. The
associated normalized single-sided amplitude spectrum A(ω) is shown
in the right panel. A narrow peak at ωLC/2π = 8.56 kHz with the full
width athalf maximum of 0.05 kHz (atime window of 16 ms) suggests a
stable periodic oscillatory pattern (high frequency peaks display high
harmonic components of oscillations).
As deﬁned, the spontaneous breaking of continuous time trans-
lation symmetry and robustness against temporal perturbations con-
stitute
the
essence
of
continuous
time
crystals.
Regarding
characterization of the robustness, we apply a white noise onto the
probe beam, and use the relative crystalline fractions Ξ to describe the
robustness of the CTC on the noise strength N28. The relative crystal-
line fractions and the noise strength N are deﬁned by Ξ =
Σω = ωLC ± δωjAðωÞj=ΣωjAðωÞj and N = Σω∣Pn(ω)∣/Σω∣P0(ω)∣−1, respectively.
δω denotes the resolution of the single-sided amplitude, Pn and P0 are
the single-sided amplitude spectra of the probe laser with and without
white noise. Fig. 1c shows the measured crystalline fraction as a func-
tion of the noise strength N. We also analyze the associated temporal
dynamics, Fourier transformation and temporal correlation function
of the oscillation spectra in the presence of noise, see Supplementary
Fig. 8. Furthermore, the demonstration of long-term phase stability in
the presence of noise N = 2.1 is plotted in Supplementary Fig. 9. All
the measurements in the presence of noise demonstrate that the
oscillation exists over a wide parameter range, indicating the limit
cycle
phase
is
to
some
extent
insensitive
to
the
temporal
perturbations.
In Fig. 1d, we show the time phase of oscillations are randomly
distributed over [0, 2π] for 250 independent realizations, indicative of
spontaneous breaking of continuous time translation symmetry. This
observed random phase property is crucial to support the identiﬁca-
tion of spontaneous breaking of continuous time translation sym-
metry, and thus the time crystalline phase. Speciﬁcally, in order to rule
out the experimental imperfections induced phase drift over time,
Fig. 1e displays a single-shot realization of quench dynamics exhibiting
an oscillation frequency of 9.615 kHz at Ωc = 2π × 2.9 MHz, where the
probe ﬁeld is suddenly switched on and held at a constant power. This
140 ms-time trace shows the good phase stability of a single realization
on timescales spanning several independent realizations [Fig. 1e1-e3].
Moreover, in such phase, we experimentally investigate the depen-
dence of the oscillation frequency by varying the Rabi frequency of the
control ﬁeld. Given the ﬁxed Rabi frequency of the probe ﬁeld and bias
magnetic ﬁeld, the experimental result shows the oscillation frequency
is linearly proportional to the coupling laser Rabi frequency, shown in
Fig. 1f, and its associated simulation results in Fig. 1g.
To explore the CTC phase further and probe the boundary of this
phase, we slightly increase the coupling laser Rabi frequency Ωc from
2π × 2.3 MHz to 2π × 2.8 MHz. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd another persistent
periodic oscillation at a lower frequency in the scanned transmission
EIT spectrum (Fig. 2a). By analyzing the frequency of two oscillation
components for the detuning Δ = 2π × 57 MHz and 2π × 78 MHz, we
ﬁnd the new emergent oscillation has a frequency of 4.38 kHz (inset
top panel in Fig. 2a) that is half of the CTC oscillations, 9.07 kHz (inset
bottom panel in Fig. 2a). We also test the robustness of the limit cycle
and the random distribution of its time phase to rule out the possibility
of classical nonlinearity, shown in Fig. 2b, c. All the observations
demonstrate a sub-harmonic time crystal.
Experimentally, when lifting the coupling Rabi frequency up to
2π × 5.0 MHz, the scanned transmission EIT spectrum manifests
emergent higher-order harmonics (labeled with f1 and f2), in addition
to the CTC and sub-harmonic oscillations (labeled with f and f/2),
shown in Fig. 3a. We extract their oscillation frequencies by discrete

of 50.71 kHz, 20.23 kHz, 6.04 kHz, and 12.31 kHz, respectively, roughly
corresponding to f2 ≈4f, f1 ≈3f/2, f/2 and f, shown as the right inset.
Subsequently, random distributions of their time phase with 250
repeated realizations are observed (Figs. 3b1-e1), verifying the higher
harmonics of limit cycle phases. Moreover, we demonstrate all oscil-
lation frequencies increase linearly with the coupling laser Rabi fre-
quency as we expected, shown in Figs. 3b2-e2.
Theoretical explanation
To explain the observation of multiple time crystalline phases on the
theoretical side, we consider a three-level model32. The associated
Hamiltonian, ^H, matching the experimental conﬁguration in Fig. 1, is

For a driven-dissipative system such as Rydberg gases, the system
dynamics is governed by the Lindblad master equation,
∂t^ρ = Lð^ρÞ =  i½^H, ^ρ + Lgeð^ρÞ + Lgrð^ρÞ + Lerð^ρÞ,

where Lαβð^ρÞ describes the dissipation channel between level α and β.
In general, the competition between strong interaction-induced
nonlinearity and dissipation can lead to complex mathematical
solutions for the equations of motion (EOM). These solutions may
exhibit riches of phenomena such as multistability, periodic oscilla-
tions, and other exotic non-equilibrium many-body phases. Examples
include optical bistability33, self-organized criticality34, and transitions
toward synchronization32.
For the time-independent Hamiltonian, periodic oscillatory solu-
tions imply the spontaneous breaking of continuous time-translation
symmetry, also called CTC. Despite CTC in thermal Rydberg gases has

been recently reported30, a key outstanding question remains unre-
solved: the dependence of the oscillation frequency on system para-
meters. To circumvent this limitation, we explicitly leverage the
concept of boundary time crystal (BTC)27. In fact, as stated in Ref. 27,
the interacting Rydberg atomic system represents one of the most
promising platforms for realizing BTC. In this framework, the inter-
acting Rydberg atoms correspond to the boundary while the envir-
onment (the system bath) constitutes the bulk35,36. An oscillatory phase
is induced by the interplay between driving and dissipation, with its
characteristic frequency expected to scale linearly with the coupling
Rabi frequency Ωc. This analysis offers a theoretical explanation for the
linear oscillatory frequency dependence observed in Fig. 1f, in contrast
with the previously observed inverse relationship to Rabi frequency in
Ref. 30, in which the self-sustained oscillation originates from the
competition of Rydberg excitations.
From a numerical perspective, it is impractical to directly solve
the nonlinear master equation in Eq. (2) for large systems. Here, we
employ the mean-ﬁeld (MF) approach, a standard treatment for ther-
mal Rydberg gases33,37, to address the strong nonlinear effect. Speci-
ﬁcally, we develop a modiﬁed MF approach to include the high-order
corrections, for instance, h^nri
2h^σgri, h^nri
3h^σgri, stemming from the
commutator between the Rydberg interaction term ^HI and the density
matrix elements. See "Methods" and Supplementary Note 1 for more
details.
By combining the solutions of MF equation, we establish a theo-
retical framework explaining our observation of the multiple time
crystalline. As demonstrated, the dynamics comprises three distinct
phases: continuous time crystal, sub-harmonic time crystal, and high-
harmonic time crystal.
(1) Continuous time crystal. Given the time-independent drive, an
oscillatory solution of the observable nr is allowed in the parameter
space. This originates from the nonlinearity (/ ^nr
i ^nr
j ) and is induced by
the Rydberg interactions. Particularly, in such a three-level driven-
dissipative system, three different phases with distinct time-evolution
behavior can be identiﬁed, which are denoted as steady state (SS),
bistable state (BS), oscillatory and bistable state (OBS), respectively.
Concretely, in the SS phase, the Rydberg population nr approaches one
stable solution, while this observable in the BS phase ﬁnally converges
to two stable values. Strikingly, the dynamics of nr in the OBS phase
exhibit the self-sustained oscillation for the upper branch solution,
which is expressed as the co-existence of the oscillation and steady
state. Consequently, we can ﬁnd the self-sustained oscillation in this
OBS phase, where the oscillation period is continuously varying. We
regard it as the correspondence of the region with f oscillatory fre-
quency in Fig. 1b, and in such phase we numerically ﬁnd that the
simulated frequency relation in Fig. 1g is qualitatively in agreement
with the experiments. Moreover, we also show the existence of Hopf
bifurcation in the Supplementary Note 1B, which is used to interpret
the emergence of the limit cycle. In combination with the robustness
to perturbations and random phase distribution over [0, 2π] by dif-
ferent experimental repetitions given the phase stability of a single
time trace as shown in Fig. 1e, CTC can be identiﬁed.
(2) Sub-harmonic time crystal. Upon the occurrence of the CTC,
when increasing the Rabi frequency of the coupling laser, we observe
the subharmonic time crystal. We explain this phenomenon as a result
of the periodic driving in the presence of bistability, as illustrated in
Ref. 20. Here, the origin of this periodic driving is collisions-generated
charged particles conﬁned by a magnetic ﬁeld, producing signiﬁcant
periodic electric ﬁelds that shift the resonance condition of the Ryd-
berg excitation via the Stark effect in terms of the detuning Δc. In fact,
collisions between Rydberg atoms and ground-state atoms in the
thermal
Rydberg
gases
result
in
the
generation
of
charged
particles38,39. The corresponding charge density nearly scales linearly
with the Rydberg atom density. In short words, in this driven-
dissipative system, CTC behaves as the self-sustained oscillation of
the Rydberg atom density, leading to the periodically oscillating
charge density and thus producing signiﬁcant periodic electric ﬁelds.
Importantly, the oscillation frequency of the generated electric ﬁelds is
the same as that of the CTC, as a result of the linear proportional
relationship between the charge density and the Rydberg atom den-
sity. Experimental veriﬁcation can be found in Supplementary Fig. 14.
Thus, the detuning Δc becomes time-dependent with the same oscil-
latory frequency as the oscillation frequency of the Rydberg atom
density. In the nonlinear bistable regime, such an inherent oscillation
behaves as a periodic drive and stimulates the system to perform the
robust sub-harmonic response, forming a sub-harmonic time crystal
phase. More details about the numerical simulation and additional
experiments can be found in the Supplementary.
(3) High-harmonic time crystal. At even a much stronger Rabi
drive and lower detuning, the nonlinearity interaction dominates over
other effects. Firstly, the average Rydberg excitation is expected to
increase as Δc approaches the small detuning region, corresponding to
f1 and f2 phase. Secondly, it has been predicted that the oscillation
frequency scales with the Rabi frequency. Taken together, these
observations suggest that a higher Rydberg population enhances the
interactions, which in turn leads to an increase in the oscillatory fre-
quency. To verify this in the numeric, we both reduce Δc and enlarge Ωc
to mimic the experimental conditions. In particular, we consider the
average of trajectories from various initial conditions to describe the
mixed state of the hot vapor. We ﬁnd a larger oscillatory frequency as
the parameters change, shown as Supplementary Fig. 5. The numerical
results indicate that the emergence of higher frequency stable oscil-
lations is related to the stronger interaction, which is comparable to
the experimental ﬁndings. See Supplementary Note 1E for the details.
Discussion
We report the observation of a complex time crystalline order in an
ensemble of thermal Rydberg gases under continuous driving. The
observed self-sustained oscillations are recognized as continuous time
crystals, sub-harmonic time crystals and high-harmonic time crystals.
As an intrinsically out-of-equilibrium system, it provides a simple but
versatile platform for exploring the exotic dynamic phases of open
quantum systems40-43, such as macroscopic quantum synchronization
effect44,45. As suggested by recent work46, time crystals observed here
may be exploited in quantum metrology, such as continuous sensing
surpassing the standard quantum limit47, and time crystalline order as
a frequency standard48.
Methods
Experimental details
The experiment is conducted on a room-temperature Cs vapour
cell (with a diameter of 2.5 cm and a length of 7.5 cm). The 852 nm and
509 nm lasers are delivered by Toptica DL pro and Precilasers,
respectively. A high ﬁnesse ultralow expansion (ULE) cavity provides
the feedback for the frequency stabilization of both lasers (FSR:
1.5 GHz, Finesse 1.5 × 105). The tunable offset-lock frequency ensures
the measurement of the limit cycle phase and robustness with ﬁxed
laser detuning. In addition, the 509 nm laser works in frequency-
scanning mode for the measurement of the scanned EIT transmission
spectrum. In this condition, the coupling laser frequency is calibrated
by the cavity transmission spectrum. The 1/e2 beam waist of 852 nm
and 509 nm are ωp = 425 μm and ωc = 450 μm, respectively. The
homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B along with the probe direction is
generated by a Helmholtz coil with 220 mm inner diameter. A probe
and a reference beam pass through two identical acoustic optical
modulators (AOMs) before entering the cell. When exploring the
robustness against temporal perturbations of time crystals, we intro-
duce white noise onto the probe beam by adding the white noise
strength to modulate the RF amplitude of the AOM, rather than the
reference beam.

Theoretical details
Here, we provide the details on the theoretical derivation. The
dynamics of the Rydberg atom are well described by an effective
three-level model. The Hamiltonian of the atomic system is
deﬁned in Eq. (1). As an open system, we consider the Master
equation ∂t^ρ = Lð^ρÞ to describe the evolution of the system, with
the dissipation,
Lαβð^OÞ = Γαβ X

where Γαβ is the dissipation strength between level α and β. We consider
a total of three decay channels in the simulation. The evolution for the
average value of the observable ^O is,
∂th^Oi = hi½^H, ^O + Lgeð^OÞ + Lgrð^OÞ + Lerð^OÞi:
ð4Þ
where h^Oi is the average value of operator ^O. The equation of motion
for the observable on each site now reads,

Since
the
Hamiltonian
is
translation
invariant,
we
consider
the solution with the translation symmetry, i.e., dropping the index i,
h^Oii = h^Oi. Moreover, it is worth noting that the commutator
between
the
interaction
term
^HI
and
^σαβ
returns
the
term
iP
jV ijh^nβ
j ^σαβ
i i, resulting in the non-linearity and bring the difﬁculty to
exactly solve.
To simplify Eq. (5), we employ the MF treatment. The spirit of the
MF is formularized as h^α^βi  h^αih^βi at the lowest order33,37. For exam-
ple, it can be used in handling the term h^nr ^σgri mentioned above.
However, taking the strong interaction into account, the high-order
term arising from the modiﬁcation of the lowest order, such as
h^nri
2h^σαri, h^nri
3h^σαri. Concretely, ð^nrÞ
x^σαr is generated from the com-
mutator between the ð^nrÞ
x1^σαr and ^σαr. This high-order term will
introduce more nonlinearity and further affect the solution, and may
lead to novel physics. Here we expand the commutator term
P
jV ijh^nr
j ^σαr
i i to the third order as an empirical choice,
V 1h^nrih^σαri + V 2h^nri
2h^σαri + V 3h^nri
3h^σαri,
ð6Þ
where V1, V2, V3 are the corresponding coefﬁcients for each order. After
MF approximations, the EOM can be numerically solved by the Runge-
Kutta method, and all time-dependent behaviors are thus able to be
obtained.
