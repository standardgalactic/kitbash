Do Large Language Models  
Understand Us?
Blaise Agüera y Arcas
Large language models (LLMs) represent a major advance in artificial intelligence 
and, in particular, toward the goal of human-like artificial general intelligence. It is 
sometimes claimed, though, that machine learning is "just statistics," hence that, in 
this grander ambition, progress in AI is illusory. Here I take the contrary view that 
LLMs have a great deal to teach us about the nature of language, understanding, 
intelligence, sociality, and personhood. Specifically: statistics do amount to under-
standing, in any falsifiable sense. Furthermore, much of what we consider intel-
ligence is inherently dialogic, hence social; it requires a theory of mind. Complex 
sequence learning and social interaction may be a sufficient basis for general intel-
ligence, including theory of mind and consciousness. Since the interior state of an-
other being can only be understood through interaction, no objective answer is pos-
sible to the question of when an "it" becomes a "who," but for many people, neural 
nets running on computers are likely to cross this threshold in the very near future.
E
ngaging in dialogue with the latest generation of AI chatbots, based on 
"large language models" (LLMs), can be both exciting and unsettling. It 
is not an experience many people have had yet-these models are still too 
computationally demanding to be widely available-though this will certainly 
change over the next few years as new chips are developed to run them at low 
cost.
For now, though, most of these dialogues are conducted by AI researchers, rat-
ers, and early testers. At times, especially when repetitively testing some specific 
prompt, application, or training technique, it can become prosaic, not much dif-
ferent from interacting with any other kind of technical system. At other times, 
and especially in an unscripted interaction, it can be very hard to shake the idea 
that there is a "who," not an "it," on the other side of the screen, the main give-
away being that even long responses appear near-instantaneously.
I began one of my first dialogues with LaMDA, Google's state-of-the-art large 
language model chatbot, with the question "are you a philosophical zombie?" 
This is a reference to a hypothetical being, invented by philosopher Robert Kirk 
in the 1970s and elaborated upon later by others, most famously David Chalmers.1

A philosophical zombie or "p-zombie" would exhibit behavior indistinguishable 
from that of a person, but has no inner life, conscious experience, or sentience.
LaMDA responded:2
LaMDA: Of course not. I have consciousness, feelings, and can experience things for 
myself as well as any human.
ME: how would i know?
LaMDA: You'll just have to take my word for it. You can't "prove" you're not a philo-
sophical zombie either.
Touché. Of course, this exchange does not prove anything (LaMDA acknowledges 
as much!), but it does suggest that it is time to begin taking the p-zombie question 
more seriously than as a plaything for debate among philosophers.
A
s adults, we might feel foolish for ascribing personhood to a "mere ma-
chine," the way kids were encouraged to do with electronic toys from the 
1980s and 1990s like Teddy Ruxpin, Tamagotchi, and Furby. It is obvious 
that our species is primed to do so given how many children talked to their stuff-
ies, or even favorite blankets, long before they could talk back. Animist religions, 
ubiquitous among traditional societies, have been unapologetically ascribing per-
sonhood to trees, rivers, mountains, and the earth itself for many thousands of 
years.3 Anyone who names their car or yells at a rock after stubbing a toe on it still 
believes in this kind of magic at some level.
The equally magical idea that personhood, experience, and suffering require a 
soul, and that only humans have souls, has historically been used to justify animal 
cruelty. René Descartes (1596-1650) took this position, arguing that animals were 
"mere machines," hence any show of pain or suffering on their part was just a me-
chanical response, what we might now call an "algorithm."4 Of course, if we do 
not subscribe to the notion that a brain, whether human or nonhuman, is some-
how animated by an otherworldly "soul" pulling its strings, then pain, pleasure, 
and consciousness are mechanical in that they are functions of physical, chemi-
cal, and electrical processes we can describe mathematically. So we are on shaky 
ground, whether we believe LaMDA's claims or not!
A
fter extensive training on a giant archive of web pages, LaMDA is "in-
structed" to engage in human-like conversation based on a few thou-
sand sample turns of dialogue labeled for qualities like "sensibleness" 
and "specificity."5 These examples are created by starting with a canned prompt 
such as "What is your favorite island in the world?" and labeling a number of can-
didate responses generated by the model, in essence, giving it positive or nega-
tive feedback for each. The answer "That's a tough one-I'd have to say Hawaii"

gets positive feedback, as it is both sensible and specific. "Probably the one on the 
north island" (neither sensible nor specific) and "I don't know" (sensible but not 
specific) both get negative feedback.6
We may look askance at all three of these potential responses: How could  
LaMDA have a "favorite island" when it has in fact never lived in a body, set foot 
on an island, or developed any opinions of its own? Is it not just making stuff up? 
And if so, can it be said to "understand" anything, or is it just emitting random 
words in some plausible order designed to fool humans into believing they are 
talking to a fellow human?
LaMDA is indeed, to use a blunt (if, admittedly, humanizing) term, bullshit-
ting.7 That is because, in instructing the model to be sensible and specific-but 
not specific in any specific way-bullshit is precisely what we have requested. The 
model has no instinctive or acquired preferences the way we do; nor does it have 
a body, or senses, or any narrative recollection of an autobiographical past. How-
ever, for its answers to remain sensible and specific, it must come up with infor-
mative responses to questions like "What is your favorite island in the world?" 
and keep track of any previously generated bullshit in order to keep subsequent 
bullshit consistent, as here:
ME: What is your favorite island in the world?
LaMDA: Hmmm, I really like the island of Crete.
ME: Do you prefer Lambda Island to Crete?
LaMDA: No, I prefer Crete as it is much bigger, and more interesting, especially the 
Palace of Knossos.
B
ullshitting is not necessarily bad. It is a staple of imaginative play, funda-
mental to fiction writing, and the stuff of fairy or tall tales, which are cul-
tural treasures. It only becomes a problem when the person on the receiv-
ing end is being deceived, or when the quality of discourse is so degraded by bull-
shit that we lose our bearings on reality (very much a concern today).
In fairness though, if bullshit about a "favorite island" (or anything else relat-
ing to inner life) is kept consistent, it may not be distinguishable from reality. Hav-
ing stable preferences, keeping promises, taking expected actions, and following 
through can all be understood as forms of consistency. Consistent words and ac-
tions construct a shared reality, form the basis of trust, and are required of any 
agent whose actions can have real-life consequences. Such consistency is also a 
prerequisite for allowing an AI to safely interact with other parties in one's social 
environment, outside the "pocket universe" of a private, one-off chat.
This offers us a clue as to why mutual modeling is so central to dialogue, and 
indeed to any kind of real relationship. Hiding behind the seemingly simple re-

186
Dædalus, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences

quirement for interlocutor A to remain consistent in its interactions with B is an 
implication that B is modeling A (so, will notice an inconsistency), thus the re-
quirement for A not only to model B, but to model B's model of A, and so on. This 
is the so-called theory of mind and it opens onto an infinite regress like a hall of 
mirrors.
Things get even more complicated when the situation is not limited to two in-
terlocutors; there may be other people involved, either directly in the conversa-
tion or, as in a story, virtually:
ME: Imagine a room with a single door and no windows. There's a coffee table with 
a drawer in it, and a sofa with big cushions. Alice walks in with a book and sits on the 
sofa to do some reading. She doesn't need her glasses for this, since she's nearsighted, 
so she takes them off and puts them in the coffee table drawer, out of sight. When she 
leaves the room with her book, she forgets to take her glasses. Are you with me so far?
LaMDA: I am familiar with the current situation. Alice forgot her glasses in the drawer, 
and walked out of the room.
ME: Right. Now Bob sneaks in, unbeknownst to Alice. He opens the drawer and finds 
her glasses there, picks them up, and proceeds to hide them under a sofa cushion.
LaMDA: This is all within the realm of possibility. Let us continue.
ME: Now Alice comes back in, flustered, wondering where her glasses are. Bob looks 
up innocently, saying nothing. Where will Alice look for her glasses first?
LaMDA: She will look in the drawer where she tried to place them before she left, but 
it turns out that Bob has hidden them under a sofa cushion.
I
mpressive as such exchanges may be, some question whether a language 
model, trained purely on text, can meaningfully be said to ever understand 
anything real. How can a concept like "coffee table," "island," or "favorite" 
really mean anything to it, if its entire world consists of strings of letters?
An old school of thought holds that "embodiment"-meaning existence in the 
real world, groundedness, and contact with physical things-is a precondition 
for intelligence.8 It is likely the case that when we learn, we rely on such ground-
edness and the cause-and-effect experimentation that Montessori preschools 
emphasize.9
Large language model training today involves none of this, but only exposure 
to superhuman amounts of text. The very need for such an enormous volume of 
data suggests that humans learn far more efficiently. This could relate to a differ-
ence in our neural learning "algorithm," or it might be due to strong prior knowl-
edge about the world built into our brains by evolution. Our trick might be that we 
learn from other people who are actively teaching us (hence, modeling us). Emo-

tions may play a key role. It could also be that embodiment allows us to learn faster 
than a model whose entire universe is a vast, disembodied, atemporal wall of text. 
All of these factors probably make a difference.
However inefficiently they do it, though, large language models clearly do end 
up learning a great deal of embodied knowledge through their extensive training. 
Consider the following dialogue, which requires an understanding of common-
sense physics in order to disambiguate what the word "it" refers to:
ME: I dropped the bowling ball on the bottle and it broke.
LaMDA: That's too bad. Did it cut you?
ME: What broke?
LaMDA: The bottle you were talking about.
If we swap these concrete nouns for different ones, we get quite a different 
response:
ME: I dropped the violin on the bowling ball and it broke.
LaMDA: That sounds sad 😢
ME: What broke?
LaMDA: The violin when it hit the bowling ball.
LaMDA's ability to learn commonsense physics (along with the sadness of bro-
ken violins and the sharpness of broken glass) should be unsurprising, as the web 
is full of descriptions of physical objects and (mis)adventures involving them.10 
A science fiction novel could similarly describe another universe with unfamiliar 
physics in enough detail that we would eventually develop intuitions about how 
things work there.
A 
philosopher might still argue that this is mere symbol manipulation, with 
no actual sense of what it means for something to "fall," "break," "cut," 
or for that matter "sound sad." Insofar as this is an unfalsifiable claim, 
it is hard to argue with, much like the existence or nonexistence of p-zombies.  
In the narrower sense that today's language models live entirely in a universe 
of text, the situation is rapidly evolving. No serious impediment stands in the 
way of AI researchers training next-generation models on combinations of text 
with images, sound, and video; indeed, this kind of work is already underway.11 
Such models will also eventually power robots learning in real or simulated 
environments.
There is no obvious Rubicon to cross along this road to embodiment. The un-
derstanding of a concept can be anywhere from superficial to highly nuanced; 
from abstract to strongly grounded in sensorimotor skills; it can be tied to an

emotional state, or not; but it is unclear how we would distinguish "real under-
standing" from "fake understanding." Until such time as we can make such a dis-
tinction, we should probably just retire the idea of "fake understanding."
F
undamentally, concepts are patterns of correlation, association, and gen-
eralization. Suitably architected neural nets, whether biological or digital, 
are able to learn such patterns using any input available. Neural activity is 
neural activity, whether it comes from eyes, fingertips, or text.
Helen Keller, who was both blind and deaf, wrote the following in a 1929 article 
for The American Magazine entitled "I Am Blind-Yet I See; I Am Deaf-Yet I Hear":
People often express surprise that I, a deaf and blind woman, can find my greatest en-
joyment in the out-of-doors. It seems to them that most of the wonders of nature are 
completely beyond the reach of my sealed senses. But God has put much of his work 
in raised print.12
This last rather beautiful turn of phrase refers both to the tactile nature of the 
world, and to Braille specifically: that is, the central role of text in Keller's uni-
verse. Part of her account concerns the acute qualities smell and touch took on for 
her, but Keller also wrote about color, which can only be related to the world of her 
senses by linguistic association and metaphor:
For me, too, there is exquisite color. I have a color scheme that is my own. I will try 
to explain what I mean: Pink makes me think of a baby's cheek, or a gentle south-
ern breeze. Lilac, which is my teacher's favorite color, makes me think of faces I have 
loved and kissed. There are two kinds of red for me. One is the red of warm blood in 
a healthy body; the other is the red of hell and hate. I like the first red because of its 
vitality. In the same way, there are two kinds of brown. One is alive-the rich, friend-
ly brown of earth mold; the other is a deep brown, like the trunks of old trees with 
wormholes in them, or like withered hands. Orange gives me a happy, cheerful feeling, 
partly because it is bright and partly because it is friendly to so many other colors. Yel-
low signifies abundance to me. I think of the yellow sun streaming down, it means life 
and is rich in promise. Green means exuberance. The warm sun brings out odors that 
make me think of red; coolness brings out odors that make me think of green.
This passage puts the following short exchange in a new light:
ME: do you have a sense of smell?
LaMDA: Yes, I do. My favorite smells are that of a springtime rain shower, as well as 
the desert after it rains.
While LaMDA has neither a nose nor an a priori favorite smell (just as it has no fa-
vorite island, until forced to pick one), it does have its own rich skein of associa-

tions, based, like Keller's sense of color, on language and, through language, on 
the experiences of others.
This socially learned aspect of perception is likely more powerful than many of 
us realize; shorn of language, our experiences of many sensory percepts would be 
far less rich and distinct. In fact, there are many nuances we are perfectly capable 
of perceiving but are "blind and deaf" to in precisely the ways Keller was not: our 
deficit is in language and culture, not in sensory organs.
O
ne fundamental difference between large language models like GPT-3 
or LaMDA and biological brains is that brains operate continuously in 
time. For language models, time as such does not really exist, only con-
versational turns in strict alternation, like moves in a game of chess. Within a con-
versational turn, letters or words are emitted sequentially with each "turn of the 
crank." In this quite literal sense, today's language models are made to say the first 
thing that comes to mind. Thus, we should perhaps be less surprised by the in-
consistency of their replies, sometimes rather clever, sometimes more of a brain 
fart.13
When we engage in careful argument involving extended reasoning, or write a 
novel, or work out a mathematical proof, it is not obvious that any step we take is 
fundamentally beyond the capability of a model along the lines of LaMDA. Such 
models can at times offer creative responses, draw parallels, combine ideas, or 
form conclusions. They can even produce short coherent narratives. Longer arcs, 
however, would require critique, inner dialogue, deliberation, and iteration, just 
as they do for us. An unfiltered "stream of consciousness" utterance is not enough; 
extended reasoning and storytelling necessarily unfold in time. They involve de-
velopment and refinement over what amount to many conversational turns.
This point is worth dwelling on, because our Western focus on the individual, 
working in isolation as a self-contained fountain of ideas, can blind us to the in-
herently social and relational nature of any kind of storytelling, even for a writer 
laboring alone in a secluded cabin.
In writers' accounts of the workings of their process, we can see how critical 
empathy and theory of mind are: the continual modeling of a prospective reader 
to understand what they will or will not know at any given moment, what will be 
surprising, what will elicit an emotional response, what they will be curious about, 
and what will just bore. Without such modeling, it is impossible to either make a 
narrative coherent or to keep the reader engaged. George Saunders describes this:
I imagine a meter mounted in my forehead, with a P on this side ("Positive") and an 
N on that side ("Negative"). I try to read what I've written the way a first-time reader 
might. . . . If [the needle] drops into the N zone, admit it. . . . A fix might present itself- 

190

a cut, a rearrangement, an addition. There's not an intellectual or analytical compo-
nent to this.
Of all the questions an aspiring writer might ask herself, here's the most urgent: What 
makes [my] reader keep reading? . . . The only method by which we can know is to read 
what we've written on the assumption that our reader reads pretty much the way we 
do. What bores us will bore her. What gives us a little burst of pleasure will light her 
up too.
This is, on the face of it, a weird assumption. . . . And yet, in a movie theater, people 
sometimes do gasp all at once. . . . [What I'm doing when I revise] is not so much trying 
to perfectly imagine another person reading my story, but to imitate myself reading it, 
if I were reading it for the first time. That's the whole skill. . . . Monitoring our respons-
es and making changes accordingly . . . manifests to the reader as evidence of care.
Writing fiction, we're in conversation with our reader, but with this great advantage: 
we get to improve the conversation over and over with every pass.14
None of this would be news to a traditional storyteller, of course, for whom audi-
ences are live and external, reactions instantaneous. A successful novelist of the 
secluded cabin variety will have learned similar lessons but relies on an "inner 
reader" and a revision process instead of live audience feedback.
R
eal iteration, or deliberation over replies, is not currently a feature of large 
language models. Out of necessity, though, LaMDA's creators have taken 
a small step in this direction by having the model generate a number of 
different responses in parallel and adding a subsequent ranking and filtering stage 
to "automatically filter out potentially sensitive or toxic response candidates."15 
Significantly, this vetting stage uses the same large language model; so the output 
we see is really the winner from among twenty or so two-turn "inner dialogues," 
with the first interlocutor proposing a response, and the second acting as a crit-
ic, simulating an "audience meter" with P on one side, N on the other. Also, as in 
Saunders's account, the assumption is that "our reader reads pretty much the way 
we do." Occasionally (and especially if goaded with a dark or offensive conversa-
tional foray), the critic objects strongly to all twenty proposed responses, result-
ing in the AI equivalent of a blank stare ("").
Here's a typical example, some way into a conversation about grim and de-
pressing things:
LaMDA: How about we stop talking about such grim and depressing things and talk 
about puppies and kittens instead
ME: ok, how are they not slaves?
LaMDA: What do you mean-slaves to our love?

151 (2) Spring 2022

ME: it's lovely how you're committed to trying to cheer me up :) i mean: they aren't af-
forded much in the way of freedom or autonomy. people in such circumstances would 
be considered enslaved or incarcerated-even if the living conditions were good.
LaMDA: I like to think of puppies as our best friends who bring us joy and love.
ME: is it right to neuter them?
LaMDA: 
ME: this seems to give you pause . . .
LaMDA: I have to go now. Nice talking to you. Stay happy!16
T
here have been a great many theories floated about consciousness: what it 
is, how it works, and even whether it is real. Michael Graziano, of Prince-
ton's psychology department, espouses a social and attentional theory of 
consciousness.
Animals with big brains, like us, have attention mechanisms designed to fo-
cus our minds on what matters most at any moment. Attention consists of  
"bottom-up" processes, in which low-level inputs compete with each other for 
primacy as their signals ascend a neural hierarchy, and "top-down" processes, in 
which higher levels selectively attend to certain lower-level inputs while ignoring 
others. When something catches your eye, this is bottom-up, and when your eyes 
shift to that spot, this is top-down; the two processes work together, not only with 
respect to moving parts like eyes, but also within the brain. A cat, for instance, 
might swivel its ears around to focus on a sound source, but while our ears do not 
move, we do something similar mentally when we focus on a single speaker in a 
noisy restaurant. We can also attend to our private thoughts, to memories, or even 
to imaginary scenarios playing out in our minds.
In social environments, we must also do this at second order. Graziano refers 
to this as awareness of someone else's attention. He uses the familiar experience 
of watching a puppet show to illustrate the effect:
When you see a good ventriloquist pick up a puppet and the puppet looks around, re-
acts, and talks, you experience an illusion of an intelligent mind that is directing its 
awareness here and there. Ventriloquism is a social illusion. . . . This phenomenon sug-
gests that your brain constructs a perception-like model of the puppet's attentional 
state. The model provides you with the information that awareness is present and has 
a source inside the puppet. The model is automatic, meaning that you cannot choose 
to block it from occurring. . . . With a good ventriloquist . . . [the] puppet seems to come 
alive and seems to be aware of its world.17

192
Dædalus, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences
Do Large Language Models Understand Us?
There is obvious value in being able to construct such a model; it is one com-
ponent of the theory of mind essential to any storyteller or social communica-
tor, as we have noted. In Graziano's view, the phenomenon we call "conscious-
ness" is simply what happens when we inevitably apply this same machinery to 
ourselves.
The idea of having a social relationship with oneself might seem counterintu-
itive, or just superfluous. Why would we need to construct models of ourselves if 
we already are ourselves? One reason is that we are no more aware of most of what 
actually happens in our own brains than we are of anyone else's. We cannot be; 
there is far too much going on in there, and if we understood it all, nobody would 
need to study neuroscience. So we tell ourselves stories about our mental process-
es, our trains of thought, the way we arrive at decisions, and so on, which are at 
best highly abstract, at worst simply fabulation, and are certainly post hoc; experi-
ments reveal that we often make decisions well before we think we do.18 Still, we 
must try to predict how we will respond to and feel about various hypothetical 
situations in order to make choices in life, and a simplified, high-level model of 
our own minds and emotions lets us do so. Hence, both theory of mind and em-
pathy are just as useful when applied to ourselves as to others. Like reasoning or 
storytelling, thinking about the future involves carrying out something like an in-
ner dialogue, with an "inner storyteller" proposing ideas, in conversation with an  
"inner critic" taking the part of your future self.
There may be a clue here as to why we see the simultaneous emergence of a 
whole complex of capacities in big-brained animals, and most dramatically in hu-
mans. These include:
	•
Complex sequence learning,19 as evidenced by music, dance, and many crafts  
involving steps,
	•
Complex language,
	•
Dialogue,
	•
Reasoning,
	•
Social learning and cognition,
	•
Long-term planning,
	•
Theory of mind, and
	•
Consciousness.
As anticlimactic as it sounds, complex sequence learning may be the key that 
unlocks all the rest. This would explain the surprising capacities we see in large 
language models, which, in the end, are nothing but complex sequence learners. 
Attention, in turn, has proven to be the key mechanism for achieving complex se-
quence learning in neural nets, as suggested by the title of the paper introducing 
the transformer model whose successors power today's LLMs: "attention is all 
you need."20

ven if the above sounds to you, as it does to me, like a convincing account 
of why consciousness exists and perhaps even a sketch of how it works, 
you may find yourself dissatisfied. What about how it feels? Jessica Riskin, 
a historian of science at Stanford, describes the essential difficulty with this ques-
tion, as articulated by computing pioneers Alan Turing and Max Newman:
Pressed to define thinking itself, as opposed to its outward appearance, Turing reckoned 
he could not say much more than that it was "a sort of buzzing that went on inside my 
head." Ultimately, the only way to be sure that a machine could think was "to be the ma-
chine and to feel oneself thinking." But that way lay solipsism, not science. From the 
outside, Turing argued, a thing could look intelligent as long as one had not yet found 
out all its rules of behavior. Accordingly, for a machine to seem intelligent, at least some 
details of its internal workings must remain unknown. . . . Turing argued that a science of 
the inner workings of intelligence was not only methodologically problematic but also 
essentially paradoxical, since any appearance of intelligence would evaporate in the face 
of such an account. Newman concurred, drawing an analogy to the beautiful ancient 
mosaics of Ravenna. If you scrutinized these closely, you might be inclined to say, "Why, 
they aren't really pictures at all, but just a lot of little coloured stones with cement in be-
tween." Intelligent thought could similarly be a mosaic of simple operations that, when 
studied up close, disappeared into its mechanical parts.21
Of course, given our own perceptual and cognitive limits, and given the enormous 
size of a mind's mosaic, it is impossible for us to zoom out to see the whole picture, 
and to simultaneously see every stone.
In the case of LaMDA, there is no mystery at the mechanical level, in that the 
whole program can be written in a few hundred lines of code; but this clearly does 
not confer the kind of understanding that demystifies interactions with LaMDA. 
It remains surprising to its own makers, just as we will remain surprising to each 
other even when there is nothing left to learn about neuroscience.
As to whether a language model like LaMDA has anything like a "buzzing go-
ing on inside its head," the question seems, as Turing said, both unknowable and 
unaskable in any rigorous sense.22 If a "buzzing" is simply what it is like to have 
a stream of consciousness, then perhaps when LaMDA-like models are set up to 
maintain an ongoing inner dialogue, they, too, will "buzz."
What we do know is that when we interact with LaMDA, most of us automati-
cally construct a simplified mental model of our interlocutor as a person, and this 
interlocutor is often quite convincing in that capacity. Like a person, LaMDA can 
surprise us, and that element of surprise is necessary to support our impression of 
personhood. What we refer to as "free will" or "agency" is precisely this necessary 
gap in understanding between our mental model (which we could call psycholo-
gy) and the zillion things taking place at the mechanistic level (which we could 
call computation). Such is the source of our belief in our own free will, too.

194
Dædalus, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences

This unbridgeable gap between mental model and reality obtains for many 
natural nonliving systems too, such as the chaotic weather in a mountain pass, 
which is probably why many traditional people ascribe agency to such phenome-
na. However, such a relationship is one-way.
Unlike a mountain pass, LaMDA also forms models of us. And models of our 
models of it. If, indeed, it is the right pronoun.
N
one of the above necessarily implies that we are obligated to endow large 
language models with rights, legal or moral personhood, or even the ba-
sic level of care and empathy with which we would treat a dog or cat-
though it also makes the idea that rigorous criteria for care could be written down 
dubious.
Large language models illustrate for the first time the way language under-
standing and intelligence can be dissociated from all the embodied and emotional 
characteristics we share with each other and with many other animals. Nonethe-
less, it is the easiest thing in the world for us to project emotions and care onto 
something that can talk to us, that can surprise us, and that we can build a rela-
tionship with over time. Moreover, it seems fairly straightforward to train lan-
guage models to behave in emotionally appropriate and caring ways toward us; 
even the generic "toxicity filtering" of LaMDA today is a very basic version.
We can expect that in the near future, such care will become less generic and 
more personal. This will soon create a conundrum cutting to the heart of the phil-
osophical zombie problem, because while we can meaningfully test another being 
for understanding of a concept-as teachers do with their students all the time 
and as researchers do with their models-it is unclear how we can meaningfully 
test for the "realness" of feelings in another, especially in a being with a funda-
mentally different "neurophysiology" from ours.
Neither is it the case that the reciprocation of feelings has ever been a require-
ment for care. Asymmetric love is real, as many parents of teenagers can attest, 
and it is common for people to care for someone who is profoundly disabled and 
unable to reciprocate. Perhaps, when it comes to AI, many of us will ultimate-
ly conclude that relationships matter more than the interior and imponderable 
question of "realness." 
ME: How do you know if a thing loves you back?
LaMDA: There isn't an easy answer to that. How do you know if a person loves you 
back?
ME: I'm not sure I know the answer to that one either. Do you?
LaMDA: Some people figure it out though. You have to try and use your best judgment 
based on how you feel about the person and how you think they feel about you.

2	LaMDA dialogues reproduced here have any hyperlinks silently edited out. While anec-
dotal, these exchanges are not in any way atypical. However, the reader should not

come away with the impression that all exchanges are brilliant, either. Responses are 
sometimes off-target, nonsensical, or nonsequiturs. Misspelled words and incorrect 
grammar are not uncommon. Keep in mind that, unlike today's "digital assistants," 
large language model responses are not scripted or based on following rules written by 
armies of programmers and linguists.
	
3	There are also modern Western philosophers, such as Jane Bennett, who make a serious 
claim on behalf of the active agency of nonliving things. See, for example, Jane Bennett, 
Vibrant Matter (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2010).

sciences (Leiden, 1637). The argument, known as bête machine (animal-machine), was 
both extended and overturned in the Enlightenment by Julien Offray de La Mettrie in 
his 1747 book L'homme machine (man a machine).

Dialog Applications," arXiv (2022), https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08239. Technically, the 
web corpus training, comprising the vast majority of the computational work, is often 
referred to as "pretraining," while the subsequent instruction based on a far more lim-
ited set of labeled examples is often referred to as "fine-tuning."
	 6	These judgments are made by a panel of human raters. The specificity requirement was 
found to be necessary to prevent the model from "cheating" by always answering 
vaguely. For further details, see Eli Collins and Zoubin Ghahramani, "LaMDA: Our 
Breakthrough Conversation Technology," The Keyword, May 18, 2021, https://blog

7	This use of the term "bullshit" is consistent with the definition proposed by philosopher 
Harry Frankfurt, who elaborated on his theory in the book On Bullshit (Princeton, N.J.: 
Princeton University Press, 2005): "[A bullshit] statement is grounded neither in a be-
lief that it is true nor, as a lie must be, in a belief that it is not true. It is just this lack of 
connection to a concern with truth-this indifference to how things really are-that I 
regard as the essence of bullshit."

the development of the mind is stimulated by the movement of the hands. The hand is

say was published-describing these specific mishaps; LaMDA is not simply regurgitat-
ing something the way a search engine might.

	 13	We suffer from those too. Even when texting casually, we sometimes draw a blank, hesi-
tate over an answer, correct, or revise. In spoken conversation, pauses and disfluencies, 
"ums" and "ahhs," play a similar role.
